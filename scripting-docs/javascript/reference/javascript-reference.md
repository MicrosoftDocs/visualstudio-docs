# JavaScript Reference
These sections explain the elements that make up the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have joined the community-wide effort to make [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) the web’s one-stop, premiere development resource, by redirecting all (500+ pages) of Microsoft’s JavaScript API reference from docs.microsoft.com to their MDN counterparts. For details, see this [announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/18/documenting-web-together-mdn-web-docs/#kATurs7yL2KOjFcz.97).
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code in Internet Explorer can interact with HTML, CSS and the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents HTML and browser objects.  
  
-   For information about HTML, see [HTML/XHTML Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251007).  
  
-   For information about CSS, see [Cascading Style Sheets](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251008).  
  
-   For information about the DOM, see [Document Object Model (DOM)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251009).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] code can be used in browser applications as well as [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps. [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps are supported in [!INCLUDE[win8](../../javascript/includes/win8-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../javascript/includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[win81](../../javascript/includes/win81-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../../javascript/includes/vs-dev12-md.md)].  
  
-   For information about JavaScript in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../javascript/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps, see [JavaScript roadmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4f28182b-1e4b-4bbd-8ae9-dcc504de4341).
