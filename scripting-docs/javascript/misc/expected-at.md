# Expected '\@'
You attempted to create a variable to be used with conditional compilation statements using the `@set` statement, but did not place an at sign "**@**" before the variable name.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Add an at sign "**@**" immediately before the variable name. For example:  
  
    ```JavaScript  
    @set @myvar = 1  
    ```
