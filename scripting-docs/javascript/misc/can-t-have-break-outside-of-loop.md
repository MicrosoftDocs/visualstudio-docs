# Can't have 'break' outside of loop
You attempted to use the **break** keyword outside of a loop. The **break** keyword is used to terminate a loop or `switch` statement. It must be embedded in the body of a loop or `switch` statement. However, a **label** can follow the break keyword.  
  
```js
break labelname;  
```  
  
 You only need the labeled form of the **break** keyword when you are using nested loops or `switch` statements and need to break out of a loop that is not the innermost one.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Make sure the **break** keyword appears inside an enclosing loop or switch statement.
