# Conditional compilation is turned off
You attempted to use a conditional compilation variable without first turning conditional compilation on. Turning on conditional compilation tells the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] compiler to interpret identifiers beginning with @ as conditional compilation variables. You do this by beginning your conditional code with the statement:  
  
```js
/*@cc_on @*/  
```  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the following statement to the beginning of your conditional code:  
  
    ```JavaScript  
    /*@cc_on @*/  
    ```
