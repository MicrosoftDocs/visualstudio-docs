# The URI to be decoded is not a valid encoding
You attempted to decode an improperly formed URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). URIs have a special syntax; most non-alphanumeric characters must be encoded before they can be used in a URI. You can use the `encodeURI` and `encodeURIComponent` methods to create a URI from a normal [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] string.  
  
 A complete URI is composed of a sequence of components and separators. The general form is:  
  
```JavaScript  
<Scheme>:<first>/<second>;<third>?<fourth>  
```  
  
 The names in angle brackets represent components, and the ":", "/", ";" and "?" are reserved characters used as separators.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure you are trying to decode valid URIs only. You cannot decode normal [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] strings, as they may contain invalid characters.
