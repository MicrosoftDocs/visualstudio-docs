# Label not found
You made a reference to a label that does not exist. Labels can be used to mark blocks of code, but within a specified scope, must be unique.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Check to make sure you did not misspell the label name.  
  
- Ensure all label references are made to labels that have been defined in the current scope (this includes forward definitions).
