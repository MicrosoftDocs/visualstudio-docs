# Expected ':'
You attempted to create an expression using the ternary conditional operator, but did not include the colon between the second and third operands. The ternary (three operands) conditional operator requires a colon between the second (true) and third (false) operands.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Insert a colon between the second and third operands.
