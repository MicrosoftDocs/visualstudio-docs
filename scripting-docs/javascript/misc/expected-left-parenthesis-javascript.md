# Expected '(' (JavaScript)
You attempted to enclose an expression within a set of parentheses, but did not include the opening parenthesis. Some expressions must be enclosed within a set of opening and closing parentheses. Notice the use of parentheses in the following example.  
  
```JavaScript  
for (initialize; test; increment) {  
statement;  
}  
```  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Add the left parenthesis to the evaluation expression.
