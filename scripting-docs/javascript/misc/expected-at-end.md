# Expected '\@end'
You attempted to create a conditionally compiled block of code, but did not include the <strong>@end</strong> statement at the end. [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] statements can be conditionally compiled by enclosing them within an <strong>@if/@end</strong> block.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Add the corresponding <strong>@end</strong> statement.
