# JavaScript object expected
You attempted to pass a non-[!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] object to a built-in function that expects a [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] object. Various built-in functions require objects defined in [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] (as opposed to objects defined by the host, or an external component like a control).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Ensure that the object you are passing in as a parameter is of the correct type.
