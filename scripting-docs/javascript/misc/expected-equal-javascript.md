# Expected '=' (JavaScript)
You attempted to create a variable to be used with conditional compilation statements, but did not place an equal sign between the variable and the value you want to assign to it.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Add an equal sign. For example:  
  
    ```JavaScript  
    @set @myvar1 = 1  
    ```
