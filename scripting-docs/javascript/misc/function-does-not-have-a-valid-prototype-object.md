# Function does not have a valid prototype object
You attempted to use **instanceof** to determine if an object was derived from a particular function class, but you redefined the object's `prototype` property as either `null`, or an external object type (both not valid [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] objects). An external object can be an object from the host object model (for example, Internet Explorer's document or window object), or an external COM object.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure the function's `prototype` property refers to a valid [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] object.
