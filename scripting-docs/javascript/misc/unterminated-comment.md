# Unterminated comment
You began a multi-line comment block, but did not properly terminate it. Multi-line comments begin with a "/*" combination, and end with the reverse "\*/" combination. The following is an example:  
  
```JavaScript  
/* This is a comment  
This is another part of the same comment.*/  
```  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Be sure to terminate multi-line comments with "*/".
