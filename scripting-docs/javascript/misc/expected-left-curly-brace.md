# Expected '{'
You did not include the left brace that marks the beginning of the function body. Code that makes up the body of a function, even if it is a single line, must be contained within left and right braces. Notice that the use of braces in function bodies is stricter than in loops.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the left brace that marks the beginning of the function body.
