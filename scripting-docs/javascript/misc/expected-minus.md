# Expected '-'
You attempted to create a regular expression literal, but did not include one of the slashes (/). Just as string literals are written as characters within a pair of quotation marks, regular expression literals are expressed as characters within a pair of slash (/) characters.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Insert a terminating forward slash to mark the end of the regular expression.
