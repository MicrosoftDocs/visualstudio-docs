# Expected ')' in regular expression (JavaScript)
You attempted to create a regular expression capture, assertion, or group, but did not include the closing parenthesis. Parentheses have several purposes in regular expressions. Primarily, they are used to capture sub-expressions, to specify assertions, or to group patterns together so that the items can be treated as a single unit by *, +, ?, and so on.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the rightmost closing parentheses.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want to match a single parenthesis, escape it with a backslash - \\( - so that it is not interpreted as a special character by [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].
