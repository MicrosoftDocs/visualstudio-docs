# Object doesn't support this property or method
You specified a property or method that does not exist for this object. Not all objects support all properties and methods.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Check the properties and methods to ensure there were no typing errors.  
  
- Verify that the object's runtime type is the expected object type.  
  
- See the object's documentation for more information.
