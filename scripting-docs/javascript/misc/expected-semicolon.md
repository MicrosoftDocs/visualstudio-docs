# Expected ';'
You attempted to place more than one statement on a line, but did not separate them with semicolons. Semicolons are used to terminate statements. Although you can place several statements on a single line, each one must be delimited from the next with a semicolon.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Mark the end of each statement with a semicolon.  
  
- Make sure your function calls use parentheses properly.  
  
- Make sure you did not forget the semicolons inside the header of a **for** loop.
