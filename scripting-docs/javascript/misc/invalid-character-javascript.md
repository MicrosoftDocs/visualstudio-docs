# Invalid character (JavaScript)
You composed an identifier using a character (or characters) not recognized as valid by the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] compiler. Valid characters use the following rules:  
  
- The first character must be an ASCII letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).  
  
- Subsequent characters can be ASCII letters, numbers, or underscores.  
  
- The identifier name cannot be a reserved word.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Avoid using characters that are not part of the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] language definition.
