# Undefined identifier
You attempted to use an identifier that the [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)] compiler does not recognize. The undefined value is returned whenever you use:  
  
- a variable that does not exist,  
  
- a variable that has been declared, but never had a value assigned to it,  
  
- an object property that does not exist.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Declare the variable with a **var** statement (as in `var` x;).
