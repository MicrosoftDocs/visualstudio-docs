# Throw must be followed by an expression on the same source line
You used the `throw` keyword, but did not follow it with an expression on the same source line. A `throw` statement consists of two parts: the `throw` keyword, followed by the expression to be thrown. For example:  
  
```JavaScript  
if (denominator == 0) {  
 throw new DivideByZeroException();  
}  
```  
  
 You cannot split these two components up.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that the `throw` keyword and the expression to be thrown appears on the same line.
