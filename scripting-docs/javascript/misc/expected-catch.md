# Expected 'catch'
You used the exception handling **try** block, but did not write the associated **catch** statement. The exception handling mechanism requires that the code that can fail, along with the code that should not execute if an exception occurs, be wrapped inside a **try** block. Exceptions are thrown from within the **try** block using the **throw** statement, and caught outside the **try** block with one or more **catch** statements.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the associated **catch** block.  
  
-   Try using a **finally** block instead of a **catch** block.
