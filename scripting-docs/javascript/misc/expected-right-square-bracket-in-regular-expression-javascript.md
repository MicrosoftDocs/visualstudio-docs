# Expected ']' in regular expression (JavaScript)
You attempted to create a character class for a regular expression match, but did not include the right bracket. Individual literal character combinations can be assembled into character classes by placing them within brackets. A character class matches any one character it contains. For example, /[abc]/ matches any one of the letters "a", "b", or "c".  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Add the right bracket to the regular expression.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you want to match a single bracket, escape it with a backslash - \\[ - so it is not interpreted as a special character by [!INCLUDE[javascript](../../javascript/includes/javascript-md.md)].
