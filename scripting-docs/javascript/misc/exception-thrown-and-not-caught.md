# Exception thrown and not caught
You included a `throw` statement in your code, but it was not enclosed within a **try** block, or there was no associated **catch** block to trap the error. Exceptions are thrown from within the **try** block using the **throw** statement, and caught outside the **try** block with a **catch** statement.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Enclose code that can throw an exception in a **try** block, and ensure there is a corresponding **catch** block.  
  
-   Make sure your catch statement expects the correct form of exception.  
  
-   If the exception is rethrown, make sure there is another corresponding catch statement.
