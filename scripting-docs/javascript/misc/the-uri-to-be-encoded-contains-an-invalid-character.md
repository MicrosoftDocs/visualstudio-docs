# The URI to be encoded contains an invalid character
You attempted to encode a string as a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), but it contained invalid characters. Although most characters are valid inside strings to be converted to URIs, some Unicode character sequences are illegal.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure the string to be encoded contains only valid Unicode sequences. A complete URI is composed of a sequence of components and separators. The names in angle brackets represent components, and the ":", "/", ";" and "?" are reserved characters used as separators. The general form is:  
  
    ```JavaScript  
    <Scheme>:<first>/<second>;<third>?<fourth>  
    ```
