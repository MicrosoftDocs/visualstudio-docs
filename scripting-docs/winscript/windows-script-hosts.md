# Windows Script Hosts
When implementing Microsoft Windows Script host, you can safely assume that a scripting engine only calls the [IActiveScriptSite](../winscript/reference/iactivescriptsite.md) interface in the context of the base thread as long as the host does the following:  
  
- Chooses a base thread (generally the thread that contains the message loop).  
  
- Instantiates the scripting engine in the base thread.  
  
- Calls scripting engine methods only from the base thread, except where specifically allowed, as in the cases of [IActiveScript::InterruptScriptThread](../winscript/reference/iactivescript-interruptscriptthread.md) and [IActiveScript::Clone](../winscript/reference/iactivescript-clone.md).  
  
- Calls the scripting engine's dispatch object only from the base thread.  
  
- Ensures that the message loop runs in the base thread if a window handle is provided.  
  
- Ensures that objects in the host's object model only source events in the base thread.  
  
  These rules are automatically followed by all single-threaded hosts. The restricted model described above is intentionally loose enough to allow a host to abort a stuck script by calling [IActiveScript::InterruptScriptThread](../winscript/reference/iactivescript-interruptscriptthread.md) from another thread (initiated by a CTRL+BREAK handler or the like), or to duplicate a script in a new thread using [IActiveScript::Clone](../winscript/reference/iactivescript-clone.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 None of these restrictions apply to a host that chooses to implement a free-threaded [IActiveScriptSite](../winscript/reference/iactivescriptsite.md) interface and a free-threaded object model. Such a host can use the [IActiveScript](../winscript/reference/iactivescript.md) interface from any thread, without restriction.
