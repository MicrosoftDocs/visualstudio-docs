# ISimpleConnectionPoint::Advise
Establishes a connection between the simple connection point object and the client's sink.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Advise(  
   IDispatch*  pdisp,  
   DWORD*      pdwCookie  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdisp`  
 [in] Pointer to the `IDispatch` interface on the client's advise sink. The client's sink receives outgoing calls from the simple connection point.  
  
 `pdwCookie`  
 [out] Pointer to a returned token that uniquely identifies this connection. The caller uses this token later to delete the connection by passing it to the `ISimpleConnectionPoint::Unadvise` method. If the connection was not successfully established, this value is zero.  
  
## Return Value  
 The method returns an `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`S_OK`|The method succeeded.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method establishes a connection between the simple connection point object and the client's sink.
