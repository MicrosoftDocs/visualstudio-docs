# SCRIPTTHREADSTATE Enumeration
Specifies the state of a thread in a scripting engine. This enumeration is used by the [IActiveScript::GetScriptThreadState](../../winscript/reference/iactivescript-getscriptthreadstate.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp
typedef enum tagSCRIPTTHREADSTATE {  
    SCRIPTTHREADSTATE_NOTINSCRIPT  = 0,  
    SCRIPTTHREADSTATE_RUNNING      = 1  
} SCRIPTTHREADSTATE;  
```  
  
## Enumeration Values  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|SCRIPTTHREADSTATE_NOTINSCRIPT|Specified thread is not currently servicing a scripted event, processing immediately executed script text, or running a script macro.|  
|SCRIPTTHREADSTATE_RUNNING|Specified thread is actively servicing a scripted event, processing immediately executed script text, or running a script macro.|
