# IApplicationDebugger::CreateInstanceAtDebugger
Allows the creation of objects in the debugger process by code that is out-of-process to the debugger.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This method should not be implemented, because it allows untrusted code to create arbitrary objects in a trusted debugger thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CreateInstanceAtDebugger(  
   REFCLSID    rclsid,  
   IUnknown*   pUnkOuter,  
   DWORD       dwClsContext,  
   REFIID      riid,  
   IUnknown**  ppvObject  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `rclsid`  
 [in] Class identifier (CLSID) of the object to create.  
  
 `pUnkOuter`  
 [in] If `NULL`, the object is not being created as part of an aggregate. Otherwise, `pUnkOuter` is a pointer to the aggregate object's `IUnknown` interface (the controlling `IUnknown`).  
  
 `dwClsContext`  
 [in] Context for running executable code. The values are taken from the enumeration `CLSCTX`.  
  
 `riid`  
 [in] The interface identifier used to communicate with the object.  
  
 `ppvObject`  
 [out] Address of pointer variable that receives the interface pointer requested in `riid`. Upon successful return, *`ppvObject` contains the requested interface pointer. Upon failure, \*`ppvObject` contains `NULL`.  
  
## Return Value  
 The method returns an `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`S_OK`|The method succeeded.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method delegates to `CoCreateInstance`.  
  
 The method is not currently implemented.
