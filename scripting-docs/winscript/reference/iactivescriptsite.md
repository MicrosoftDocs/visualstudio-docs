# IActiveScriptSite
Implemented by the host to create a site for the Windows Script engine. Usually, this site will be associated with the container of all the objects that are visible to the script (for example, the ActiveX Controls). Typically, this container will correspond to the document or page being viewed. Microsoft Internet Explorer, for example, would create such a container for each HTML page being displayed. Each ActiveX control (or other automation object) on the page, and the scripting engine itself, would be enumerable within this container.
