# IDebugSyncOperation Interface
Allows a script engine to abstract an operation (such as expression evaluation) that needs to be performed while nested in a particular blocked thread. The interface also provides a mechanism for canceling unresponsive operations.  
  
 In addition to the methods inherited from `IUnknown`, the `IDebugSyncOperation` interface exposes the following methods.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
  
|Method|Description|

|[IDebugSyncOperation::GetTargetThread](../../winscript/reference/idebugsyncoperation-gettargetthread.md)|Returns the target application thread for this synchronous operation.|  
|[IDebugSyncOperation::Execute](../../winscript/reference/idebugsyncoperation-execute.md)|Synchronously performs the operation and returns.|  
|[IDebugSyncOperation::InProgressAbort](../../winscript/reference/idebugsyncoperation-inprogressabort.md)|Cancels an operation in progress on another thread.|
