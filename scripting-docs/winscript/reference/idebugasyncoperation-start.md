# IDebugAsyncOperation::Start
Causes the asynchronous operation to begin.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Start(  
   IDebugAsyncOperationCallBack*  padocb  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `padocb`  
 The callback interface that receives status events from this operation.  
  
## Return Value  
 The method returns an `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`S_OK`|The method succeeded.|  
|`E_UNEXPECTED`|An operation is already pending.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method causes `IDebugSyncOperation::Execute` to be called asynchronously in the thread obtained from `IDebugSyncOperation::GetTargetThread`. This method should be called only from within the debugger thread; otherwise, it will not return until the operation is complete.
