# IRemoteDebugApplication Interface
Represents a running application. It does not need to correspond to an operating-system process. Typically, a debugger targets an application for debugging. The Process Debug Manager typically implements the application object.  
  
 In addition to the methods inherited from `IUnknown`, the `IRemoteDebugApplication` interface exposes the following methods.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::ResumeFromBreakPoint](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-resumefrombreakpoint.md)|Continues an application that is currently in a breakpoint.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::CauseBreak](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-causebreak.md)|Causes the application to break into the debugger at the earliest opportunity.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::ConnectDebugger](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-connectdebugger.md)|Connects a debugger to this application.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::DisconnectDebugger](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-disconnectdebugger.md)|Disconnects the current debugger from the application.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::GetDebugger](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-getdebugger.md)|Returns the current debugger connected to the application.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::CreateInstanceAtApplication](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-createinstanceatapplication.md)|Provides a mechanism for the debugger IDE, running out-of-process to the application, to create objects in the application process.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::QueryAlive](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-queryalive.md)|Indicates if the application is responsive.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::EnumThreads](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-enumthreads.md)|Enumerates all threads known to be associated with the application.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::GetName](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-getname.md)|Returns the name of this application node.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::GetRootNode](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-getrootnode.md)|Returns the application node under which all nodes associated with the application are added.|  
|[IRemoteDebugApplication::EnumGlobalExpressionContexts](../../winscript/reference/iremotedebugapplication-enumglobalexpressioncontexts.md)|Enumerates the global expression contexts for all languages running in this application.|
