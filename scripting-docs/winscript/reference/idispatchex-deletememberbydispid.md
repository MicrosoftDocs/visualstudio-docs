# IDispatchEx::DeleteMemberByDispID
Deletes a member by DISPID.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT DeleteMemberByDispID(  
    DISPID id  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `id`  
 Member identifier. Uses `GetDispID` or `GetNextDispID` to obtain the dispatch identifier.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns one of the following values:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|`S_OK`|Success.|  
|`S_FALSE`|Member exists but cannot be deleted.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If the member is deleted, the DISPID needs to remain valid for `GetNextDispID`.  
  
 If a member with a given name is deleted and later a member with the same name is recreated, the DISPID should be the same. (Whether member names that differ only by case are the "same" is object-dependent.)  
  
## Example  
  
```  
BSTR bstrName;  
DISPID dispid;  
IDispatchEx *pdex;   
  
// Assign to pdex and bstrName  
if (SUCCEEDED(pdex->GetDispID(bstrName, fdexNameCaseSensitive, &dispid)))  
    pdex->DeleteMemberByDispID(dispid);  
```
