# IActiveScriptSiteWindow
This interface is implemented by hosts that support a user interface on the same object as [IActiveScriptSite](../../winscript/reference/iactivescriptsite.md) . Hosts that do not support a user interface, such as servers, would not implement the `IActiveScriptSiteWindow` interface. The scripting engine accesses this interface by calling `QueryInterface` from `IActiveScriptSite`.
