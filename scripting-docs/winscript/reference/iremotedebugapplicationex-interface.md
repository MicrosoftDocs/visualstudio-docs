# IRemoteDebugApplicationEx Interface
Represents a running application. It does not need to correspond to an operating system process. Typically, a debugger targets an application for debugging. The Process Debug Manager typically implements the application object.  
  
 In addition to the methods inherited from `IUnknown`, the `IRemoteDebugApplicationEx` interface exposes the following methods.
