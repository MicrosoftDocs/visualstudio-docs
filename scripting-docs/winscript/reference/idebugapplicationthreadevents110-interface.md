# IDebugApplicationThreadEvents110 Interface
Adds more thread events. These events are local only. That is, you can subscribe to them only in the process being debugged, using the [IConnectionPoint](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232738) advise and unadvise methods on PDM application thread objects (objects that implement [IDebugApplicationThread Interface](../../winscript/reference/idebugapplicationthread-interface.md)). They occur on the thread they are coming from.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This interface is implemented by PDM v11.0 and greater. Found in activdbg100.h.
