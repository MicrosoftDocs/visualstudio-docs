# DEBUG_TEXT Constants
Used during [IDebugExpressionContext::ParseLanguageText](../../winscript/reference/idebugexpressioncontext-parselanguagetext.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef DWORD DEBUG_TEXT;  
```  
  
## Constants  
  
|Constant|Value|Description|  
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|DWORD DEBUG_TEXT_ISEXPRESSION|0x00000001|Indicates that the text is an expression as opposed to a statement. This flag may affect the way in which the text is parsed by some languages.|  
|DEBUG_TEXT_RETURNVALUE|0x00000002|If a return value is available, it will be used by the caller.|  
|DEBUG_TEXT_NOSIDEEFFECTS|0x00000004|Don't allow side effects. If this flag is set, the evaluation of the expression should change no runtime state.|  
|DEBUG_TEXT_ALLOWBREAKPOINTS|0x00000008|Allow breakpoints during the evaluation of the text. If this flag is not set, then breakpoints will be ignored during the evaluation of the text.|  
|DEBUG_TEXT_ALLOWERRORREPORT|0x00000010|Allow error reports during the evaluation of the text. If this flag is not set, then errors will not be reported to the host during the evaluation.|  
|DEBUG_TEXT_EVALUATETOCODECONTEXT|0x00000020|Indicates that the expression is to be evaluated to a code context rather than running the expression itself.|
