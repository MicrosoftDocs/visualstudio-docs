# IActiveScriptParse32::InitNew
Initializes the scripting engine.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp
HRESULT InitNew(void);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns `S_OK` if successful, or `E_FAIL` if an error occurred during initialization.  
  
## Remarks  
 Before the scripting engine can be used, one of the following methods must be called: `IPersist*::Load`, `IPersist*::InitNew`, or `IActiveScriptParse32::InitNew`. The semantics of this method are identical to `IPersistStreamInit::InitNew`, in that this method tells the scripting engine to initialize itself. Note that it is not valid to call both `IPersist*::InitNew` or `IActiveScriptParse32::InitNew` and `IPersist*::Load`, nor is it valid to call `IPersist*::InitNew`, `IActiveScriptParse32::InitNew`, or `IPersist*::Load` more than once.
