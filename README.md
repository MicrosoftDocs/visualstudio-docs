## Contribute to the documentation

We welcome your contributions to help us improve the Visual Studio docs. All the articles in this repository use GitHub-flavored markdown.

Several feature areas of Visual Studio have their own folders in this repo, such as **debugger** for topics on debugging, **ide** for topics on the Visual Studio interactive development environment (IDE), and so forth. The **/media** subfolder in each folder contains art files for the topics.
