# Visual Studio documentation

Welcome! This repo contains source files for the Visual Studio technical documentation. The topics are published at [Visual Studio product family documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio).

This repo was moved on June 23, 2017 from https://github.com/Microsoft/vsdocs.

The documentation for Visual Basic and Visual C# is located in the [dotnet docs repo](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/tree/main/docs), and the Visual C++ documentation is located in the [C++ docs repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs).

## Submit feedback

The Learn site is changing how we receive feedback on the documentation. The new way is already available by clicking on the Feedback icon at the top right of each article, or immediately following an article. See [Announcing a new way to give feedback on Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/contentuserfeedback).

## Contribute to the documentation

We welcome your contributions to help us improve the Visual Studio docs. All the articles in this repository use GitHub-flavored markdown.

Several feature areas of Visual Studio have their own folders in this repo, such as **debugger** for topics on debugging, **ide** for topics on the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), and so forth. The **/media** subfolder in each folder contains art files for the topics.
