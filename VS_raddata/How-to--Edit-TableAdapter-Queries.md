# How to: Edit TableAdapter Queries
You edit TableAdapter queries with the [Editing TableAdapters](../VS_raddata/Editing-TableAdapters.md) in the **Dataset Designer**. You should modify a TableAdapter query when it no longer suits the needs of your application. (Alternatively, you can create additional queries on the TableAdapter. For more information on adding new queries, see [How to: Create TableAdapter Queries](../VS_raddata/How-to--Create-TableAdapter-Queries.md).)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the [TableAdapter Configuration Wizard](../Topic/TableAdapter%20Configuration%20Wizard.md) opens instead of the **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard**, you might have selected the TableAdapter's main `Fill` query and not one of the TableAdapter's additional queries. For information on editing the TableAdapter's main `Fill` query, see [How to: Edit TableAdapters](../Topic/How%20to:%20Edit%20TableAdapters.md).

### To edit a TableAdapter query  
  
1.  Open the dataset in the **Dataset Designer**. For more information, see [How to: Open a Dataset in the Dataset Designer](../Topic/How%20to:%20Open%20a%20Dataset%20in%20the%20Dataset%20Designer.md).  
  
2.  Select the TableAdapter query you want to edit.  
  
3.  Right-click the TableAdapter query and select **Configure**.  
  
     The **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard** opens, ready for you to modify the query or stored procedure for that query.  
  
4.  Complete the **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard** with the changes that you want. For more information, see [Editing TableAdapters](../VS_raddata/Editing-TableAdapters.md).
