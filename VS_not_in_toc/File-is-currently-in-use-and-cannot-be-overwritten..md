# File is currently in use and cannot be overwritten.
The current file cannot be saved. This error generally occurs when you attempt to save one file using the name of a file also open at the same time.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Close the file with the same name and try again.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Rename the file and then save it.
