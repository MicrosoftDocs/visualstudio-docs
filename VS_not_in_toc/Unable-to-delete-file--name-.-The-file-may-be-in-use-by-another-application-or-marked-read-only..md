# Unable to delete file &lt;name&gt;. The file may be in use by another application or marked read-only.
This error generally occurs when the keyboard scheme selected to be deleted is either in use or is read-only.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  If another application is using the specified file, close that application  
  
     —or—  
  
     If the file is read-only, remove the read-only attribute. You can modify the read-only attribute in the Properties dialog box for the file, available in File Explorer.
