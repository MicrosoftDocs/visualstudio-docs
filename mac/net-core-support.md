> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously using .NET Core v2.2.1xx with Visual Studio for Mac 8.0, you'll need to manually update to a supported version of .NET Core, as listed in the table above. We recommend either [2.1.700](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) or [2.2.300](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

* .NET Core v2.1.700 is installed by default with the installer.
* To download any other version of .NET Core, visit the [dotnet page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
* For information on installing a preview version of Visual Studio for Mac, see the [Install a Preview Release](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mac/install-preview) guide.
