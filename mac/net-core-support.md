> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously using .NET Core v2.2.1xx with Visual Studio for Mac 8.0, you'll need to manually update to a supported version of .NET Core, as listed in the table above. We recommend either [2.1.700](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) or [2.2.300](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

* .NET Core v3.1 is installed by default for 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6.
* .NET Core v3.0 is installed by default for 8.3.
* .NET Core v2.1.701 (v2.1.700 for 8.1) is installed by default with the installer.
* To download any other version of .NET Core, visit the [dotnet page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
* When using .NET Core 3.0, C# version 8 will be used by default. C# 7.3 is default when using .NET Core 2.x. See [C# language versioning](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version) for more info.
* For information on installing a preview version of Visual Studio for Mac, see the [Install a Preview Release](/visualstudio/mac/install-preview) guide.
