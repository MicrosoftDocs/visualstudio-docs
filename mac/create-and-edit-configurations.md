# Creating and editing build configurations

Build configurations give you precise control over a build allowing you to create configurations to cater to different testing and distribution situations. You can create build configurations for individual projects or on a solution-wide basis.

You can create new configurations and edit existing ones for both projects and solutions using the Project Options dialog.
