# Set IDE accessibility options

In addition to features built right into macOS, Visual Studio for Mac has a number of accessibility features to enable users of varying abilities.

## Resize pad and editor content

1. Choose the pad or window for which you want to resize the content.

1. Choose **View (menu)**, and then select **Zoom In (&#8984;+)** or **Zoom Out (&#8984;-)**.

> [!TIP]
> To reset the content to the default size, you can choose **View (menu)** > **Normal Size (&#8984;0)**.

## Change the content font and size

It's possible to customize the font and size of content in most pads in Visual Studio for Mac. Here's how:

1. Go to **Visual Studio (menu)** > **Preferences... (&#8984;,)**.

1. In **Preferences**, go to **Environment** > **Fonts**.

1. For either **Text Editor**, **General Pad Text**, or **Output Pad Contents**, select the font and size button.

1. Select your desired font, style, and size, and select **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> To return to the default font and style for each setting, select **Set to Default**.

## Change the editor syntax highlighting

Some users might find that the default color scheme doesn't meet their contrast or color requirements. Visual Studio for Mac has a number of alternative themes that the user can select, including two high contrast themes.

1. Go to **Visual Studio (menu)** > **Preferences... (&#8984;,)**.

1. In **Preferences**, go to **Text Editor** > **Color Theme**.

1. Select your desired theme.

> [!TIP]
> The theme will update in the editor in real time, so you can preview and select your preferred theme.
