# Troubleshooting: Why can I not see all available templates?

In the New Project Dialog you only see the templates of components that have been installed. If you are missing any following components, make sure the correct components are installed, as described below:

|Missing Template  |Component to Install  |
|---------|---------|
|Android     |Android        |
|iOS     |iOS         |
|tvOS     |iOS         |
|watchOS     |iOS         |
|Multiplatform     |Android and iOS         |
|Mac     |macOS (Cocoa)         |
|.NET Core     |.NET Core         |

Run the VisualStudioForMacInstaller.dmg again to install the components. If you no longer have it, you can download it from the [Visual Studio for Mac](https://aka.ms/vsmac) webpage.
