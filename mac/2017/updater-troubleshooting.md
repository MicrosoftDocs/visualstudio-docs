# Troubleshooting: Updater has errors retrieving information

On a rare occasion, you may see the error message "Error retrieving update information" displayed when you try to [update Visual Studio for Mac](update.md). If this happens, try the following steps to fix it:

- Check your internet connection. A drop in the connection is the most common cause of this error.
  - If a component fails to download, you can click the retry button next to the component name to try the download again.
- Restart the IDE.
- If you continue to see this error message, you can also try to update using the Visual Studio 2017 for Mac Installer, if the **.dmg** is still on your machine, or you can download it from [my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=Visual%20Studio%20for%20Mac)
  - The installer will update any installed components on your machine.
  - By re-running the installer, you'll also be able to install any missing components that you had not previously installed.
