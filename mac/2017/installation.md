# Install Visual Studio 2017 for Mac

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio 2019 for Mac is [now available](installation.md?view=vsmac-2019). For older versions of Visual Studio for Mac, see the Visual Studio [downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=Visual%20Studio%202017%20for%20Mac).

## Downgrading from Visual Studio 2019 for Mac?

For the best experience, before you downgrade you should ensure that you [uninstall](uninstall.md) Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. If you have issues that are causing you to download, make sure to let us know by [reporting a problem](report-a-problem.md).
 
## Requirements

To start developing native, cross-platform apps when you download Visual Studio for Mac there are a couple of things that you must install and set up in preparation.

For working with iOS in Visual Studio you need the following pieces:

- A Mac with macOS High Sierra 10.13 or above.
- Xcode 9.3 or above. The latest stable version is usually recommended.
- An Apple ID. If you don't have an Apple ID already you can create a new one at https://appleid.apple.com. It's necessary to have an Apple ID for installing and signing into Xcode.

## Install

1. Download Visual Studio for Mac from [my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=Visual%20Studio%202017%20for%20Mac)

2. Once the installer package is downloaded, click the **VisualStudioForMacInstaller.dmg** file to mount the installer and then run it by double-clicking the logo, as illustrated by the following image:

   ![Installer dialog](media/installer-image1.png)

3. You might be prompted with an alert dialog similar to the following image. In this case, click **Open**:

4. The installer inspects your system to verify which components need to be installed or updated:

5. You'll then be presented with an alert dialog asking you to acknowledge the Privacy and License terms. Press the **Continue** button to acknowledge the terms:

   ![License dialog](media/installer-image4.png)

6. The installer presents a list of required components that are missing and that need to be downloaded and installed. Select the products you wish to download here:

   ![Select Items](media/installer-image5.png)

   If you do not wish to install all platforms, use the guide below to help you decide which platforms to install:

   * **Apps using Xamarin**:
      - Xamarin.Forms – Select **Android** and **iOS** platforms.
      - iOS only – Select **iOS** platform (Note that you will need to install [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)).
      - Android only – Select **Android** platform (Note that you should also select the relevant dependencies).
      - Mac only – Select **macOS** platform (Note that you will need to install [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)).
      - Fully cross-platform Xamarin apps – Select **Android**, **iOS**, and **macOS** platforms.
   * **.NET Core applications** – Select **.NET Core** platform.
   * **ASP.NET Core Web Applications** – Select **.NET Core** platform.
   * **Cross-platform Unity Game Development** – No additional platforms need to be installed beyond Visual Studio for Mac. Refer to the [Unity setup guide](/visualstudio/mac/setup-vsmac-tools-unity) for more information on installing the Unity extension.

   This installation screen displays the version and size of each individual component. You can click each component to display a list of dependencies for that component (for Android), see additional packages that it downloads (for .NET Core), or view any additional applications required (for iOS and macOS):

7. Once you are happy with your selection, select the **Install and Update** button to start the installation process.

8. The installer starts the download and install process of the selected items:

   ![Finishing Installation](media/installer-image9.png)

9. You might be prompted to elevate the permissions necessary for individual components that are needed to complete installation. Enter your administrator credentials here to continue the installation process:

> [!NOTE]
> If you chose not install a platform or tool during the original installation (by unselecting it in step #6), you must run the [installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) again if you wish to add the components later.
