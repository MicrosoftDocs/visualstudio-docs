# User Accounts

Once you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio for Mac, you must sign in to activate your subscription in order to get access all features of Visual Studio for Mac.

By signing-in, you enable access to all the services associated with your user account, as well as all the accounts that are linked to that account. Your account settings roam with you wherever you use Visual Studio. You can configure permissions levels on a specific Visual Studio instance for individual users.
