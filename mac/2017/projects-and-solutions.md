# Projects and Solutions

Visual Studio for Mac provides a _Solution Pad_ to display a tree view of the entire open solution. The **Solution** pad allows easy access to source code, resources, user interfaces, and assembly references contained in individual projects. Solution Pad, by default, opens one solution at a time. Each solution can include many projects, and each project can contain many items.

## Using Projects and Solutions

To create a new Project or Solution, refer to the [Creating new Projects and Solutions](create-new-projects.md) article.

## Project and Solution Options

You can manage the properties of both projects and solutions by either double-clicking on the project or solution name, or by right-clicking and browsing to **Options**. More information on these options is provided in the [Managing Solutions and Project Properties](managing-solutions-and-project-properties.md) article.
