# ASP.NET Core Web App Deployment

An important step in developing web applications is publishing (deployment). You can publish to a remote environment, so that others can use the application, or for testing purposes. Visual Studio for Mac offers two options to publish your application. Publish to Azure App Service enables you to publish your web application to Azure App Service. Publish to Folder enables you to publish your application to a folder.

## Publish to Azure App Service

Using Visual Studio for Mac you can publish your web application directly to Azure App Service. To publish your ASP.NET Core web application to Azure App Service refer to the [Publish to Azure App Service](publish-app-svc.md) article.

## Publish to Folder

You can also publish your ASP.NET Core web applications to a folder. To learn more about how you can publish your web application to a folder refer to [Publish to Folder](publish-folder.md).
