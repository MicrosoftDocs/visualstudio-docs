# Set multiple startup projects

Visual Studio for Mac allows you to specify that more than one project should be started when you debug or run your solution.

## To set multiple startup projects

1. In Solution Pad, select the solution (the top node).

2. Right-click the solution node and then select **Set Startup Projects**:

3. The **Create Solution Run Configuration** dialog box opens. This dialog box allows you to create a new named Solution Run Configuration for your solution. You can use any name you like. The default name is `Multiple Projects`.

4. Select **Create Run Configuration**. The **Solution Options** dialog box opens with the new Solution Run Configuration selected:

5. Select the projects that you want to start when you debug or run your app from Visual Studio for Mac:

6. Select **OK**. The new Solution Run Configuration is set as the active run configuration:

   You can see that two projects are configured to start because both projects are **bold** in Solution Pad. In the toolbar, the new run configuration is set as the current Solution Run Configuration.
