# Managing app resources

App resource files, such as images, text files, and audio files, are necessary to your application but aren't compiled with the application. Each platform supported by Visual Studio for Mac handles these resources in different ways, as explained in the following guides:

## Xamarin.Forms

Xamarin.Forms code runs on multiple platforms - each of which has its own filesystem and each file system dictates how to read and write to files. In Xamarin.Forms you can manage app resources by using the native file APIs on each platform, or by adding files as embedded resources.
