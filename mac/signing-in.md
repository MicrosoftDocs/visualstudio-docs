# Sign in to Visual Studio for Mac

Signing in to Visual Studio for Mac is how you [activate your subscription](enable-subscription.md). When you download Visual Studio for Mac, you'll always get the Community edition by default. If you have a [Professional or Enterprise license](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/), you should sign-in on first run to unlock any additional features. In addition you'll also get the following:

* **Access to the Visual Studio Dev Essentials program** – This program includes free software offerings, training, support, and more. See [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://aka.ms/vsdevhelp) for more information.

* **Automatically connect to Azure** in the IDE without prompting again for credentials for the same account.

When you launch Visual Studio for Mac for the first time, you're prompted to log in using a Microsoft account. Use a Microsoft account that is connected to the license that you wish to use. If you do not have a Microsoft account, see [How do I sign up for an account](https://support.microsoft.com/instantanswers/d18cc497-d839-cf50-dea8-f99c95f2bd16/sign-up-for-a-microsoft-account).

If you do decide not to log in straight away, you'll be able to use an evaluation copy for 30 days. After 30 days you must log in to continue using your copy of Visual Studio for Mac.

## How to sign in to Visual Studio for Mac
