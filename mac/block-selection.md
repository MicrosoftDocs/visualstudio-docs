# Block selection

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio for Mac](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-mac-only.md)]

Visual Studio for Mac makes it straightforward to select, cut, copy, and paste sections of your code. Rectangular blocks of code can be highlighted and selected by using the **Option + Drag** command on the code block. The formatting within this block selection is retained when pasting the block.

Block selections can also be edited to modify text on multiple lines at once. A zero-width block selection can be used to place the caret in front of many lines at once, and allows typing identical text on multiple lines:
