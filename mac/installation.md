To build Xamarin apps for iOS or macOS, you'll also need:

- A Mac that is compatible with the latest version of Xcode. See Apple's [minimum requirements documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode). It may be possible to [use an older version of Xcode](/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/questions/old-version-xcode) if your Mac isn't compatible with the latest version.
- An Apple ID. If you don't have an Apple ID already, you can create a new one at https://appleid.apple.com. It's necessary to have an Apple ID for installing and signing into Xcode.

If you have network trouble while installing in a corporate environment, review the [installing behind a firewall or proxy](#install-visual-studio-for-mac-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server) instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you chose not to install a platform or tool during the original installation (by unselecting it in step #6), you must run the installer again if you wish to add the components later.

## Install Visual Studio for Mac behind a firewall or proxy server

To install Visual Studio for Mac behind a firewall, certain endpoints must be made accessible in order to allow downloads of the required tools and updates for your software.

Configure your network to allow access to the following locations:
