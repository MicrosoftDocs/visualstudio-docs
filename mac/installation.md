# Install Visual Studio 2019 for Mac

To start developing native, cross-platform .NET apps on macOS, install Visual Studio 2019 for Mac following the steps below.

 > [!div class="button"]
 > [Download Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)

## Requirements

- A Mac with macOS High Sierra 10.13 or above.

To build Xamarin apps for iOS or macOS, you'll also need:

- A Mac that is compatible with the latest version of Xcode. See Apple's [minimum requirements documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode). It may be possible to [use an older version of Xcode](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/troubleshooting/questions/old-version-xcode) if youre Mac is not compatible with the latest version of Xcode.
- An Apple ID. If you don't have an Apple ID already you can create a new one at https://appleid.apple.com. It's necessary to have an Apple ID for installing and signing into Xcode.
