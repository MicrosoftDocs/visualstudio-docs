# Integrated Terminal
In Visual Studio for Mac you can open an integrated terminal window, initially starting at the root of your solution. The terminal can be useful for different kinds of situations – running front-end tasks (for example: npm, ng, or vue), managing containers, running advanced git commands, executing Entity Framework commands, viewing dotnet CLI output, adding NuGet packages, and more. 

To open the terminal:
- Use the **Ctrl + `** keyboard shortcut to show or hide the terminal window.
- Use the **View** \> **Pads** \> **Terminal** menu.
- Use the **terminal** command from the search bar.

By default, when the terminal is launched it will:
- Set the working directory to the path of the current solution.
- Load the default system shell.

## Search
You can search the content of the terminal window by using the **Search > Find...** menu.

## Customizing the terminal window
### Configuring the Terminal Font
You can change the font and size used for Terminal Contents in the Preferences > Environment > Fonts pane. By default, the font will be the same as Output Pad Contents, using Menlo Regular, size 11. You can set it to any font, independent of your editor font.

### Reusing system terminal customizations
The integrated terminal uses the same defaults and configuration as your macOS system terminal. That means that your terminal customizations (zsh, oh-my-zsh, etc.) also work in the integrated terminal.
