# choco-install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `choco-install` tool can be used to install and update [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages.

## Usage

If both the `input` and `additionalOptions` properties are omitted or empty, then the tool will do nothing.

| Name                                             | Type   | Required  | Value                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **comments**                                     | string | No        | Optional comments property. Not used.                                                                          |
| [**input**](#input)                              | string | Yes       | The package to install. See [Input](#input) below for details.                                                 |
| [**additionalOptions**](#additional-options)     | string | No        | Additional options to pass to the tool. See [Additional options](#additional-options) below for details.       |

### Input

The `input` property is used to specify the name of the package to install (for example 'mongodb') or the path to a configuration file of the following formats _packages.config_, _.nuspec_, and _.nupkg_. The value of `input` will be append to a `choco install` command (for example `choco install mongodb`) along with any arguments specific in [`additionalOptions`](#additional-options) and the built-in `choco` options (defined [below](#built-in-options)). Packages are found in the [Chocolatey package gallery](https://chocolatey.org/packages). When using a configuration file, you can pass in the path to that file in the `input` property, for example `"input":"packages.config"`.

### Additional options

Additional configuration options can be passed in as a value of the `additionalOptions`. These arguments are direct passthrough to the arguments used by [`choco install`](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install) and are defined in chocolatey documentation.

#### Adding new feeds to Chocolatey
If you want to add a new feed to Chocolatey, similar to a `choco source add` command, you can pass in `additionalOptions` to do so. An example of adding a new feed is in [Example usage](#example-usage). If you wish to add a private feed, we recommend running the tool in the command prompt because it requires credentials. For example, `devinit run -t choco-install -i {package} -s "{feed link}" -u {user} -p {password}`, where `{package}`, `{feed link}`, `{user}`, and `{password}` refer to your specific package, feed link, username, and password. More information is in Chocolatey documentation referenced above. 

### Built-in options

The `choco-install` tool sets a number of `choco` command-line arguments to ensure that `choco` can run headless. These arguments are listed below and documentation on them can be found in the [chocolatey documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/).

| Name                  | Description                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **--yes**             | Confirm all prompts - Chooses affirmative answer instead of prompting. Implies `--accept-license.` |
| **--no-progress**     | Don't show progress - Progress percentages won't be shown.                                         |
| **--skip-powershell** | Skip PowerShell - chocolateyInstall.ps1 won't be ran.                                              |

### Default behavior

The default behavior of the `choco-install` tool is to error as the `input` property is required.

## Example usage
Below are examples of how to run `choco-install` using a `.devinit.json`.

#### .devinit.json that will install packages listed in packages.config:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "packages.config",
        }
    ]
}
```

#### .devinit.json that will install MongoDB:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "mongodb"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### .devinit.json that will install a specific version of MongoDB:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "mongodb",
            "additionalOptions": "--version 4.2.7"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### .devinit.json that adds a new feed to Chocolatey:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "packages.config",
            "additionalOptions": "-s '{feed link}'"
        }
    ]
}
```
