# devinit configuration file

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `.devinit.json` file defines the system-wide dependencies that your application needs in order to run and build. System-wide dependencies are things like Node.js, SQL Server, IIS, RabbitMQ, Docker, etc. These are the sort of things you would normally install on your dev box that aren't installed by a specific repo. It's not a place to define application-specific dependencies like you would in package managers such as NuGet or NPM. It is, however, a place to define that you need those package managers.

## File location

The `devinit init` command is driven via the `.devinit.json` file. By default, `devinit` looks for the file in the following locations:

* {current-directory}\\.devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\.devinit\\.devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\.devinit\\devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\devinit\\.devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\devinit\\devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\.devcontainer\\.devinit.json
* {current-directory}\\.devcontainer\\devinit.json

> [!NOTE]
> If multiple default files are found, then devinit will use the file that appears first in the above list.

The `.devinit.json` file can also be specified explicitly via the `--file`/`-f` option.

### Directories and relative paths

Paths are relative to the location where devinit is running. This is typically the current working directory from which `devinit` was executed.

## File Format
In a `.devinit.json`, you can specify more than one tool to run. In the `run` section, you can put any number of objects. An example of this is seen in our sample [.devinit.json](sample-all-tool.md) with all of our tools.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "comments": "string",
    "run": [
        {
            "comments": "string",
            "tool": "string",
            "input": "string|null|undefined",
            "additionalOptions": "string|null|undefined"
        }
    ]
}
```
