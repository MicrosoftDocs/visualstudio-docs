# vcpkg-install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `vcpkg-install` tool is used to acquire C/C++ libraries (referred to as ports) using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

## Usage

If both the `input` and `additionalOptions` properties are omitted or empty, then the tool will follow the [default](#default-behavior) behavior detailed below.

| Name                                             | Type   | Required | Value                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **comments**                                     | string | No       | Optional comments property. Not used.                                                   |
| [**input**](#input)                              | string | Yes      | The package(s) to install. See [Input](#input) below for details.                       |
| [**additionalOptions**](#additional-options)     | string | No       | See [Additional options](#additional-options) below for details.                        |

### Input

The `input` property should be the `name` of the `vcpkg` to install or a list of space separated names to install multiple packages. A list of available ports can be found on the [vcpkg GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports).

### Additional options

Additional options are passed directly to the [vcpkg](/powershell/module/powershellget/install-module?view=powershell-7&preserve-view=true) command and are documented on the [vcpkg GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/examples/installing-and-using-packages.md).

### Default behavior

The default behavior of the `vcpkg-install` tool is to error as `input` is required.

## Example usage
Below are examples of how to run `vcpkg-install` using a `.devinit.json`.

#### .devinit.json that will install the sdl2 port:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "vcpkg-install",
            "input": "sdl2",
        }
    ]
}
```

#### .devinit.json that will install multiple ports:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [

        {
            "tool": "vcpkg-install",
            "input": "sdl2 sqlite3"
        }
    ]
}
```
