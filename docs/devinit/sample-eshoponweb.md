# eShopOnWeb

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

This example illustrates how to customize the dotnet architecture example [eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb) to automatically be provisioned with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## PostCloneSetup.ps1

This script is called from _PostCloneSetup.ps1_ and can also be ran locally to set up the repository. This file needs to be in the same folder as _.devcontainer.json_.

```console
devinit init
dotnet ef database update -c catalogcontext -p src\Infrastructure\Infrastructure.csproj -s src\Web\Web.csproj
dotnet ef database update -c appidentitydbcontext -p src\Infrastructure\Infrastructure.csproj -s src\Web\Web.csproj
```

## .devinit.json

Contents of the [`.devinit.json`](devinit-json.md) file. This file needs to be in the same folder as _.devcontainer.json_.

```json
{
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "require-dotnetcoresdk"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-mssql"
        },
        {
            "tool": "dotnet-toolinstall",
            "input": "dotnet-ef",
            "additionalOptions": "--global"
        }
    ]
}
```

## .devcontainer.json

Contents of the _.devcontainer.json_ file in the repo root.

```json
{
  "postCreateCommand": "Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -File .\\PostCloneSetup.ps1"
}
```
