# windowsfeature-disable

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.
