# msi-install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `msi-install` tool is used to install `.msi` package file formats using [msiexec](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec).

## Usage

If the `input` is omitted or empty, then the tool will output an error.

| Name                                         | Type   | Required | Value                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **comments**                                 | string | No       | Optional comments property. Not used.                                             |
| [**input**](#input)                          | string | Yes      | The `msi` to install. See [Input](#input) below for details.                      |
| [**additionalOptions**](#additional-options) | string | No       | See [Additional options](#additional-options) below for details.                  |

### Input

The input property is used to specify a path or URL to a `.msi` file that will be installed. If the path to the `.msi` is incorrect or the URL doesn't point to a `.msi` directly, then `msi-install` will note that the installation package cannot be opened.

### Additional options

Additional configuration options can be passed in as a value of the additionalOptions. These arguments are a direct passthrough to the arguments used by `msiexec` and are defined in the `msiexec` [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec).

### Built-in options

The msi-install tool sets a number of `msiexec` command-line arguments to ensure that msi can run headless. These arguments are listed below and documentation on them can be found in the `msiexec` [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec).

| /quiet        | Specifies quiet mode with no user interaction required                                                                                                                                        |
| /qn           | Specifies there's no UI during installation process                                                                                                                                           |
| /passive      | Specifies unattended mode where the installation only shows a progress bar                                                                                                                    |
| /l*V          | Turns on logging and logs all information, including verbose information, to a `devinit.log` file in the machine's local temp folder. If the tool fails, the log file path is displayed.      |
| /norestart    | Stops the machine from restarting after the installation is complete, but will return a 3010 exit code if a reboot is needed                                                                  |

### Default behavior

The default behavior of the `msi-install` tool is to error as the `input` property is required.

## Example usage
Below is an example of how to run `msi-install` using a `.devinit.json`.

#### .devinit.json that will install the 7-Zip MSI:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-4.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "msi-install",
            "input": "https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900.msi"
        }
    ]
}
```
