# Private beta

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

This example illustrates how to customize a codespace for Visual Studio to have the same features as the initial [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) private beta.

## .devinit.json

Contents of the [`.devinit.json`](devinit-json.md) file. This file needs to be in the same folder as _.devcontainer.json_.

```json
{
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "python2"
        },
        {
            "tool": "choco-install",
            "input": "python3"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-dotnetcoresdk",
            "input": "2.1.807"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-dotnetcoresdk"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-nodejs"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-azurecli"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-nodejs"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-mssql"
        },
        {
            "tool": "dotnet-toolinstall",
            "input": "dotnet-ef",
            "additionalOptions": "--global"
        },
        {
            "tool": "require-vcpkg"
        }
    ]
}
```

## .devcontainer.json
