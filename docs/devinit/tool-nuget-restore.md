# nuget-restore

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `nuget-restore` tool restore dependencies and project-specific tools that are specified in the project file. Read more about NuGet restore [here](/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-restore).

## Usage

If both the `input` and `additionalOptions` properties are omitted or empty, then the tool will follow the [default](#default-behavior) behavior detailed below.

### Input

Path to the project/solution file to restore.

### Additional options

Additional options are passed as-is to the NuGet restore command.

### Default behavior

The default behavior of the `nuget-restore` tool is to run `NuGet restore` in the current directory.

## Example usage
Below is an example of how to run `nuget-restore` using a `.devinit.json`.

#### .devinit.json that will restore dependencies and tools of a project:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "nuget-restore",
            "input": "C:\\nuget\\Nuget.config"
        }
    ]
}
```
