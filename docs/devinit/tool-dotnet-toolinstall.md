# dotnet-toolinstall

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of April 12th 2021, connecting to GitHub Codespaces from Visual Studio 2019 will no longer be supported and this private preview has concluded. Weâ€™re focused on evolving experiences for a cloud-powered inner loop and VDI solutions optimized for a broad set of Visual Studio workloads. As part of this `devinit` and associated tools will no longer be available. We encourage you to be involved in our developer community forum for Visual Studio for information on future previews and roadmap information.

The `dotnet-toolinstall` tool is used to install the [.NET Core Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) via the `dotnet tool update` command.

## Usage

If both the `input` and `additionalOptions` properties are omitted or empty, then the tool will follow the [default](#default-behavior) behavior detailed below.

| Name                                             | Type   | Required | Value                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **comments**                                     | string | No       | Optional comments property. Not used.                                 |
| [**input**](#input)                              | string | Yes      | The .NET Core tool to install. See [Input](#input) below for details. |
| [**additionalOptions**](#additional-options)     | string | No       | See [Additional options](#additional-options) below for details.      |

### Input

The `input` property is used to specify the .NET Core tool to install. There is in an unofficial list of tools at [https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-tools](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-tools).

### Additional options

Additional configuration options can be passed in as a value of the `additionalOptions`. These arguments are a direct passthrough to the arguments used by the [`dotnet tool update`](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#update-a-tool) command.

The `dotnet tool update` command is used to safely handle the case where a tool is already installed.

### Default behavior

The default behavior of the `dotnet-toolinstall` tool is to error as `input` is required.

## Example usage
Below are examples of how to run `dotnet-toolinstall` using a `.devinit.json`.

#### .devinit.json that will install the dotnet-trace tool:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "dotnet-toolinstall",
            "input": "dotnet-trace"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### .devinit.json that will install the dotnet-trace tool as a global tool:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/devinit.schema-3.0",
    "run": [
        {
            "tool": "dotnet-toolinstall",
            "input": "dotnet-trace",
            "additionalOptions": "--global"
        }
    ]
}
```
