# Stage lines of code in Visual Studio

:::moniker range="visualstudio"
Line-staging support, also known as [interactive staging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging) lets you stage chunks of changes in your files right from the code editor. Line staging can also be helpful when you want to split changes across different commits.

:::moniker range="vs-2022"
Line-staging support, also known as [interactive staging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging), is available in Visual Studio 2022 [version 17.3](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.3) and later. Line-staging lets you stage chunks of changes in your files right from the code editor. Line staging can also be helpful when you want to split changes across different commits.

You can use the hover option to also *unstage* changes, line by line.

## Observe staged changes with color margins

The first thing you might notice about line-staging support is how the editor visualizes Git changes in the scroll bar and also in the margin.

The colors and annotations make it easy to differentiate between saved and unsaved changes that you added, deleted, or modified.

### Configure color margin settings

:::moniker range="vs-2022"
You can change the colors that Visual Studio displays to help you manage changes. In the **Tools** > **Options** dialog, go to the **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors** section, and configure the following **Display items** options:

You can change the colors that Visual Studio displays to help you manage changes. In the **Tools** > **Options** page, search for **Fonts and Colors**, and configure the following **Display items** options:

## View staged changes with Peek Difference 

Color margins are interactive. When you select a color margin, Visual Studio opens the **Peek Difference** user interface (UI) where you can view your changes in the editor without switching context. The Peek Difference UI summarizes the number of added and removed lines and makes it easy to switch between changes by using the Up and Down arrows.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/git-peek-difference.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Peek Difference user interface in Visual Studio as it relates to source control." lightbox="media/vs-2022/git-peek-difference.png":::

You can also access Peek Difference when you right-click a line of code that has changes. You can select **Peek Difference** from the context menu or use the **Alt**+**F8** keyboard shortcut.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer an inline difference view, you can use the **Settings** control in the top-right corner of the **Diff** editor to switch to **Inline mode**.

### Configure Peek Difference settings

You can modify how Visual Studio interacts with code changes in the Peek Difference UI. The **Click to peek in margin** option is available on the **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **Advanced** page.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/text-editor-option-peek-in-margin.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Click to peek in margin' Text Editor setting.":::

You can change the default **Single click** setting to **Double click**, or you can select **None** to turn off the Peek Difference UI.

## Stage chunks of code

You can stage any chunk of code by using the Peek Difference UI. Hover over the change to stage and select **Stage Change**. If you want to stage *all* the changes you made to a document, you can use the global **Stage** action.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/git-stage-change.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Stage Change option in Visual Studio 2022." lightbox="media/vs-2022/git-stage-change.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer a full-screen difference view, you can switch to the **Diff** editor with the **Promote to Document** :::image type="icon" source="media/vs-2022/promote-document-button.png" border="false"::: icon at the top-right of the [**Peek Difference** UI](#view-staged-changes-with-peek-difference), or use the **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Home** keyboard shortcut. All features provided by the Peek Difference UI are also available in the **Diff** editor. The following image shows the **Diff** editor view:

You can enable or disable the staging controls in the difference view by clicking the **Show staging controls** button.

## Commit staged changes

After you prepare your commit by reviewing and staging the desired changes, you can create your commit by using the **Git Changes** window. Enter a commit message and select **Commit Staged** to complete the process:
