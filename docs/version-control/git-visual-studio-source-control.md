# How Visual Studio makes source control easy

Have you ever wished you could go back to a previously working version of your code? Do you find yourself manually storing copies of your code in different locations as a backup? Source control makes it possible to track changes you make to your code over time so you can both track your progress and revert to specific versions. Visual Studio makes it easy to work with Git, which is the most widely used modern version control system.

## A great place to start with Git & GitHub

GitHub offers free and secured cloud code storage where you can store your code and access it from any device, anywhere. Visual Studio comes with first-class Git and GitHub functionality that makes it easy to use source control to manage your code and collaborate with others. Get started by adding your code to Git & GitHub with the following **Create a Git repository** dialog box. To do so, choose **Git** > **Create a Git repository** from the menu bar.

You can also use GitHub to explore and learn from a large number of open-source repositories. Visual Studio makes it easy to clone and browse existing GitHub repositories, so itâ€™s a great learning environment.

## Streamlined and intuitive inner-loop Git experience

Visual Studio provides discoverable and intuitive Git features focused on maximizing the productivity of your daily workflow (inner loop). You no longer need to move away from your code to commit your changes. These features include a top-level Git menu, a Git Changes window, and a Git focused Status bar. Git integrates with Visual Studio as a holistic experience; for example, both Solution Explorer and the Code Editor have a first-class Git integration.

## First-class repository management & collaboration

Visual Studio includes powerful repository browsing and collaboration features that eliminate the need to use other tools. Stay up to date with your repository by keeping an eye on your incoming/outgoing commits, previewing branches, and comparing commits. And, manage your repository by managing your branches and squashing and cherry-picking commits.

## Interactive & smart Git functionality

Git integration in Visual Studio promotes trust and confidence by providing contextual assistance and prompting you to do the right thing. It also includes a conflict resolution experience that can show/hide word differences and navigate between conflicts and differences.
