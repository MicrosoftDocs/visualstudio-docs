# Create a GitHub account to use with Visual Studio

With a GitHub account, you get [full GitHub support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/github/) from within the [Visual Studio IDE](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md) to both manage your code and collaborate with others on development projects.

If you don't already have a GitHub account, here's how to create one.

1. Open [https://github.com](https://github.com) in a web browser, and then select **Sign up**.

1. **Enter your email** address.

1. **Create a password** for your new GitHub account, and **Enter a username**, too. Next, choose whether you want to receive updates and announcements via email, and then select **Continue**.

1. **Verify your account** by solving a puzzle. Select the **Start Puzzle** button to do so, and then follow the prompts.

1. After you verify your account, select the **Create account** button.

1. Next, GitHub sends a launch code to your email address. Type that launch code in the **Enter code** dialog, and then press **Enter**.

1. GitHub asks you some questions to help tailor your experience. Choose the answers that apply to you in the following dialogs:

   - **How many team members will be working with you?**
   - **What specific features are you interested in using?**

1. On the **Where teams collaborate and ship** screen, you can choose whether you want to use the Free account or the Team account. To choose the **Free** account, select the **Skip personalization** button.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always upgrade your account later. See the [**Types of GitHub accounts**](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts) page to learn more.

    GitHub opens a personalized page in your browser.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your GitHub account.
