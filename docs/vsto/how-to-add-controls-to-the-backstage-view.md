# How to: Add controls to the Backstage view
  You can use the Ribbon Designer to add controls to the menu that opens when you click the **File** tab. When you run the application, controls that you add to the **File** tab appear a group named **Add-ins**.

 You cannot position controls before or after built-in controls by using the Ribbon designer in Visual Studio. A built-in control is a control that already appears in Backstage view. If you want to position controls before or after built-in controls, you must use a Ribbon XML. For more information about **Ribbon (XML)**, see [Ribbon XML](../vsto/ribbon-xml.md). For more information about customizing the Backstage view, see [Introduction to the Office 2010 Backstage view for developers](/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2010/ee691833(v=office.14)) and [Customize the Office 2010 Backstage view for developers](/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2010/ee815851(v=office.14)).

### To add controls to Backstage view

1. Open the Ribbon item in Design view.

     For information about how to add a **Ribbon (Visual Designer)** item to your project, see [How to: Get started customizing the Ribbon](../vsto/how-to-get-started-customizing-the-ribbon.md).

2. In the Ribbon Designer, click the **File** tab.

     A menu designer appears. This design surface does not contain any controls.

3. From the **Office Ribbon Controls** tab of the **Toolbox**, drag any of the following controls onto the menu designer:

    - Button

    - CheckBox

    - Gallery

    - Menu

    - Separator

    - SplitButton

    - ToggleButton

4. Drag controls to move them to new positions on the menu.
