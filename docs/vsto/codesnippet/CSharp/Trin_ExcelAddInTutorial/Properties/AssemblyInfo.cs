// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible 
// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from 
// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// 
// The ExcelLocale1033 attribute controls the locale that is passed to the Excel
// object model. Setting ExcelLocale1033 to true causes the Excel object model to 
// act the same in all locales, which matches the behavior of Visual Basic for 
// Applications. Setting ExcelLocale1033 to false causes the Excel object model to
// act differently when users have different locale settings, which matches the 
// behavior of Visual Studio Tools for Office, Version 2003. This can cause unexpected 
// results in locale-sensitive information such as formula names and date formats.
