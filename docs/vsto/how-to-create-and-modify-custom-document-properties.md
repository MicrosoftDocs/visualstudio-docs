# How to: Create and modify custom document properties
  The Microsoft Office applications listed above provide built-in properties that are stored with documents. In addition, you can create and modify custom document properties if there is additional information you want to store with the document.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_docprops](../vsto/includes/appliesto-docprops-md.md)]

 Use the CustomDocumentProperties property of a document to work with custom properties. For example, in a document-level project for Microsoft Office Excel, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook.CustomDocumentProperties%2A> property of the `ThisWorkbook` class. In a VSTO Add-in project for Excel, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Workbook.CustomDocumentProperties%2A> property of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook> object. These properties return a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperties> object, which is a collection of <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.DocumentProperty> objects. You can use the `Item` property of the collection to retrieve a particular property, either by name or by index within the collection.

 The following example demonstrates how to add a custom property in a document-level customization for Excel and assign it a value.

## Example
 [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#6](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelVB/ThisWorkbook.vb#6)]
 [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreProgramming#6](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreProgrammingExcelCS/ThisWorkbook.cs#6)]

## Robust programming
 Attempting to access the `Value` property for undefined properties raises an exception.
