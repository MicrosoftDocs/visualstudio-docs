# How to: Programmatically cache a data source in an Office document
  You can programmatically add a data object to the data cache in a document by calling the `StartCaching` method of a host item, such as a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.Document>, <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook>, or <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet>. Remove a data object from the data cache by calling the `StopCaching` method of a host item.

 The `StartCaching` method and the `StopCaching` method are both private, but they appear in IntelliSense.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_alldoc](../vsto/includes/appliesto-alldoc-md.md)]

 When you use the `StartCaching` method to add a data object to the data cache, the data object does not need to be declared with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Runtime.CachedAttribute> attribute. However, the data object must meet certain requirements to be added to the data cache. For more information, see [Cache data](../vsto/caching-data.md).

## To programmatically cache a data object

1. Declare the data object at the class level, not inside a method. This example assumes that you are declaring a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> named `dataSet1` that you want to cache programmatically.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#12](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelCS/Sheet1.cs#12)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#12](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelVB/Sheet1.vb#12)]

2. Instantiate the data object, and then call the `StartCaching` method of the document or worksheet instance and pass in the name of the data object.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#13](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelCS/Sheet1.cs#13)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#13](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelVB/Sheet1.vb#13)]

## To stop caching a data object

1. Call the `StopCaching` method of the document or worksheet instance and pass in the name of the data object. This example assumes that you have a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> named `dataSet1` that you want to stop caching.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#14](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelCS/Sheet1.cs#14)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreDataExcel#14](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreDataExcelVB/Sheet1.vb#14)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not call `StopCaching` from the event handler for the `Shutdown` event of a document or worksheet. By the time the `Shutdown` event is raised, it is too late to modify the data cache. For more information about the `Shutdown` event, see [Events in Office Projects](../vsto/events-in-office-projects.md).
