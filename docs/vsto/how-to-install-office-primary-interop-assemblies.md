# How to: Install Office primary interop assemblies
  Install the Microsoft Office primary interop assemblies (PIAs) when you install Office.

[!include[Add-ins note](includes/addinsnote.md)]

## To install the PIAs when you install Office

1. Ensure that you have a version of the .NET Framework that is no older than 2.0.

2. Install Microsoft Office and make sure that the **.NET Programmability Support** feature is selected for the applications you want to extend (this feature is included in the default installation).

    > [!WARNING]
    > By default, PIA's are embedded in your solution when you build it so you don't have to distribute PIAs to users as a prerequisite to using your VSTO Add-in or customization.
