# Customize a Ribbon for InfoPath
  When you customize the Ribbon in Microsoft Office InfoPath, you must consider where your custom Ribbon will appear in the application. [!INCLUDE[InfoPath_14_short](../vsto/includes/infopath-14-short-md.md)] can display the Ribbon in the following three types of InfoPath application windows:

- Windows that display a form template that is opened in design mode.

- Windows that display a form that is based on a form template.

- The Print Preview window.

  **Applies to:** The information in this topic applies to VSTO Add-in projects for InfoPath 2010. For more information, see [Features available by Office application and project type](../vsto/features-available-by-office-application-and-project-type.md).

  Users and designers open a form template in design mode to modify the appearance and layout of the template. Users open forms that are based in a form template to add content.

  The Print Preview window enables designers and users to preview the pages of a form or form template before they print them.

> [!NOTE]
> The **AddIns** tab does not appear in the Print Preview window. If you want a custom tab to appear in the Print Preview window, make sure that the **OfficeId** property of the tab is not set to **TabAddIns**.

 You must specify the Ribbon type of each window in which you want your Ribbon to appear.

## Specify the Ribbon type in the Ribbon designer
 If you are using the **Ribbon (Visual Designer)** item, click the **RibbonType** property of the Ribbon in the **Properties** window, and then select any of the Ribbon IDs described in the following table.

|Ribbon ID|Window in which the Ribbon will appear when you run the project|
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Microsoft.InfoPath.Designer**|Windows that display a form template that is opened in design mode.|
|**Microsoft.InfoPath.Editor**|Windows that display a form that is based on a form template.|
|**Microsoft.InfoPath.PrintPreview**|The Print Preview window.|

 You can add more than one Ribbon to a project. If more than one Ribbon share a Ribbon ID, override the `CreateRibbonExtensibilityObject` method in the `ThisAddin` class of your project to specify which Ribbon to display at run time. For more information, see [Ribbon overview](../vsto/ribbon-overview.md).

## Specify the Ribbon type by using Ribbon XML
 If you are using the **Ribbon (XML)** item, check the value of the *ribbonID* parameter in the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.IRibbonExtensibility.GetCustomUI%2A> method and return the appropriate Ribbon.

 The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Core.IRibbonExtensibility.GetCustomUI%2A> method is automatically generated by Visual Studio in the Ribbon code file. The *ribbonID* parameter is a string that identifies the type of InfoPath window that is opening.

 The following code example demonstrates how to display a custom Ribbon only in a window that displays a form template in design mode. The Ribbon to display is specified in the `GetResourceText()` method, which is generated in the Ribbon class. For more information about the Ribbon class, see [Ribbon XML](../vsto/ribbon-xml.md).
