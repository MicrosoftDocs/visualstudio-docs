# Office Development Samples and Walkthroughs
  This section contains sample applications, example code, and step-by-step walkthroughs that illustrate the syntax, structure, and techniques used to build Microsoft Office solutions.  
  
 The sample code is intended for instructional purposes, and should not be used in deployed solutions without modifications. In particular, security must be taken into greater consideration.  
  
 For information about securing applications, see [Securing Office Solutions](../vsto/securing-office-solutions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.
