# Office development samples and walkthroughs

  This section contains sample applications, example code, and step-by-step walkthroughs that illustrate the syntax, structure, and techniques used to build Microsoft Office solutions.

 The sample code is intended for instructional purposes, and should not be used in deployed solutions without modifications. In particular, security must be taken into greater consideration.

 For information about securing applications, see [Secure Office solutions](../vsto/securing-office-solutions.md).
