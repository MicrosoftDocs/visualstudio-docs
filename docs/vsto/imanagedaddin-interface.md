# IManagedAddin interface
  Implement the IManagedAddin interface to create a component that loads managed VSTO Add-ins. This interface was added in the 2007 Microsoft Office system.

## Syntax

```csharp
[
    object,
    uuid(B9CEAB65-331C-4713-8410-DDDAF8EC191A),
    pointer_default(unique),
    oleautomation
]
interface IManagedAddin : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT Load(
        [in] BSTR bstrManifestURL,
        [in] IDispatch *pdispApplication);
    HRESULT Unload();
};
```

## Methods
 The following table lists the methods that are defined by the IManagedAddin interface.

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[IManagedAddin::Load](../vsto/imanagedaddin-load.md)|Called when a Microsoft Office application loads a managed VSTO Add-in.|
|[IManagedAddin::Unload](../vsto/imanagedaddin-unload.md)|Called just before a Microsoft Office application unloads a managed VSTO Add-in.|

## Remarks
 Microsoft Office applications, starting with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, use the IManagedAddin interface to help load Office VSTO Add-ins. You can implement the IManagedAddin interface to create your own VSTO Add-in loader and runtime for managed VSTO Add-ins, instead of using the VSTO Add-in loader (*VSTOLoader.dll*) and [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)]. For more information, see [Architecture of VSTO Add-ins](../vsto/architecture-of-vsto-add-ins.md).

## How managed Add-ins are loaded
 The following steps occur when an application starts:

1. The application discovers VSTO Add-ins by looking for entries under the following registry key:

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\*\<application name>*\Addins\\**

    Each entry under this registry key is a unique ID of the VSTO Add-in. Typically, this is the name of the VSTO Add-in assembly.

2. The application looks for a `Manifest` entry under the entry for each VSTO Add-in.

    Managed VSTO Add-ins can store the full path of a manifest in the `Manifest` entry under **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\_\<application name>_\Addins\\_\<add-in ID>_**. A manifest is a file (typically, an XML file) that provides information that is used to help load the VSTO Add-in.

3. If the application finds a `Manifest` entry, the application tries to load a managed VSTO Add-in loader component. The application does this by trying to create a COM object that implements the IManagedAddin interface.

    The [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)] includes a VSTO Add-in loader component (*VSTOLoader.dll*), or you can create your own by implementing the IManagedAddin interface.

4. The application calls the [IManagedAddin::Load](../vsto/imanagedaddin-load.md) method and passes in the value of the `Manifest` entry.

5. The [IManagedAddin::Load](../vsto/imanagedaddin-load.md) method performs tasks required to load the VSTO Add-in, such as configuring the application domain and security policy for the VSTO Add-in that is being loaded.

   For more information about the registry keys that Microsoft Office applications use to discover and load managed VSTO Add-ins, see [Registry entries for VSTO Add-ins](../vsto/registry-entries-for-vsto-add-ins.md).

## Guidance to implement IManagedAddin
 If you implement IManagedAddin, you must register the DLL that contains the implementation by using the following CLSID:

 99D651D7-5F7C-470E-8A3B-774D5D9536AC

 Microsoft Office applications use this CLSID to create the COM object that implements IManagedAddin.

> [!CAUTION]
> This CLSID is also used by *VSTOLoader.dll* in the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)]. Therefore, if you use IManagedAddin to create your own VSTO Add-in loader and runtime component, you cannot deploy your component to computers that are running VSTO Add-ins that rely on the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)].
