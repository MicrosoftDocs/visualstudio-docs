# Getting Started (Office Development in Visual Studio)
  This section contains topics that help you get started using the Microsoft Office developer tools in Visual Studio.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.
