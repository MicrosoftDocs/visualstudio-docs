# How to: Programmatically create new workbooks
  When you create a workbook programmatically, it is a native <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook> object, not a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook> host item.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

 You can generate a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook> host item for a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook> object in VSTO Add-in project. For more information, see [Extend Word documents and Excel workbooks in VSTO Add-ins at run time](../vsto/extending-word-documents-and-excel-workbooks-in-vsto-add-ins-at-run-time.md).

## To create a new workbook

1. Use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks.Add%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks> collection.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#1)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can create a workbook based on a template other than the default template: pass the template you want to use as a parameter to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks.Add%2A> method.
