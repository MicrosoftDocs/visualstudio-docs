# Additional resources to develop Office solutions
  The Microsoft Office developer tools in Visual Studio represent just one of many ways to extend Office applications. Office applications also have some built-in features, such as the Open XML Formats, that are not covered by the Office developer tools in Visual Studio or this documentation.

 If you want to learn more about the possibilities offered by Microsoft Office and the Office developer tools in Visual Studio, these resources will get you started.

[Office developer center](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/docs)

The central portal to the latest resources for Office developers (not specific to Office development using Visual Studio).

[Microsoft Office development section of the MSDN Library](/previous-versions/office/office-12/bb726434(v=office.12))

The area of the MSDN Library where you can find articles and reference documentation about developing solutions for several versions of Office (not specific to Office development using Visual Studio).
