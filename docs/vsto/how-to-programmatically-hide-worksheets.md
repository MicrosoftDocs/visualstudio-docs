# How to: Programmatically hide worksheets
  You can show or hide any worksheet in a workbook. To hide a worksheet, use the worksheet host item or access the worksheet by using the sheets collection of the workbook.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Use the worksheet host item
 If the worksheet was added at design-time in a document-level customization, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Visible%2A> property to hide the specified worksheet.

### To hide a worksheet using a worksheet host item

1. Set the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Visible%2A> property of the `Sheet1` host item to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetHidden> enumeration value.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#25](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#25)]

## Use the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook
 Access worksheets through the Microsoft Office Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection in the following cases:

- You want to hide a worksheet in a VSTO Add-in.

- The worksheet that you want to hide was created at run time in a document-level customization.

### To hide a worksheet using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook

1. Set the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Worksheets.Visible%2A> property of the worksheet to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlSheetVisibility.xlSheetHidden> enumeration value.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#26](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#26)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#26](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#26)]
