# How to: Add Chart controls to worksheets
  You can add <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> controls to a Microsoft Office Excel worksheet at design time and at run time in document-level customizations. You can also add <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> controls at run time in VSTO Add-ins.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

 This topic describes the following tasks:

- [Add Chart controls at design time](#designtime)

- [Add Chart controls at run time in a document-level project](#runtimedoclevel)

- [Add Chart controls at run time in a VSTO Add-in project](#runtimeaddin)

  For more information about <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> controls, see [Chart control](../vsto/chart-control.md).

## <a name="designtime"></a> Add Chart controls at design time
 You can add the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control to your worksheet in the same manner you would add a chart from within the application.

> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control is not available from the **Toolbox** or the **Data Sources** window.

### To add a Chart host control to a worksheet in Excel

1. On the **Insert** tab, in the **Charts** group, click **Column**, click a category of charts, and then click the type of chart you want.

2. In the **Insert Chart** dialog box, click **OK**.

3. On the **Design** tab, in the **Data** group, click **Select Data**.

4. In the **Select Data Source** dialog box, click in the **Chart** **data range** box and clear any default selection.

5. In the **Data for Chart** sheet, select the range of cells that contains the data for the chart (cells **A5** through **D8**).

6. In the **Select Data Source** dialog box, click **OK**.

## <a name="runtimedoclevel"></a> Add chart controls at run time in a document-level project
 You can add the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control dynamically at run time. Dynamically created charts are not persisted in the document as host controls when the document is closed. For more information, see [Add controls to Office documents at run time](../vsto/adding-controls-to-office-documents-at-run-time.md).

#### To add a Chart control to a worksheet programmatically

1. In the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Startup> event handler of `Sheet1`, insert the following code to add the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreHostControlsExcel#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreHostControlsExcelCS/Sheet1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreHostControlsExcel#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreHostControlsExcelVB/Sheet1.vb#1)]

## <a name="runtimeaddin"></a> Add chart controls at run time in a VSTO Add-in project
 You can add a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control programmatically to any open worksheet in a VSTO Add-in project. For more information, see [Extend Word documents and Excel workbooks in VSTO Add-ins at run time](../vsto/extending-word-documents-and-excel-workbooks-in-vsto-add-ins-at-run-time.md).

 Dynamically created chart controls are not persisted in the worksheet as host controls when the worksheet is closed. For more information, see [Add Controls to Office documents at run time](../vsto/adding-controls-to-office-documents-at-run-time.md).

#### To add a Chart control to a worksheet programmatically

1. The following code generates a worksheet host item that is based on the open worksheet, and then adds a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Chart> control.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_Excel_Dynamic_Controls#9](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_Excel_Dynamic_Controls/ThisAddIn.cs#9)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_Excel_Dynamic_Controls#9](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_Excel_Dynamic_Controls/ThisAddIn.vb#9)]

## Compile the code
 This example has the following requirements:

- Data to be charted, stored in the range from A5 to D8 in the worksheet.
