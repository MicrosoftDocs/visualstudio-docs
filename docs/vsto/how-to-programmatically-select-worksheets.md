# How to: Programmatically select worksheets
  The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Select%2A> method selects the specified object, which moves the user's selection to the new object. Use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Activate%2A> method if you want to bring focus to the object without changing the user's selection.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

 If you want to select an existing worksheet in a VSTO Add-in or if the worksheet was created at run time in a document-level customization, you must access it by using the Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection of the Excel workbook; otherwise, you can access the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet> host item directly.

## Use the worksheet host item
 In a document-level customization, add the following code to *Sheet1.vb* or *Sheet1.cs*.

### To select the first worksheet in a workbook using a host item

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Select%2A> method of `Sheet1`.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#19](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#19)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#19](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#19)]

## Use the sheets collection of the Excel workbook
 Access the worksheet by using the Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection.

### To select the first worksheet in a workbook using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets.Select%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection to select the first worksheet of the active workbook.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#20](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#20)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#20](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#20)]
