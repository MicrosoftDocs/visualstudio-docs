# How to: Programmatically send email
  This example sends an email message to contacts that have the domain name **example.com** in their email addresses.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_olkallapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-olkallapp-md.md)]

[!include[Add-ins note](includes/addinsnote.md)]

## Example
 [!code-csharp[Trin_OL_ProgramEmail#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_OL_ProgramEMail/thisaddin.cs#1)]

## Compile the code
 This example requires:

- Contacts that have the domain name **example.com** in their email addresses.

## Robust programming
 Do not remove the filter code that searches for the domain name **example.com**. Your solution will send email messages to all of your contacts if you remove the filter.
