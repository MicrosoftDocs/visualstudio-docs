 For more information about Excel tasks and the Excel object model, see [Excel Object Model Overview](../vsto/excel-object-model-overview.md).  
  
 In some cases, the ways that you perform these tasks in VSTO Add-ins is different from the ways that you perform them in document-level customizations.
