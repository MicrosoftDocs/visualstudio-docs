# Create VSTO Add-ins for Office by using Visual Studio
  You can use the Microsoft Office developer tools in Visual Studio to create .NET Framework applications that extend Office. These applications are also named *Office solutions*.

 The Office developer tools provide features that help you create Office solutions to suit a variety of business needs. The tools include project templates to help you create Office solutions by using Visual Basic or Visual C#, and visual designers that help you create custom user interfaces for your Office solutions.
