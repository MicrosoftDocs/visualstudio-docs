# How AutoSave impacts Office solutions

AutoSave is a feature for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word that automatically and continuously saves your edits. If the feature is turned off, you must save files manually to keep your changes. You may need to adjust your Office solution so that it works smoothly even while AutoSave is on. For details, see [How AutoSave impacts add-ins and macros](/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/how-autosave-impacts-addins-and-macros). For more information about AutoSave in general, see [What is AutoSave?](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5).

> [!NOTE]
> AutoSave for Windows Desktop Word, Excel, and PowerPoint was introduced in 2017 and is currently available for Office365 subscribers. If you bought a perpetual license to Office 2016 or earlier, you don't currently have access to the coauthoring feature. (Excel Online, Excel for Android, Excel for iOS, and Excel Mobile in the Windows Store do support this feature, though.)
