# How to: Programmatically use Word dialog boxes in hidden mode
  You can perform complex operations with one method call by invoking the built-in dialog boxes in Microsoft Office Word without displaying them to the user. You can do this by using the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Dialog.Execute%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Dialog> object without calling the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Dialog.Display%2A> method.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_wdalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-wdalldocapp-md.md)]

## Examples
 The following code examples demonstrate how to use the **Page Setup** dialog box in hidden mode to set multiple page setup properties with no user input. The examples use a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Dialog> object to configure a custom page size. The specific settings for page setup, such as the top margin, bottom margin, and so on, are available as late-bound properties of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Dialog> object. These properties are dynamically created by Word at run time.

 The following example demonstrates how to perform this task in Visual Basic projects where **Option Strict** is off and in Visual C# projects that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../sharepoint/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)]. In these projects, you can use late binding features in the Visual Basic and Visual C# compilers. To use this example, run it from the `ThisDocument` or `ThisAddIn` class in your project.

 [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreWordAutomation#123](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreWordAutomationCS/ThisDocument.cs#123)]

 The following example demonstrates how to perform this task in Visual Basic projects where **Option Strict** is on. In these projects, you must use reflection to access the late-bound properties. To use this example, run it from the `ThisDocument` or `ThisAddIn` class in your project.
