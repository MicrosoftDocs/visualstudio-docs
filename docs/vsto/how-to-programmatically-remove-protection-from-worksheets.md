# How to: Programmatically remove protection from worksheets
  You can programmatically remove protection from a Microsoft Office Excel worksheet.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

 The following example uses the variable `getPasswordFromUser`, which contains a password obtained from the user.

## To unprotect a worksheet in a document-level customization

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Unprotect%2A> method of the worksheet and pass in the password, if necessary. This example assumes that you are working with a worksheet named `Sheet1`.

## To unprotect a worksheet in a VSTO Add-in

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Worksheet.Unprotect%2A> method of the active worksheet and pass in the password, if necessary.
