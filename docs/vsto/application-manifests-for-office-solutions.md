# Application manifests for Office solutions
  An application manifest is an XML file that describes the assemblies that are loaded into a Microsoft Office solution. The Microsoft Office development tools in Visual Studio use the [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../vsto/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application manifest schema defined in the [ClickOnce application manifest](../deployment/clickonce-application-manifest.md) reference.

 Application manifests for Office solutions use the following [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../vsto/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] elements and attributes.

|Element|Description|Attributes|
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
|[&#60;assembly&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/assembly-element-clickonce-deployment.md)|Required. Top-level element.|**manifestVersion**|
|[&#60;assemblyIdentity&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/assemblyidentity-element-clickonce-deployment.md)|Required. Identifies the [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../vsto/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application's primary assembly.|**name**<br /><br /> **version**<br /><br /> **publicKeyToken**<br /><br /> **processorArchitecture**<br /><br /> **language**|
|[&#60;trustInfo&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/trustinfo-element-clickonce-application.md)|Identifies the application security requirements.|None|
|[&#60;entryPoint&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/entrypoint-element-clickonce-application.md)|Required. Identifies the application code entry point for execution.|**name**<br /><br /> **dependencyName**<br /><br /> **customHostSpecified**|
|[&#60;dependency&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/dependency-element-clickonce-deployment.md)|Required. Identifies each dependency required for the application to run. Optionally identifies assemblies that need to be preinstalled.|None|
|[&#60;file&#62; Element &#40;ClickOnce Application&#41;](../deployment/file-element-clickonce-application.md)|Required. Identifies each non-assembly file that is used by the application. Can include Component Object Model (COM) isolation data associated with the file.|**name**<br /><br /> **size**|

 Application manifests for Office solutions have the following element in the `co.v1` namespace.

```xml
<entryPoint>
    <co.v1:customHostSpecified />
</entryPoint>
```

 These application manifests also have the following elements and attributes in the `vstav3` namespace.

```xml
<addIn>
  <entryPointsCollection>
    <entryPoints>
      <entryPoint>
      </entryPoint>
    </entryPoints>
  </entryPointsCollection>
  <update></update>
  <postActions>
    <postAction>
      <postActionData>
      </postActionData>
    <postAction>
  </postActions>
  <application>
    <customizations>
      <customization>
      </customization>
    </customizations>
  </application
</addIn>
```

## Remarks
 You can manually edit application and deployment manifests in Office solutions. Afterwards, you must re-sign the application and deployment manifests by using the Manifest Generation and Editing Tool (*mage.exe* and *mageui.exe*). For more information, see [How to: Re-sign application and deployment manifests](../deployment/how-to-re-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests.md).

## File location
 An application manifest is specific to a single version of a solution. For this reason, application manifests should be stored separately from deployment manifests. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] places the version-specific files in a subdirectory named after the associated version in the *Application Files* subdirectory in the publish folder.

## File name syntax
 The name of an application manifest file should be the full name and extension of the application as identified in the **assemblyIdentity** element, followed by the extension *.manifest*. For example, an application manifest that refers to the *OutlookAddIn1.dll* customization would use the following file name syntax.

 `OutlookAddIn1.dll.manifest`
