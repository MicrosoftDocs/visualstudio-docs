# How to: Customize a built-in tab
  You can add groups and controls to a built-in tab. A built-in tab is a tab that's already on the Ribbon of a Microsoft Office application. For example, the **Data** tab is a built-in tab in Excel. When you create a custom group, it appears last on the tab, but you can move your group anywhere on the tab.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_ribbon](../vsto/includes/appliesto-ribbon-md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> You can add groups to a built-in tab, but you cannot remove built-in groups from a built-in tab.

### To add groups to a built-in tab

1. Right-click the Ribbon code file in **Solution Explorer**, and then click **View Designer**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the Ribbon code file doesn't appear in **Solution Explorer**, you must add a **Ribbon item** to your project. See [How to: Get started customizing the ribbon](../vsto/how-to-get-started-customizing-the-ribbon.md).

2. Right-click any tab in the Ribbon designer, and then click **Properties**.

3. In the **Properties** window, expand the **ControlId** property, and then set the **ControlIdType** property to **Office**.

4. Set the **OfficeId** property to the *control ID* of the built-in tab that you want to customize.

     The control ID is the name that uniquely identifies tabs, groups, and controls that are built into Microsoft Office applications.

     For a list of control IDs, see [Office 2010 help files: Office fluent user interface control identifiers](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=6627).

5. From the **Office Ribbon Controls** tab of the **Toolbox**, drag groups onto the tab.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Built-in groups do not appear in the designer. Therefore, the only way to determine whether you are working with a built-in tab is to examine the **ControlId** property of the tab.

### To position groups on a built-in tab

1. In the Ribbon Designer, select a custom group.

2. In the **Properties** window, expand the **Position** property.

3. Set the **PositionType** property to the appropriate value:

    - **BeforeOfficeId** positions the group before a specified built-in group.

    - **AfterOfficeId** positions the group after a specified built-in group.

4. Set the **OfficeId** property to the control ID of a built-in group.

     For a list of control IDs, see [Office 2010 help files: Office fluent user interface control identifiers](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=6627).
