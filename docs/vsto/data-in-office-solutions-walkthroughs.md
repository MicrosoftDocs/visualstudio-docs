# Data in Office Solutions Walkthroughs
  The following walkthroughs demonstrate how to work with data in document-level customizations and VSTO Add-ins for Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office Excel.  
  
## Binding Controls to Data  
 [Walkthrough: Simple Data Binding in a Document-Level Project](../vsto/walkthrough-simple-data-binding-in-a-document-level-project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind a single data field in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> in a document-level customization for Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Complex Data Binding in a Document-Level Project](../vsto/walkthrough-complex-data-binding-in-a-document-level-project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind a table in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> in a document-level customization for Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Simple Data Binding in VSTO add-in Project](../vsto/walkthrough-simple-data-binding-in-vsto-add-in-project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind a single data field in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.RichTextContentControl> in an VSTO Add-in for Word.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Complex Data Binding in VSTO add-in Project](../vsto/walkthrough-complex-data-binding-in-vsto-add-in-project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind a table in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> in an VSTO Add-in for Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Binding Data to Controls on an Excel Actions Pane](../vsto/walkthrough-binding-data-to-controls-on-an-excel-actions-pane.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add controls that are bound to a data source to an actions pane in Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Binding Data to Controls on a Word Actions Pane](../vsto/walkthrough-binding-data-to-controls-on-a-word-actions-pane.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind controls on an actions pane to data. The controls demonstrate a master/detail relation between tables in a SQL Server database.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Binding Content Controls to Custom XML Parts](../vsto/walkthrough-binding-content-controls-to-custom-xml-parts.md)  
 Demonstrates how to bind content controls in a Word document to XML data that is stored in the document.  
  
## Caching Data in Document-Level Solutions  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Master Detail Relation Using a Cached Dataset](../vsto/walkthrough-creating-a-master-detail-relation-using-a-cached-dataset.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a master/detail relation on a worksheet, and cache the data so that the solution can be used offline.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Inserting Data into a Workbook on a Server](../vsto/walkthrough-inserting-data-into-a-workbook-on-a-server.md)  
 Demonstrates how to insert data into a dataset that is cached in a Microsoft Office Excel workbook without starting Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Retrieving Cached Data from a Workbook on a Server](../vsto/walkthrough-retrieving-cached-data-from-a-workbook-on-a-server.md)  
 Demonstrates how to retrieve data from a dataset that is cached in a Microsoft Office Excel workbook without starting Excel.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Changing Cached Data in a Workbook on a Server](../vsto/walkthrough-changing-cached-data-in-a-workbook-on-a-server.md)  
 Demonstrates how to modify a dataset that is cached in a Microsoft Office Excel workbook without starting Excel.
