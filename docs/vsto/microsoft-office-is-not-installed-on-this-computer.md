# Microsoft Office is not installed on the computer
  Visual Studio cannot find the Microsoft Office application that corresponds to the project type. If you are developing a VSTO Add-in project, it means that you cannot debug or run the project. If you are trying to create a document-level project, this means that you cannot create the project.

## To correct the error

1. Install the Microsoft Office application associated with the project type, including the primary interop assemblies. For more information about supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Configure a computer to develop Office solutions](../vsto/configuring-a-computer-to-develop-office-solutions.md).
