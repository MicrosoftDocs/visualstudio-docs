 You can map an XML schema to a document while the document is open in Visual Studio. You use the same Microsoft Office Word tools that you use when the document is open outside of Visual Studio. The Office project creates the same objects whether you map the schema to the document before or after you create your Word solution.

## To map an XML schema to a Word document in Visual Studio

1. Open the Word document or template project inside Visual Studio.

2. Click in the document to move the focus to the designer.

3. On the ribbon, click the **Developer** tab.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Developer** tab is not visible, you must first show it. For more information, see [How to: Show the developer tab on the ribbon](../vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon.md).

4. In the **XML** group, click **Schema**.

     The **Templates and Add-ins** dialog box opens.

5. Click the **XML Schema** tab.

6. Click **Add Schema**.

     The **Add Schema** dialog box opens.

7. Browse to your schema file, select it, and then click **Open**.

     The **Schema Settings** dialog box opens.

8. Assign an alias or click **OK** to add the schema without an alias.

9. Click **OK**.

     The **XML Structure** window opens.

10. Drag elements from the **XML Structure** window to the places in your document where you want the corresponding controls to be created.
