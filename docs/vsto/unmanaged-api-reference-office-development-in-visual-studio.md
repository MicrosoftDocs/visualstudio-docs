# Unmanaged API reference (Office development in Visual Studio)

Starting with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Office applications use the [IManagedAddin interface](../vsto/imanagedaddin-interface.md) interface to call into a VSTO Add-in loader component that is included with the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)]. This component is used to help load-managed VSTO Add-ins. You can create your own VSTO Add-in loader component by implementing this interface.

[!include[Add-ins note](includes/addinsnote.md)]

## In this section

[IManagedAddin interface](../vsto/imanagedaddin-interface.md)

A COM interface that you can implement to load and unload managed VSTO Add-ins in Office applications.
