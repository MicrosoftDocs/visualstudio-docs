# Unmanaged API Reference (Office Development in Visual Studio)
  Starting with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Office applications use the [IManagedAddin Interface](../vsto/imanagedaddin-interface.md) interface to call into an VSTO Add-in loader component that is included with the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../vsto/includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)]. This component is used to help load managed VSTO Add-ins. You can create your own VSTO Add-in loader component by implementing this interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.  
  
## In This Section  
 [IManagedAddin Interface](../vsto/imanagedaddin-interface.md)  
 A COM interface that you can implement to load and unload managed VSTO Add-ins in Office applications.
