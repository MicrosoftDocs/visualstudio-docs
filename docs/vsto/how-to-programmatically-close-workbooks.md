# How to: Programmatically close workbooks
  You can close the active workbook or you can specify a workbook to close.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Close the active workbook
 There are two procedures for closing the active workbook: one for document-level customizations and one for VSTO Add-ins.

### To close the active workbook in a document-level customization

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Workbook.Close%2A> method to close the workbook associated with the customization. To use the following code example, run it in the `Sheet1` class in a document-level project for Excel.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#3](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#3](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#3)]

### To close the active workbook in a VSTO Add-in

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Workbook.Close%2A> method to close the active workbook. To use the following code example, run it in the `ThisAddIn` class in a VSTO Add-in project for Excel.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.vb#1)]

## Close a workbook that you specify by name
 The way that you close a workbook that you specify by name is the same for VSTO Add-ins and document-level customizations.

### To close a workbook that you specify by name

1. Specify the workbook name as an argument to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks> collection. The following code example assumes that a workbook named **NewWorkbook** is open in Excel.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#2](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationAddIn#2](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/trin_vstcoreexcelautomationaddin/ThisAddIn.vb#2)]
