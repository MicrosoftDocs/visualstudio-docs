# How to: Programmatically refer to worksheet ranges in code
  You use a similar process to refer to the contents of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control or a native Excel range object.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Use a NamedRange control
 The following example adds a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> to a worksheet and then adds text to the cell in the range.

### To refer to a NamedRange control

1. Assign a string to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Value2%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control. This code must be placed in a sheet class, not in the `ThisWorkbook` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#46](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#46)]

## Use native Excel ranges
 The following example adds a native Excel range to a worksheet and then adds text to the cell in the range.

### To refer to a native range object

1. Assign a string to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Value2%2A> property of the range.
