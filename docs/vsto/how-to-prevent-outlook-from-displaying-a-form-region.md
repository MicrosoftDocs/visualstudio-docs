# How to: Prevent Outlook from displaying a form region
  There might be situations in which you do not want Microsoft Office Outlook to display a form region for a particular item. For example, if a contact item does not contain a business address, you can prevent a form region that shows the location of the business in a map from appearing.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_olkallapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-olkallapp-md.md)]

## To prevent Outlook from displaying a form region

1. Open the code file for the form region you want to modify.

2. Expand the **Form Region Factory** code region.

3. Add code to the `FormRegionInitializing` event handler that sets the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> property of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Outlook.FormRegionInitializingEventArgs> class to **true**.

   In this example, if the contact item does not contain an address, the <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> property is set to **true**, and the form region does not appear.

## Example
 [!code-csharp[Trin_Outlook_FR_Separate#1](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_Outlook_FR_Separate_O12/MapIt.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[Trin_Outlook_FR_Separate#1](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_Outlook_FR_Separate_O12/MapIt.vb#1)]
