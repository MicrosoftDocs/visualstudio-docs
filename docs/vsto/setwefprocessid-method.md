# SetWefProcessId method
  Provides the process identifier that will run Web Extensions Framework (WEF) content.

## Syntax

```csharp
HRESULT SetWefProcessId(
    [in] DWORD dwProcessId
);
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*dwProcessId*|The process identifier that will be used to run WEF content.|

## Return value
 An HRESULT value that indicates whether the method completed successfully.

## Remarks
 This method must be called after the WEF content process is created but before any WEF content runs.

 If you want the development environment to attach a debugger to the WEF content process, the environment must perform this operation in your implementation of this method.
