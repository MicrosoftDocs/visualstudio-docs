# How to: Programmatically group rows in a worksheet
  You can group one or more whole rows. To create a group in a worksheet, use a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control or a native Excel range object.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Use a NamedRange control
 If you add a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control to a document-level project at design time, you can use the control to programmatically create a group. The following example assumes that there are three <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> controls on the same worksheet: `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll`. Each named range refers to a whole row in the worksheet.

### To create a group of NamedRange controls on a worksheet

1. Group three named ranges by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Group%2A> method of each range. This code must be placed in a sheet class, not in the `ThisWorkbook` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#32](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#32)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > To ungroup rows, call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.Ungroup%2A> method.

## Use native Excel ranges
 The code assumes that you have three Excel ranges named `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll` on a worksheet.

### To create a group of Excel ranges in a worksheet

1. Group three named ranges by calling the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Group%2A> method of each range. The following example assumes that there are three <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> controls named `data2001`, `data2002`, and `dataAll` on the same worksheet. Each named range refers to a whole row in the worksheet.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#33](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#33)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > To ungroup rows, call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Ungroup%2A> method.
