# How to: Programmatically add and delete worksheet comments
  You can programmatically add and delete comments in Microsoft Office Excel worksheets. Comments can be added only to single cells, not to multi-cell ranges.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Add and delete a comment in a document-level project
 The following examples assume that there is a single-cell <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control named `dateComment` on a worksheet named `Sheet1`.

### To add a new comment to a named range

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange.AddComment%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control and supply the comment text. This code must be placed in the `Sheet1` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#30](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#30)]

#### To delete a comment from a named range

1. Verify that a comment exists on the range and delete it. This code must be placed in the `Sheet1` class.

     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#29](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#29)]

## Add and delete a comment in a VSTO Add-in project
 The following examples assume that there is a single-cell <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> named `dateComment` on the active worksheet.

### To add a new comment to an Excel range

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AddComment%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> and supply the comment text.
