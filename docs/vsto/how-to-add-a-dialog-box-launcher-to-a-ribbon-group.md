# How to: Add a Dialog box launcher to a Ribbon group
  You can add a dialog box launcher to any group on a Ribbon. A dialog box launcher is a small icon that appears in a group. Users click this icon to open related dialog boxes or task panes that provide more options that relate to the group.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_ribbon](../vsto/includes/appliesto-ribbon-md.md)]

### To add a dialog box launcher to a Ribbon group

1. Select the Ribbon code file (*.vb* or *.cs* file) in **Solution Explorer**.

2. On the **View** menu, click **Designer**.

3. In the Ribbon Designer, right-click any group, and then click **Add DialogBoxLauncher**.

     Add code to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Ribbon.RibbonGroup.DialogLauncherClick> event of the group to open a custom or built-in dialog box.
