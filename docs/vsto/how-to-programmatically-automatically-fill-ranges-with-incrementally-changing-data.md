# How to: Programmatically automatically fill ranges with incrementally changing data
  The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AutoFill%2A> method of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> object enables you to fill a range in a worksheet with values automatically. Most often, the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AutoFill%2A> method is used to store incrementally increasing or decreasing values in a range. You can specify the behavior by supplying an optional constant from the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlAutoFillType> enumeration.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

 You must specify two ranges when using <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AutoFill%2A>:

- The range that calls the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AutoFill%2A> method, which specifies the starting point of the fill and contains an initial value.

- The range that you want to fill, passed as a parameter to the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.AutoFill%2A> method. This destination range must include the range that contains the initial value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot pass a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> control in place of the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range>. For more information, see [Programmatic limitations of host items and host controls](../vsto/programmatic-limitations-of-host-items-and-host-controls.md).

## Example
 [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#49](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#49)]
 [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#49](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#49)]

## Compile the code
 The first cell of the range that you want to fill must contain an initial value.

 The example requires that you fill three regions:

- Column B is to include five weekdays. For the initial value, type **Monday** in cell B1.

- Column C is to include five months. For the initial value, type **January** in cell C1.

- Column D is to include a series of numbers, incrementing by two for each row. For the initial values, type **4** in cell D1 and **6** in cell D2.
