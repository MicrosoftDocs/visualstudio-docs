# Special characters to escape

Special characters must be escaped only if they have special meaning in the context in which they are being used. For example, the asterisk (*) is a special character only in the "Include" and "Exclude" attributes of an item definition, or in a call to <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.CreateItem>. In all other cases, the asterisk is treated as a literal asterisk. While you do not need to escape asterisks everywhere in project files, doing so does no harm.

 Use the notation %\<xx> in place of the special character, where \<xx> represents the hexadecimal value of the ASCII character. For example, to use an asterisk (*) as a literal character, use the value `%2A`.

 The full list of special characters to escape follows:

|Character|ASCII encoding|Description|
|---------|----------|-----------|
|%|%25|Percent sign, used to reference metadata.|
|$|%24|Dollar sign, used to reference properties.|
|@|%40|At sign, used to reference item lists.|
|(|%28|Open parenthesis, used in lists.|
|)|%29|Close parenthesis, used in lists.|
|;|%3B|Semicolon, a list separator.|
|?|%3F|Question mark, a wildcard character when describing a file spec in an item's Include/Exclude section.|
|* |%2A|Asterisk, a wildcard character when describing a file spec in an item's Include/Exclude section.|

> [!NOTE]
> In some scenarios, you may need to escape double quote (") characters, such as when using within an `Exec` task.
