# MSBuild Inline Tasks
MSBuild tasks are typically created by compiling a class that implements the <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask> interface. For more information, see [Tasks](../msbuild/msbuild-tasks.md).  
  
 Starting in .NET Framework version 4, you can create tasks inline in the project file. You do not have to create a separate assembly to host the task. This makes it easier to keep track of source code and easier to deploy the task. The source code is integrated into the script.  
  

 In MSBuild 15.8, the [RoslnCodeTaskFactory](../msbuild/msbuild-roslyncodetaskfactory.md) was added which can create .NET Standard cross-platform inline tasks.  If you need to use inline tasks on .NET Core, you must use the RoslynCodeTaskFactory.
## The Structure of an Inline Task  
 An inline task is contained by a [UsingTask](../msbuild/usingtask-element-msbuild.md) element. The inline task and the `UsingTask` element that contains it are typically included in a .targets file and imported into other project files as required. Here is a basic inline task. Notice that it does nothing.  
  
```xml  
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <!-- This simple inline task does nothing. -->  
  <UsingTask  
    TaskName="DoNothing"  
    TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"  
    AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core.dll" >  
    <ParameterGroup />  
    <Task>  
      <Reference Include="" />  
      <Using Namespace="" />  
      <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">  
      </Code>  
    </Task>  
  </UsingTask>  
</Project>  
```  
  
 The `UsingTask` element in the example has three attributes that describe the task and the inline task factory that compiles it.  
  
-   The `TaskName` attribute names the task, in this case, `DoNothing`.  
  
-   The `TaskFactory` attribute names the class that implements the inline task factory.  
  
-   The `AssemblyFile` attribute gives the location of the inline task factory. Alternatively, you can use the `AssemblyName` attribute to specify the fully qualified name of the inline task factory class, which is typically located in the global assembly cache (GAC).  
  
 The remaining elements of the `DoNothing` task are empty and are provided to illustrate the order and structure of an inline task. A more robust example is presented later in this topic.  
  
-   The `ParameterGroup` element is optional. When specified, it declares the parameters for the task. For more information about input and output parameters, see "Input and Output Parameters" later in this topic.  
  
-   The `Task` element describes and contains the task source code.  
  
-   The `Reference` element specifies references to the .NET assemblies that you are using in your code. This is equivalent to adding a reference to a project in Visual Studio. The `Include` attribute specifies the path of the referenced assembly.  
  
-   The `Using` element lists the namespaces that you want to access. This resembles the `Using` statement in Visual C#. The `Namespace` attribute specifies the namespace to include.  
  
 `Reference` and `Using` elements are language-agnostic. Inline tasks can be written in any one of the supported .NET CodeDom languages, for example, Visual Basic or Visual C#.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Elements contained by the `Task` element are specific to the task factory, in this case, the code task factory.  
  
### Code Element  
 The last child element to appear within the `Task` element is the `Code` element. The `Code` element contains or locates the code that you want to be compiled into a task. What you put in the `Code` element depends on how you want to write the task.  
  
 The `Language` attribute specifies the language in which your code is written. Acceptable values are `cs` for C#, `vb` for Visual Basic.  
  
 The `Type` attribute specifies the type of code that is found in the `Code` element.  
  
-   If the value of `Type` is `Class`, then the `Code` element contains code for a class that derives from the <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask> interface.  
  
-   If the value of `Type` is `Method`, then the code defines an override of the `Execute` method of the <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask> interface.  
  
-   If the value of `Type` is `Fragment`, then the code defines the contents of the `Execute` method, but not the signature or the `return` statement.  
  
 The code itself typically appears between a `<![CDATA[` marker and a `]]>` marker. Because the code is in a CDATA section, you do not have to worry about escaping reserved characters, for example, "\<" or ">".  
  
 Alternatively, you can use the `Source` attribute of the `Code` element to specify the location of a file that contains the code for your task. The code in the source file must be of the type that is specified by the `Type` attribute. If the `Source` attribute is present, the default value of `Type` is `Class`. If `Source` is not present, the default value is `Fragment`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When defining the task class in the source file, the class name must agree with the `TaskName` attribute of the corresponding [UsingTask](../msbuild/usingtask-element-msbuild.md) element.  
  
## Hello World  
 Here is a more robust inline task. The HelloWorld task displays "Hello, world!" on the default error logging device, which is typically the system console or the Visual Studio **Output** window. The `Reference` element in the example is included just for illustration.  
  
```xml  
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <!-- This simple inline task displays "Hello, world!" -->  
  <UsingTask  
    TaskName="HelloWorld"  
    TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"  
    AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core.dll" >  
    <ParameterGroup />  
    <Task>  
      <Reference Include="System.Xml"/>
      <Using Namespace="System"/>  
      <Using Namespace="System.IO"/>  
      <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">  
<![CDATA[  
// Display "Hello, world!"  
Log.LogError("Hello, world!");  
]]>  
      </Code>  
    </Task>  
  </UsingTask>  
</Project>  
```  
  
 You could save the HelloWorld task in a file that is named HelloWorld.targets, and then invoke it from a project as follows.  
  
```xml  
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <Import Project="HelloWorld.targets" />  
  <Target Name="Hello">  
    <HelloWorld />  
  </Target>  
</Project>  
```  
  
## Input and Output Parameters  
 Inline task parameters are child elements of a `ParameterGroup` element. Every parameter takes the name of the element that defines it. The following code defines the parameter `Text`.  
  
```xml  
<ParameterGroup>  
    <Text />  
</ParameterGroup>  
```  
  
 Parameters may have one or more of these attributes:  
  
-   `Required` is an optional attribute that is `false` by default. If `true`, then the parameter is required and must be given a value before calling the task.  
  
-   `ParameterType` is an optional attribute that is `System.String` by default. It may be set to any fully qualified type that is either an item or a value that can be converted to and from a string by using System.Convert.ChangeType. (In other words, any type that can be passed to and from an external task.)  
  
-   `Output` is an optional attribute that is `false` by default. If `true`, then the parameter must be given a value before returning from the Execute method.  
  
 For example,  
  
```xml  
<ParameterGroup>  
    <Expression Required="true" />  
      <Files ParameterType="Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem[]" Required="true" />  
    <Tally ParameterType="System.Int32" Output="true" />  
</ParameterGroup>  
```  
  
 defines these three parameters:  
  
-   `Expression` is a required input parameter of type System.String.  
  
-   `Files` is a required item list input parameter.  
  
-   `Tally` is an output parameter of type System.Int32.  
  
 If the `Code` element has the `Type` attribute of `Fragment` or `Method`, then properties are automatically created for every parameter. Otherwise, properties must be explicitly declared in the task source code, and must exactly match their parameter definitions.  
  
## Example  
 The following inline task replaces every occurrence of a token in the given file with the given value.  
  
```xml  
<Project xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003' ToolsVersion="15.0">  
  
  <UsingTask TaskName="TokenReplace" TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory" AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core.dll">  
    <ParameterGroup>  
      <Path ParameterType="System.String" Required="true" />  
      <Token ParameterType="System.String" Required="true" />  
      <Replacement ParameterType="System.String" Required="true" />  
    </ParameterGroup>  
    <Task>  
      <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs"><![CDATA[  
string content = File.ReadAllText(Path);  
content = content.Replace(Token, Replacement);  
File.WriteAllText(Path, content);  
  
]]></Code>  
    </Task>  
  </UsingTask>  
  
  <Target Name='Demo' >  
    <TokenReplace Path="C:\Project\Target.config" Token="$MyToken$" Replacement="MyValue"/>  
  </Target>  
</Project>  
```
