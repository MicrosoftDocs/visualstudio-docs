# MSBuild best practices
We recommend the following best practices for writing MSBuild scripts:

-   Default property values are best handled by using the `Condition` attribute, and not by declaring a property whose default value can be overridden on the command line. For example, use

```xml
<MyProperty Condition="$(MyProperty) == ''">
   MyDefaultValue
</MyProperty>
```

-   Avoid wildcards when you select items. Instead, specify files explicitly. This makes it easier to track down errors that may occur when you add or delete files.
