# ResolveAssemblyReference task

Determines all assemblies that depend on the specified assemblies, including second and `n`th-order dependencies. See also [Troubleshoot build errors with assembly references](troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

## Parameters

 The following table describes the parameters of the <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.ResolveAssemblyReference> task.

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|`AllowedAssemblyExtensions`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> The assembly file name extensions to use when resolving references. The default file name extensions are `exe` and `dll`.|
|`AllowedRelatedFileExtensions`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> The file name extensions to use for a  search for files that are related to one another. The default extensions are `pdb` and `xml`.|
|`AppConfigFile`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies an *app.config* file from which to parse and extract bindingRedirect mappings. If this parameter is specified, the `AutoUnify` parameter must be `false`.|
|`Assemblies`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the items for which full paths and dependencies must be identified. These items can have either simple names like "System" or strong names like "System, Version=2.0.3500.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089".<br /><br /> Items passed to this parameter may optionally have the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `Private`: `Boolean` value. If `true`, then the item is copied locally. The default value is `true`.<br />-   `HintPath`: `String` value. Specifies the path and file name to use as a reference. This metadata is used when `{HintPathFromItem}` is specified in the `SearchPaths` parameter. The default value is an empty string.<br />-   `SpecificVersion`: `Boolean` value. If `true`, then the exact name specified in the `Include` attribute must match. If `false`, then any assembly with the same simple name works. If `SpecificVersion` isn't specified, then the task examines the value in the `Include` attribute of the item. If the attribute is a simple name, it behaves as if `SpecificVersion` was `false`. If the attribute is a strong name, it behaves as if `SpecificVersion` was `true`.<br />     When used with a Reference item type, the `Include` attribute needs to be the full fusion name of the assembly to be resolved. The assembly is only resolved if fusion exactly matches the `Include` attribute.<br />     When a project targets a .NET Framework version and references an assembly compiled for a higher .NET Framework version, the reference resolves only if it has `SpecificVersion` set to `true`.<br />     When a project targets a profile and references an assembly that isn't in the profile, the reference resolves only if it has `SpecificVersion` set to `true`.<br />-   `ExecutableExtension`: `String` value. When present, the resolved assembly must have this extension. When absent, `dll` is considered first, followed by `.exe`, for each examined directory.<br />-   `SubType`: `String` value. Only items with empty `SubType` metadata is resolved into full assembly paths. Items with nonempty `SubType` metadata are ignored.<br />-   `AssemblyFolderKey`: `String` value. This metadata is supported for legacy purposes. It specifies a user-defined registry key, such as **hklm\\\<VendorFolder>**, that `Assemblies` should use to resolve assembly references.|
|`AssemblyFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies a list of fully qualified assemblies for which to find dependencies.<br /><br /> Items passed to this parameter may optionally have the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `Private`: an optional `Boolean` value. If true, the item is copied locally.<br />-   `FusionName`: optional `String` metadata. Specifies the simple or strong name for this item. If this attribute is present, it can save time because the assembly file doesn't have to be opened to get the name.|
|`AssemblyInformationCacheOutputPath`|Optional `String` parameter.<br/><br/> If not null, serializes machine-agnostic information about AssemblyFiles inputs to the named file. This setting overrides the usual cache, so only use this setting if you're building an SDK with many references and intend to ship the cache to your customers.|
|`AssemblyInformationCachePaths`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem> parameter.<br/><br/> If not null, uses this set of caches as inputs if MSBuild can't find the usual cache in the obj folder. Typically provided by an SDK to improve first-build performance.|
|`AutoUnify`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> This parameter is used for building assemblies, such as DLLs, which can't have a normal *App.Config* file.<br /><br /> When `true`, the resulting dependency graph is automatically treated as if there were an *App.Config* file passed in to the AppConfigFile parameter. This virtual *App.Config* file has a bindingRedirect entry for each conflicting set of assemblies such that the highest version assembly is chosen. A consequence of this is that there will never be a warning about conflicting assemblies, because every conflict will have been resolved.<br /><br /> When `true`, each distinct remapping results in a high priority comment showing the old and new versions and that `AutoUnify` was `true`.<br /><br /> When `true`, the `AppConfigFile` parameter must be empty.<br /><br /> When `false`, no assembly version remapping will occur automatically. When two versions of an assembly are present, a warning is issued.<br /><br /> When `false`, each distinct conflict between different versions of the same assembly results in a high-priority comment. These comments are followed by a single warning. The warning has a unique error code and contains text that reads "Found conflicts between different versions of reference and dependent assemblies."<br /><br /> The default value is `false`.|
|`CandidateAssemblyFiles`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies a list of assemblies to use for the search and resolution process. Values passed to this parameter must be absolute file names or project-relative file names.<br /><br /> Assemblies in this list are considered when the `SearchPaths` parameter contains {CandidateAssemblyFiles} as one of the paths to consider.|
|`CopyLocalDependenciesWhenParentReferenceInGac`|Optional <xref:System.Boolean> parameter.<br /><br /> If true, to determine if a dependency should be copied locally, one of the checks done is to see if the parent reference in the project file has the Private metadata set. If set, then the Private value is used as a dependency.<br /><br /> If the metadata isn't set, then the dependency goes through the same checks as the parent reference. One of these checks is to see if the reference is in the GAC. If a reference is in the GAC, then it isn't copied locally, because it's assumed to be in the GAC on the target machine. This only applies to a specific reference and not its dependencies.<br /><br /> For example, a reference in the project file that is in the GAC isn't copied locally, but its dependencies are copied locally because they aren't in the GAC.<br /><br /> If false, project file references are checked to see if they're in the GAC, and are copied locally as appropriate.<br /><br /> Dependencies are checked to see if they're in the GAC and are also checked to see if the parent reference from the project file is in the GAC.<br /><br /> If the parent reference from the project file is in the GAC, the dependency isn't copied locally.<br /><br /> Whether this parameter is true or false, if there are multiple parent references and any of them aren't in the GAC, then all of them are copied locally.|
|`CopyLocalFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Returns every file in the `ResolvedFiles`, `ResolvedDependencyFiles`, `RelatedFiles`, `SatelliteFiles`, and `ScatterFiles` parameters that has `CopyLocal` item metadata with a value of `true`.|
|`DependsOnNETStandard`|`Boolean` output parameter. <br/><br/>Whether any of the resolved primary references depends on .NET Standard. |
|`DependsOnSystemRuntime`|`Boolean` output parameter. <br/><br/>Whether any of the resolved primary references depends on System.Runtime.|
|`DoNotCopyLocalIfInGac`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> Enables legacy mode for CopyLocal determination. If true, referenced assemblies won't be copied locally if they're found in the GAC. If false, assemblies are copied locally unless they were found only in the GAC. The default value is `false`.|
|`FilesWritten`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` output parameter.<br /><br /> Contains the items written to disk.|
|`FindDependencies`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, dependencies are found. Otherwise, only primary references are found. The default value is `true`.|
|`FindDependenciesOfExternallyResolvedReferences`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> Force dependencies to be walked even when a reference is marked with `ExternallyResolved=true` metadata.|
|`FindRelatedFiles`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, related files such as `pdb` files and `xml` files are found. The default value is `true`.|
|`FindSatellites`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, satellite assemblies are found. The default value is `true.`|
|`FindSerializationAssemblies`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, then the task searches for serialization assemblies. The default value is `true`.|
|`FullFrameworkAssemblyTables`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies items that have `FrameworkDirectory` metadata to associate a redist list with a particular framework directory. If the association isn't made, an error is logged. The resolve assembly reference (RAR) logic uses the target framework directory if a `FrameworkDirectory` isn't set.|
|`FullFrameworkFolders`|Optional <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName>`[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the folders that contain a RedistList directory. This directory represents the full framework for a given client profile, for example, *%programfiles%\reference assemblies\microsoft\framework\v4.0*.|
|`FullTargetFrameworkSubsetNames`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Contains a list of target framework subset names. If a subset name in the list matches one in the `TargetFrameworkSubset` name property, then the system excludes that particular target framework subset at build time.|
|`IgnoreDefaultInstalledAssemblyTables`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, then the task searches for and uses additional installed assembly tables (or, "Redist Lists") that are found in the *\RedistList* directory under `TargetFrameworkDirectories`. The default value is `false.`|
|`IgnoreDefaultInstalledAssemblySubsetTables`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, then the task searches for and uses additional installed assembly subset tables (or, "Subset Lists") that are found in the *\SubsetList* directory under `TargetFrameworkDirectories`. The default value is `false.`|
|`IgnoreTargetFrameworkAttributeVersionMismatch `|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, then the task resolves assemblies that target a higher .NET Framework version than the current project. The default value is `false`, which skips those references.|
|`IgnoreVersionForFrameworkReferences`| Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /> <br /> If the primary reference is a framework assembly, ignore its version information and actually resolve the framework assembly from the currently targeted framework.|
|`InstalledAssemblySubsetTables`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Contains a list of XML files that specify the assemblies that are expected to be in the target subset.<br /><br /> As an option, items in this list can specify the `FrameworkDirectory` metadata to associate an `InstalledAssemblySubsetTable`<br /><br /> with a particular framework directory.<br /><br /> If there's only one `TargetFrameworkDirectories` element, then any items in this list that lack the `FrameworkDirectory"` metadata are treated as though they're set to the unique value that is passed to `TargetFrameworkDirectories`.|
|`InstalledAssemblyTables`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> Contains a list of XML files that specify the assemblies that are expected to be installed on the target computer.<br /><br /> When `InstalledAssemblyTables` is set, earlier versions of the assemblies in the list are merged into the newer versions that are listed in the XML. Also, assemblies that have a setting of InGAC='true' are considered prerequisites and are set to `CopyLocal='false'` unless explicitly overridden.<br /><br /> As an option, items in this list can specify `FrameworkDirectory` metadata to associate an `InstalledAssemblyTable` with a particular framework directory. However, this setting is ignored unless the Redist name begins with<br /><br /> `Microsoft-Windows-CLRCoreComp`.<br /><br /> If there's only one `TargetFrameworkDirectories` element, then any items in this list that lack the `FrameworkDirectory` metadata are treated as if they're set to the unique value that is passed<br /><br /> to `TargetFrameworkDirectories`.|
|`LatestTargetFrameworkDirectories`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies a list of directories that contain the redist lists for the most current framework that can be targeted on the machine. If this isn't set, then the highest framework installed on the machine for a given target framework identifier is used.|
|`OutputUnresolvedAssemblyConflicts`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, outputs any unresolved assembly conflicts with diagnostic code MSB3277 into the output `UnresolveAssemblyConflicts`.|
|`ProfileName`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the name of the framework profile to be targeted. For example, Client, Web, or Network. Relevant only to .NET Framework profiles.|
|`RelatedFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Contains related files, such as XML and `pdb` files that have the same base name as a reference.<br /><br /> The files listed in this parameter may optionally contain the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `Primary`: `Boolean` value. If `true`, then the file item was passed into the array by using the `Assemblies` parameter. Default value is `false`.<br />-   `CopyLocal`: `Boolean` value. Indicates whether the given reference should be copied to the output directory.|
|`ResolvedDependencyFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Contains the *n*th order paths to dependencies. This parameter doesn't include first order primary references, which are contained in the `ResolvedFiles` parameter.<br /><br /> The items in this parameter optionally contain the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `CopyLocal`: `Boolean` value.

Specifies the literal search path that this file was resolved from.|
|`ResolvedSDKReferences`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` parameter.<br/><br/>A list of resolved SDK references, which contain the SDK name, SDK location, and the targeted configuration. These locations are only searched if the reference has the `SDKName` metadata attached to it.|
|`SatelliteFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies any satellite files found. These files are `CopyLocal=true` if the reference or dependency that caused this item to exist is `CopyLocal=true`.<br /><br /> The items in this parameter optionally contain the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `CopyLocal`: `Boolean` value. Indicates whether the given reference should be copied to the output directory. This value is `true` if the reference or dependency that caused this item to exist has a `CopyLocal` value of `true`.<br />-   `DestinationSubDirectory`: `String` value. Specifies the relative destination directory to copy this item to.|
|`ScatterFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Contains the scatter files associated with one of the given assemblies.<br /><br /> The items in this parameter optionally contain the following item metadata:<br /><br /> -   `CopyLocal`: `Boolean` value. Indicates whether the given reference should be copied to the output directory.|
|`SearchPaths`|Required `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the directories or special locations that are searched to find the files on disk that represent the assemblies. The order in which the search paths are listed is important. For each assembly, the list of paths is searched from left to right. When a file that represents the assembly is found, that search stops and the search for the next assembly starts.<br /><br /> This parameter accepts a semicolon-delimited list of values that can be either directory paths or special literal values from the list below:<br /><br /> -   `{HintPathFromItem}`: Instructs the task to examine the `HintPath` metadata of the base item.<br />-   `{CandidateAssemblyFiles}`: Instructs the task to examine the files passed in through the `CandidateAssemblyFiles` parameter.<br />-   `{Registry:` \<AssemblyFoldersBase>, \<RuntimeVersion>, \<AssemblyFoldersSuffix>`}`: Instructs the task to search in additional folders specified in the registry. \<AssemblyFoldersBase>, \<RuntimeVersion>, and \<AssemblyFoldersSuffix> should be replaced with specific values for the registry location to be searched. The default specification in the common targets is {Registry:$(FrameworkRegistryBase), $(TargetFrameworkVersion), $(AssemblyFoldersSuffix), $(AssemblyFoldersExConditions)}.<br />-   `{AssemblyFolders}`: Instructs the task to use the Visual Studio.NET 2003 finding-assemblies-from-registry scheme.<br />-   `{GAC}`: Instructs the task to search in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).<br />-   `{RawFileName}`: Specifies the task will consider the `Include` value of the item to be an exact path and file name.|
|`SerializationAssemblyFiles`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> Contains any XML serialization assemblies found. These items are marked CopyLocal=true if and only if the reference or dependency that caused this item to exist is CopyLocal=true.<br /><br /> The `Boolean` metadata CopyLocal indicates whether the given reference should be copied to the output directory.|
|`Silent`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If `true`, no messages are logged. The default value is `false`.|

This includes every culture and PKT that was found that didn't have a suitable `bindingRedirect` entry in the application configuration file.<br /><br /> Each item optionally contains the following information:<br /><br /> -   `Include` attribute: Contains the full name of the assembly family with a Version field value of `0.0.0.0`<br />-   `MaxVersion` item metadata: Contains the maximum version number.|
|`SupportsBindingRedirectGeneration`| Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> Set this to `true` on supported projects to generate binding redirects automatically (currently supported only for EXE projects).|
|`TargetedRuntimeVersion`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the runtime version to target, for example, 2.0.57027 or v2.0.57027.|
|`TargetFrameworkDirectories`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the path of the target framework directory. This parameter is required to determine the `CopyLocal` status for resulting items.<br /><br /> If this parameter isn't specified, no resulting items will have a `CopyLocal` value of `true` unless they explicitly have a `Private` metadata value of `true` on their source item.|
|`TargetFrameworkMoniker`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> The `TargetFrameworkMoniker` to monitor, if any. This parameter is used for logging.|
|`TargetFrameworkMonikerDisplayName`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> The display name of the TargetFrameworkMoniker to monitor, if any. This parameter is used for logging.|
|`TargetFrameworkSubsets`|Optional `String[]` parameter.<br /><br /> Contains a list of target framework subset names to be searched for in the target framework directories.|
|`TargetFrameworkVersion`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> The project target framework version. The default value is empty, which means there's no filtering for the references based on target framework.|
|`TargetProcessorArchitecture`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> The preferred target processor architecture. Used for resolving Global Assembly Cache (GAC) references.<br /><br /> This parameter can have a value of `x86`, `IA64`, or `AMD64`.<br /><br /> If this parameter is absent, the task first considers assemblies that match the architecture of the currently running process. If no assembly is found, the task considers assemblies in the GAC that have `ProcessorArchitecture` value of `MSIL` or no `ProcessorArchitecture` value.|
|`UnresolvedAssemblyConflicts`|Optional <xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITaskItem>`[]` read-only output parameter.<br /><br /> If the parameter `OutputUnresolvedAssemblyConflicts` is `true`, then this is set to a list of information about unresolved conflicts that normally would have been outputted in MSB3277. Otherwise empty.|
|`UnresolveFrameworkAssembliesFromHigherFrameworks`|Optional `Boolean` parameter.<br /><br /> If set to `true`, it forces framework assemblies with versions higher or equal to the version of the target framework to an unresolved state.|
|`WarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch`|Optional `String` parameter.<br/><br/> If there's a mismatch between the target processor architecture and the architecture of a primary reference, when this is `Error`, an error is logged; when `Warning`, a warning is logged; when `None`, no error or warning is logged. Defaults to `Warning`.|
