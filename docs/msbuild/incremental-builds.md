# Incremental builds

MSBuild incremental builds are builds that are optimized so that targets that have output files that are up-to-date with respect to their corresponding input files aren't executed.

A target element can have both an `Inputs` attribute, which indicates what items the target expects as input, and an `Outputs` attribute, which indicates what items it produces as output. MSBuild attempts to find a one-to-one mapping between the values of these attributes. If such a mapping exists, MSBuild compares the time stamp of every input item to the time stamp of its corresponding output item. Output files that don't have a one-to-one mapping are compared to all input files. An item is considered up-to-date if its output file is the same age or newer than its input file or files.

> [!NOTE]
> When MSBuild evaluates the input files, only the contents of the list in the current execution are considered. Changes in the list from the last build don't automatically make a target out-of-date.

If all output items are up-to-date, MSBuild skips the target. This *incremental build* of the target can significantly improve the build speed. If only some files are up-to-date, MSBuild executes the target but skips the up-to-date items, and therefore brings all items up-to-date. This process is known as a *partial incremental build*.

One-to-one mappings can be produced only by making the `Outputs` attribute a transformation of the `Inputs` attribute. For more information, see [MSBuild transforms](../msbuild/msbuild-transforms.md).

 Consider the following target:

```xml
<Target Name="Backup" Inputs="@(Compile)"
    Outputs="@(Compile->'$(BackupFolder)%(Identity).bak')">
    <Copy SourceFiles="@(Compile)" DestinationFiles=
        "@(Compile->'$(BackupFolder)%(Identity).bak')" />
</Target>
```

The set of files represented by the `Compile` item type is copied to a backup directory. The backup files have the `.bak` file name extension. If the files represented by the `Compile` item type, or the corresponding backup files, aren't deleted or modified after the `Backup` target is run, then the `Backup` target is skipped in subsequent builds.

## Output inference

MSBuild compares the `Inputs` and `Outputs` attributes of a target to determine if the target needs to execute. Ideally, the set of files that exists after an incremental build is completed should remain the same whether or not the associated targets are executed. Because properties and items that tasks create or alter can affect the build, MSBuild must infer their values even if the target that affects them is skipped. This process is known as *output inference*.

There are three cases:

- The target has a `Condition` attribute that evaluates to `false`. In this case, the target isn't run, and has no effect on the build.

- The target has out-of-date outputs and is run to bring them up-to-date.

- The target has no out-of-date outputs and is skipped. MSBuild evaluates the target and makes changes to items and properties as if the target ran.

To support incremental compilation, tasks must ensure that the `TaskParameter` attribute value of any `Output` element is equal to a task input parameter. For example:

```xml
<CreateProperty Value="123">
    <Output PropertyName="Easy" TaskParameter="Value" />
</CreateProperty>
```

This code creates the property `Easy`, which has the value `123` whether or not the target is executed or skipped.

Starting in MSBuild 3.5, output inference is performed automatically on item and property groups in a target. `CreateItem` tasks aren't required in a target and should be avoided. Also, `CreateProperty` tasks should be used in a target only to determine whether a target was executed.

Before MSBuild 3.5, you can use the [CreateItem](../msbuild/createitem-task.md) task.

## Determine whether a target is run

Because of output inference, you must examine the properties and items of a target to determine whether the target was executed. To do so, add the `CreateProperty` task to the target and give it an `Output` element whose `TaskParameter` is `ValueSetByTask`. For example:

```xml
<CreateProperty Value="true">
    <Output TaskParameter="ValueSetByTask" PropertyName="CompileRan" />
</CreateProperty>
```

This code creates the property `CompileRan` and gives it the value `true`, but only if the target is executed. If the target is skipped, `CompileRan` isn't created.
