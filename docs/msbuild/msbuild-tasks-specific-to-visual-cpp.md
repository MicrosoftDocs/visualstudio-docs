# MSBuild Tasks Specific to Visual C++
Tasks provide the code that runs during the build process. When Visual C++ is installed, the following tasks are available, in addition to those that are installed with [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)]. For more information, see [MSBuild (Visual C++) Overview](/cpp/build/msbuild-visual-cpp-overview).  
  
 In addition to the parameters for each task, every task also has the following parameters.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`Condition`|Optional `String` parameter.<br /><br /> A `Boolean` expression that the [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] engine uses to determine whether this task will be executed. For information about the conditions that are supported by [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)], see [Conditions](../msbuild/msbuild-conditions.md).|  
|`ContinueOnError`|Optional parameter. Can contain one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   **WarnAndContinue** or **true**. When a task fails, subsequent tasks in the [Target](../msbuild/target-element-msbuild.md) element and the build continue to execute, and all errors from the task are treated as warnings<br />-   **ErrorAndContinue**. When a task fails, subsequent tasks in the `Target` element and the build continue to execute, and all errors from the task are treated as errors.<br />-   **ErrorAndStop** or **false** (default). When a task fails, the remaining tasks in the`Target` element and the build aren't executed, and the entire `Target` element and the build are considered to have failed.<br /><br /> Versions of the .NET Framework before 4.5 supported only the `true` and `false` values.<br /><br /> For more information, see [How to: Ignore Errors in Tasks](../msbuild/how-to-ignore-errors-in-tasks.md).|
