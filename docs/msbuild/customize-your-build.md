# Customize your build
In versions of MSBuild prior to version 15, if you wanted to provide a new, custom property to projects in your solution, you had to manually add a reference to that property to every project file in the solution. Or, you had to define the property in a .props file and then explicitly import the .props file in every project in the solution, among other things.

However, now you can add a new property to every project in one step by defining it in a single file called Directory.Build.props at the root of your repo. When MSBuild runs, Microsoft.Common.props searches your directory structure for the Directory.Build.props file (and Microsoft.Common.targets looks for Directory.Build.targets). If it finds one, it imports the property. Directory.Build.props is a user-defined file that provides customizations to projects under a directory.

## Directory.Build.props example
For example, if you wanted to enable all of your projects to access the new Roslyn **/deterministic** feature (which is exposed in the Roslyn CoreCompile target by the property `$(Deterministic)`), you could do the following.

1. Create a new file in the root of your repo called Directory.Build.props.
2. Add the following XML to the file.

  ```xml
  <Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
      <Deterministic>true</Deterministic>
    </PropertyGroup>
  </Project>
  ```
3. Run MSBuild. Your projectâ€™s existing imports of Microsoft.Common.props and Microsoft.Common.targets find the file and import it.

## Search scope
When searching for a Directory.Build.props file, MSBuild walks the directory structure upwards from your project location ($(MSBuildProjectFullPath)), stopping after it locates a Directory.Build.props file. For example, if your $(MSBuildProjectFullPath) was c:\users\username\code\test\case1, MSBuild would start searching there and then search the directory structure upward until it located a Directory.Build.props file, as in the following directory structure.

```
c:\users\username\code\test\case1
c:\users\username\code\test
c:\users\username\code
c:\users\username
c:\users
c:\
```
The location of the solution file is irrelevant to Directory.Build.props.

## Import order

Directory.Build.props is imported very early in Microsoft.Common.props, so properties defined later are unavailable to it. So, avoid referring to properties that are not yet defined (and will thus evaluate to empty).

Directory.Build.targets is imported from Microsoft.Common.targets after importing .targets files from NuGet packages. So, it can be used to override properties and targets defined in most of the build logic, but at times it may be necessary to do customizations within the project file after the final import.

## Use case: multi-level merging

Suppose you have this standard solution structure:

````
\
  MySolution.sln
  Directory.Build.props     (1)
  \src
    Directory.Build.props   (2-src)
    \Project1
    \Project2
  \test
    Directory.Build.props   (2-test)
    \Project1Tests
    \Project2Tests
````

It might be desirable to have common properties for all projects `(1)`, common properties for `src` projects `(2-src)`, and common properties for `test` projects `(2-test)`.

For msbuild to correctly merge the "inner" files (`2-src` and `2-test`) with the "outer" file (`1`), you must take into account that once msbuild finds a `Directory.Build.props` file, it stops further scanning. To continue scanning, and merge into the outer file, place this into both inner files:

`<Import Project="$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Build.props'))" />`

A summary of msbuild's general approach is as follows:

- For any given project, msbuild finds the first `Directory.Build.props` upward in the solution structure, merges it with defaults, and stops scanning for more
- If you want multiple levels to be found and merged, then [`<Import...>`](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/property-functions#msbuild-getpathoffileabove) (shown above) the "outer" file from the "inner" file
- If the "outer" file does not itself also import something above it, then scanning stops there
- To control the scanning/merging process, use `$(DirectoryBuildPropsPath)` and `$(ImportDirectoryBuildProps)`

Or more simply: the first `Directory.Build.props` which doesn't import anything, is where msbuild stops.
