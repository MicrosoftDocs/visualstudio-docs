# Update an existing application for MSBuild 15

In versions of MSBuild prior to 15.0, MSBuild was loaded from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and MSBuild extensions were installed in the registry. This ensured all applications used the same version of MSBuild and had access to the same Toolsets, but prevented side-by-side installations of different versions of Visual Studio.

To support faster, smaller, and side-by-side installation, Visual Studio 2017 and later versions no longer place MSBuild in the GAC or modifies the registry. Unfortunately, this means that applications that wish to use the MSBuild API to evaluate or build projects can't implicitly rely on the Visual Studio installation.

## Use MSBuild from Visual Studio

To ensure that programmatic builds from your application match builds done within Visual Studio or *MSBuild.exe*, load MSBuild assemblies from Visual Studio and use the SDKs available within Visual Studio. The Microsoft.Build.Locator NuGet package streamlines this process.

## Use Microsoft.Build.Locator

If you redistribute *Microsoft.Build.Locator.dll* with your application, you won't need to distribute other MSBuild assemblies.

Updating a project to use MSBuild 15 and the locator API requires a few changes in your project, described below. To see an example of the changes required to update a project, see [the commits made to an example project in the MSBuildLocator repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSBuildLocator/commits/example-updating-to-msbuild-15).

### Change MSBuild references

To make sure that MSBuild loads from a central location, you must not distribute its assemblies with your application.

The mechanism for changing your project to avoid loading MSBuild from a central location depends on how you reference MSBuild.

#### Use NuGet packages (preferred)

These instructions assume that you're using [PackageReference-style NuGet references](/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files).

Change your project file(s) to reference MSBuild assemblies from their NuGet packages. Specify `ExcludeAssets=runtime` to tell NuGet that the assemblies are needed only at build time, and shouldn't be copied to the output directory.

The major and minor version of the MSBuild packages must be less than or equal to the minimum version of Visual Studio you wish to support. For example, if you wish to support Visual Studio 2017 and later versions, reference package version `15.1.548`.

For example, you can use this XML:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build" Version="15.1.548" ExcludeAssets="runtime" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core" Version="15.1.548" ExcludeAssets="runtime" />
</ItemGroup>
```

#### Use extension assemblies

If you can't use NuGet packages, you can reference MSBuild assemblies that are distributed with Visual Studio. If you reference MSBuild directly, ensure that it won't be copied to your output directory by setting `Copy Local` to `False`. In the project file, this setting will look like the following code:

```xml
    <Reference Include="Microsoft.Build, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
      <Private>False</Private>
    </Reference>
```

#### Binding redirects

Reference the Microsoft.Build.Locator package to ensure that your application automatically uses the required binding redirects to version 15.1.0.0. Binding redirects to this version support both MSBuild 15 and MSBuild 16.

### Ensure output is clean

Build your project and inspect the output directory to make sure that it doesn't contain any *Microsoft.Build.\*.dll* assemblies other than *Microsoft.Build.Locator.dll*, added in the next step.

### Add package reference for Microsoft.Build.Locator

Add a NuGet package reference for [Microsoft.Build.Locator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Locator/).

```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build.Locator">
      <Version>1.1.2</Version>
    </PackageReference>
```

Do not specify `ExcludeAssets=runtime` for the Microsoft.Build.Locator package.

### Register instance before calling MSBuild

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot reference any MSBuild types (from the `Microsoft.Build` namespace) in the method that calls MSBuildLocator. For example, you cannot do this:
>
> ```csharp
> void ThisWillFail()
> {
>     MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults();
>     Project p = new Project(SomePath); // Could be any MSBuild type
>     // Code that uses the MSBuild type
> }
> ```
>
> Instead, you must do this:
>
> ```csharp
> void MethodThatDoesNotDirectlyCallMSBuild()
> {
>     MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults();
>     MethodThatCallsMSBuild();
> }
> 
> void MethodThatCallsMSBuild()
> {
>     Project p = new Project(SomePath);
>     // Code that uses the MSBuild type
> }
> ```

The simplest way to add the call to the Locator API is to add a call to

```csharp
MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults();
```

in your application startup code.

If you would like finer-grained control over the loading of MSBuild, you can select a result of `MSBuildLocator.QueryVisualStudioInstances()` to pass to `MSBuildLocator.RegisterInstance()` manually, but this is generally not needed.
