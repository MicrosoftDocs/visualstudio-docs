<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB8029 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB8029: The Intermediate directory or Output directory cannot reside under the Temporary directory as it could lead to issues with incremental build.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when the intermediate directory and output directory are located in the *Temporary* directory.

## Resolution

For each project in your solution, set your intermediate and output build directory properties for each supported configuration and platform to use a directory that's not under the *Temporary* directory.

To set the locations for the two directories, follow these steps:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project node, and select **Properties**.
1. In the **Property Pages** dialog for the project, select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page.
1. For each configuration in the project, set the **Intermediate Directory** property and the **Output Directory** property.
1. Select **OK** to save your changes.
