## Message text

`MSB4099: A reference to an item list at position 'value' is not allowed in this condition 'value'.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB4099: "}
-->
This error occurs when a project is using an item in a condition in a context where it's not yet available for use. MSBuild evaluates a project file using multiple passes. `Import` elements, top-level `PropertyGroup` elements, and their `Property` elements are evaluated before items are evaluated. As a result, items are unavailable at the point when those elements are evaluated. Therefore, you can't use items in conditions in any of those elements. See [How MSBuild builds projects](../build-process-overview.md#evaluation-phase).

To fix this issue, restructure your logic to avoid the need to reference an item in a condition in an `Import` element, `PropertyGroup` element, or `Property` element at the top level.
