# MSB3284

This error occurs when MSBuild can't get the file path for a requested type library.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by additional information from the operating system:

```output
MSB3284: Cannot get the file path for type library 'name' version 'version'.
```

Look to the additional information provided by the operating system to determine the cause of the problem. Typical causes include incorrect or invalid GUIDs, incorrect version numbers, or a component is not installed.

Try checking the registry yourself to make sure the requested component is represented. See [COM Registry Keys](/windows/win32/com/com-registry-keys).
