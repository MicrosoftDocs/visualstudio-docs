# MSB3248 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3248 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB3248: Parameter 'value' has invalid value 'value'.`
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<!-- MSB3248: Parameter "{0}" has invalid value "{1}". {2} -->

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

The error code MSB3248 occurs in the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task in MSBuild when there's an issue with the parameters specified for resolving assembly references. The `ResolveAssemblyReference` task is responsible for resolving assembly references in a project. You don't normally invoke this task directly; it's called during the .NET build process.

### Common causes

The most likely cause is an MSBuild property setting that creates an issue with the assembly resolution process. See [Common MSBuild properties](../common-msbuild-project-properties.md).

## Resolution

Look at what specific parameter triggers the error and its value and review how it's set or modified in your project files or imported files.

Enable detailed logging for your MSBuild process by using the `/v:diag` verbosity flag:

```bash
msbuild MyProject.proj /v:diag
```

This option provides a detailed log output, which should be helpful to determine which assembly reference is triggering the issue. Then, check the values of the properties that are related to that assembly, and the project that references it.

You can also create a binary log by using the `-bl` command-line option, and use MSBuild [structured log viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to more easily view the log output. For more information, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).
