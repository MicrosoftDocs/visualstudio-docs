## Message text

`MSB4024: The imported project file 'filename' could not be loaded.`

## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to load a project file, but can't load an imported file. The imported file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, `.targets` file, or a file with any other extension that contains XML intended for interpretation by MSBuild.

## Resolution

Verify the correct file is being imported. The standard output message text is followed by additional information from the operating system. Look to the additional information provided by the operating system to determine the cause of the problem. For more information, see [Import element (MSBuild)](../import-element-msbuild.md).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
