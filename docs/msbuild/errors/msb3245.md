# MSB3245

This article describes the MSB3245 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. 'assembly' If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.`

## Description

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild can't resolve an assembly reference in your project.

## Resolution

This error might occur if the item is a directory, not a file, or if the assembly resolver for the reference returns an error. Any error might prevent resolution of the reference, such as a missing assembly, a misspelled name, version mismatch, mismatched processor architecture, or failed `ProjectReference`.

For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md) and [MSBuild ResolveAssemblyReference Task Documentation](../resolveassemblyreference-task.md).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
