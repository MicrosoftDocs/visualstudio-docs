# MSBuild MSB8088 diagnostic code

> MSB8088: Dynamic debugging and whole program optimization are incompatible. Disabling whole program optimization.
When you turn on [C++ Dynamic Debugging (Preview)](/visualstudio/debugger/cpp-dynamic-debugging), the build automatically turns off whole program optimization (compiler switch [`/GL`](/cpp/build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization)). These two options are incompatible.

To resolve this issue, turn off whole program optimization in the project properties by setting **Configuration Properties** > **Advanced** > **Whole Program Optimization** to **Off**. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project).

`MSB8088` is treated as a warning, but may be treated as an error in a future version of Visual Studio.
