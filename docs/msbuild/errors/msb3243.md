# MSB3243

This article describes the MSB3243 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3243: No way to resolve conflict between 'first assembly' and 'second assembly'. Choosing 'first assembly' arbitrarily.`

## Description

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild finds two conflicting assemblies for a given reference, with no way to resolve the conflict. In such cases, MSBuild chooses one of the assemblies arbitrarily and continues processing the build.

## Resolution

A diagnostic build log has more information about how the two conflicting assemblies were found. The log information might help you to restructure your build to avoid the warning.

For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
