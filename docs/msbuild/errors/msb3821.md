# MSB3821: Couldn't process file 'path' due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file

This error occurs when MSBuild attempts to process a file downloaded from the web (or a cloud drive) with security restrictions.

When you download web assets such as HTML pages to a Windows device using a browser, the browser inserts a marker called the *mark of the web*, which records the security zone of the site from which the page originated. This is intended to protect from potentially malicious pages and enforce the security level on the original site, even after a page from the site is downloaded. This security check is required due to this security issue: [Visual Studio Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2018-8172](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2018-8172).

 MSBuild respects this security restriction, but if you decide that you trust the content in question, but you can override the restriction by unblocking a single file from File Explorer (open the **Properties** window on the file, and check **Unblock**). To unblock multiple files using a PowerShell script, use the [Unblock-File](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/unblock-file) cmdlet.

The full message is similar to the following text:

```output
Couldn't process file 'path' due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone or having the mark of the web on the file.
Remove the mark of the web if you want to process these files.
```

Visual Studio also includes security restrictions that detect the mark of the web comment. You can customize these settings in the **Tools** > **Options** section **Trust Settings**. See [Configure trust settings for files and folders](../../ide/reference/trust-settings.md).

If you can't fix the error directly in Visual Studio, then close Visual Studio, go to the projects folder in File Explorer, open the **Properties menu** of the file that's giving you the error (keyboard: **Alt** + **Enter**), check the checkbox with the label **Unblock**, then click **Apply** and close the window.  When you reopen Visual Studio and open your project, try building again.

From PowerShell, you can use the command [Unblock-File](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/unblock-file).
