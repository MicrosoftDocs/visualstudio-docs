# MSBuild error MSB8020

> MSB8020: The build tools for *toolset-name* (Platform Toolset = '*platform-toolset*') cannot be found. To build using the *platform-toolset* build tools, please install *toolset-name* build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution".

A platform toolset is a collection of build tools for a particular version of Microsoft C++ (MSVC) and target platform. For example, MSVC v143 for Visual Studio 2022. The C++ compiler further has  a toolset version that increments with each minor release, for example, MSVC 14.42 for Visual Studio 17.12. See [Use the Microsoft C++ toolset from the command line](/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170) and [MSVC Toolset Minor Version Number 14.40 in VS 2022 v17.10](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-toolset-minor-version-number-14-40-in-vs-2022-v17-10/).

To resolve this issue, upgrade the project to use the current Visual Studio toolset, or use the Visual Studio Installer to install the specified build toolset. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platform toolsets.
