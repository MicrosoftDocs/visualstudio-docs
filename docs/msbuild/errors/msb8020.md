# MSBuild error MSB8020

This article describes the MSB8020 error message.

## Message text

`MSB8020: The build tools for *toolset-name* (Platform Toolset = '*platform-toolset*') cannot be found. To build using the *platform-toolset* build tools, please install *toolset-name* build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution".`

## Remarks

A platform toolset is a collection of build tools for a particular version of Microsoft C++ (MSVC) and target platform. 

For C++ projects, the `$(PlatformToolset)` property (for example, v143) points to a folder in VS install, which contains MSBuild `.props` and `.targets` files that support a particular build toolset, see [Add a new platform toolset](../../extensibility/visual-cpp-project-extensibility.md#add-a-new-platform-toolset).

If this folder does not exist, the MSB8020 error occurs.

## Resolution

The native tools are architecture-specific and need to be installed for each platform (`$(Platform)`), which represents the target architecture. For instance, for Windows Desktop ARM64 support, you need to install MSVC ARM64 components found in the individual components. See [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md).

For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) projects (that is, projects which have `$(ApplicationType)` set as "Windows Store"), a specific UWP MSVC version (v143, v142, and so on) should be installed as a part of UWP workflow, which is an optional component. If you only install desktop MSVC support, but not the UWP component, this error occurs when you try to build a UWP project. Each UWP MSVC toolset includes support for all target architectures.

The missing platform toolset can also come from a Visual Studio extension (see [Visual Studio C++ Project system extensibility and toolset integration](../../extensibility/visual-cpp-project-extensibility.md#add-a-new-platform-toolset)). In this case, search for the name of the toolset in the Visual Studio extension gallery and install it from there.
