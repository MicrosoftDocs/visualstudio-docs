# MSB3024 diagnostic code

This article describes the MSB3024 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB3024: Could not copy the file 'value' to the destination file 'value', because the destination is a folder instead of a file. To copy the source file into a folder, consider using the DestinationFolder parameter instead of DestinationFiles.`
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<!-- MSB3024: Could not copy the file "{0}" to the destination file "{1}", because the destination is a folder instead of a file. To copy the source file into a folder, consider using the DestinationFolder parameter instead of DestinationFiles. -->

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when, in the course of the build, an operation attempts to copy a file to another location, but the destination location already contains a folder of the same name. This is specifically generated by the MSBuild [Copy task](../copy-task.md) when it is passed a `DestinationFiles` parameter that contained a folder, rather than a set of files.

## Resolution

You can get more information by running MSBuild with the `-v:diag` switch. The issue could occur if some previous part of the build created the folder, so you can check the log for what part of the build process does this.


 If you control the target that calls the `Copy` task, and you intended to copy to a folder, you can accomplish that by using the `DestinationFolder` parameter instead.
