# MSB3202

This article describes the MSB3202 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3202: The project file 'filename' was not found.`

## Description

The MSB3202 error occurs when MSBuild is unable to locate the specified project file. This error is generated when a build is invoked with an incorrect or missing project file path, or incorrect or missing dependent project file.

### Real-world scenarios

Here are some real-world scenarios that can produce this error, especially in modern development and CI/CD environments:

- **Incorrect file path in command line or build script**: When you invoke MSBuild, the specified project file path doesn't exist or is mistyped.

- **Project file renamed or deleted**: A project file was renamed or removed from the repository, but the build logic or one of the build inputs isn't updated to reflect the change.

- **Repository checkout issues**: During a CI/CD pipeline execution, the source code repository might not be fully checked out, or the necessary project file is excluded due to `.gitignore` rules or shallow cloning.

## Resolution

- Verify the project file exists at the specified location. Avoid ambiguity by using an absolute path to the project file, such as `msbuild C:\Projects\MySolution\MyProject.csproj`.

- Check for typos in the `ProjectReference` item in the project file. Confirm the path has no syntax issues like missing quotes for paths that include spaces.

- Ensure your version control system includes all necessary project files and the repository checkout is complete.

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
