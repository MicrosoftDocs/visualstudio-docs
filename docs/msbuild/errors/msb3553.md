# MSB3553

This article describes the MSB3553 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3553: Resource file 'name' has an invalid name.`

## Description

This error occurs when there's a problem with the name of a resource file.

## Resolution

Verify that the file extension corresponds to the file type (for example, `.resx`). Confirm the file doesn't contain any invalid characters as define by the operating system. Refer to your operating system documentation for characters that are invalid in a filename or path. For Windows, see [Naming a file](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions).

This error can also occur when file paths exceed the maximum path length. If you use long paths, check the Windows operating system `LongPathsEnabled` setting. For more information, see [Maximum file path limitation](/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
