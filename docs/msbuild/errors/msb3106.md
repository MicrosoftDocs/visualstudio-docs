# MSB3106 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3106 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3106: Assembly strong name 'assembly name' is either a path which could not be found or it is a full assembly name which is badly formed. If it is a full assembly name it may contain characters that need to be escaped with backslash(\). Those characters are Equals(=), Comma(,), Quote('), Apostrophe('), Backslash(\).`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

This error occurs when you have a `Reference` element with a path or assembly name, but the assembly couldn't be found with that path or name.

## Resolution

Check the assembly name in the `Reference` element for typos, and make sure it's valid with proper escaping, as the error text indicates.
