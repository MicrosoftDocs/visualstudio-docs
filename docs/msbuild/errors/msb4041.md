# MSB4041 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB4041 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB4041: The default XML namespace of the project must be the MSBuild XML namespace or no namespace. If the project is authored in the MSBuild 2003 format, please add xmlns='value' to the <Project> element. If the project has been authored in the old 1.0 or 1.2 format, please convert it to MSBuild 2003 format.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Remarks

This error is caused by an incorrect `xmlns` value in a project file. The `xmlns` attribute appears in older project files; it's no longer required. However, if it's present, it must be exactly as follows:

`xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003'`

Try deleting the `xmlns` attribute. Since the attribute is no longer required, deleting it should solve this issue.
