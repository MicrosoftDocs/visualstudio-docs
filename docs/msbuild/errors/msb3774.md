# MSB3774

This error occurs when MSBuild can't find the SDK referenced in the project file. MSBuild relies on user-extensible SDK resolvers to find SDKs. You get this error when a configured resolver could not find the requested SDK.

Check the project file and locate the root Project element, and check its `Sdk` attribute. For .NET projects, this value should be `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` or for NuGet, check the spelling of the package or feed name, and version number, and that the referenced NuGet feed is accessible or publicly available.

Check that the SDK is installed correctly. Check with the SDK provider to make sure that you are using the right name to reference the SDK.

See [How to use Project SDK](../how-to-use-project-sdk.md).
