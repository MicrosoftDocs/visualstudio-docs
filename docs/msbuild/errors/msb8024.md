# MSB8024

This article describes the MSB8024 error code.

## Message text

`MSB8024: Using static version of the C++ runtime library is not supported.`

## Description

This error occurs when the project can't use the static C++ runtime library. When you specify the **`/MT`** or **`/MTd`** (to use multithreaded runtime library) linker options, you must use the dynamic library version of the Universal C Runtime Library (UCRT). 

## Resolution

Modify the project to use the dynamic UCRT library. For more information, see [Upgrade your code to the Universal CRT](/cpp/porting/upgrade-your-code-to-the-universal-crt).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
