# MSB3721

This article describes the MSB3721 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3721: The command 'command' exited with code 'error-code'.`

## Description

This error occurs when a command launched in the build process exits with a nonzero error code.

## Resolution

Check the build output or build log to see if the custom build step produced an error with information about the problem. If not, try running the step separately to check for any problems or unexpected behavior.

If you can't see the exact command-line that failed, you can change the verbosity of the build output to show more detail.

The MSBuild command-line option is `-verbosity:{level}` or `-V:{level}`, where `{level}` is one of `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]` (the default), `d[etailed]`, or `diag[nostic]`. For more information, see [MSBuild command line reference](../msbuild-command-line-reference.md). For longer output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log `-bl` command-line switch with the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily.

You can also set the `MSBuildDebugEngine` environment variable to 1 to get all possible logs. For more information, see [Building MSBuild for the .NET Framework - Logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-Full-Framework-MSBuild.md#logs).

In Visual Studio, you can change the verbosity in **Tools** > **Options**, **Projects and Solutions**, **Build and Run**. For more information, see [View, save, and configure build log files](../../ide/how-to-view-save-and-configure-build-log-files.md#specify-data-verbosity-for-build-logs).
