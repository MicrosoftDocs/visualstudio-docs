# MSB6004 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB6004 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB6004: The specified task executable location 'path' is invalid.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when an executable for a task isn't found. An MSBuild task that runs a tool typically fails if there's an installation problem with the tool or package that provides the tool.

## Resolution

Check the executable to make sure it's installed at the expected path.

Look at the error that came from the tool associated with the MSBuild task, if any. For example, if the tool normally generates a log file, check the logs.

Check the installation of the package that provides the tool. For example, if the tool is a compiler, try reinstalling the compiler or package that provides the compiler. In this context, a package might mean a NuGet package, an OS package, a Visual Studio extension, or any other installed product.

Confirm the executable location is on the PATH environment variable, or that any other expected environment variables are set.

If your installation appears correct, check with the vendor that provides the tool to report the error.
