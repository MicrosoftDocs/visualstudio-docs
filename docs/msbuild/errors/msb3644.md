# MSB3644: The reference assemblies for 'FrameworkVersion' were not found

This error occurs when the .NET reference assemblies are not found for the version of .NET that a project requests. The issue could be that there is a problem with the project file, in that the version it is requesting is not recognized or not installed, or it could be an installation issue that the reference assemblies folder for that .NET version is not present or has been corrupted.

## Project file framework identifier and version

The first thing to check is that there are no spelling or typographical errors in the project file in the `TargetFramework`, `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`, or `TargetFrameworkVersion` properties. For example, the following code in project file generates MSB3644:

```xml
	<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)' == ''">
		<TargetFrameworkIdentifier>.NETCOREAPP</TargetFrameworkIdentifier>
		<TargetFrameworkVersion>3.1</TargetFrameworkVersion>
	</PropertyGroup>
```

The issue is that the `TargetFrameworkIdentifier` is misspelled. It should be `.NETCOREAPP`.

## Reference assemblies folder

Next, note the framework identifier and version requested in the `TargetFramework`, `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`, and `TargetFrameworkVersion` and look for the reference assembly folder for that version on the local drive.  For example, on Windows, the 32-bit reference assemblies for .NET Core should be under *C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\\.NETCore* and 64-bit .NET Framework reference assembly folders for should be under *C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\\.NETFramework*. If the folder for the version your project needs is not present or appears to be corrupted, you might need to install or reinstall that version. You can install the required version at [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/).
