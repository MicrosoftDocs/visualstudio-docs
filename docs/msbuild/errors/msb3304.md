# MSB3304

This article describes the MSB3304 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3304: Could not determine the dependencies of the COM reference 'reference'.`

## Description

This error is shown whenever there's an error that occurs when MSBuild scans a COM reference to attempt to resolve dependencies. The output shows another error message that provides more information on the failure.

## Resolution

Look to the extra error message to determine the cause of the problem.

If the added error message is from the type library importer, you can also try running the *tlbimp.exe* importer directly to get a more detailed error message. For more information, see [TlbImp.exe (Type Library Importer)](/dotnet/framework/tools/tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer) and [Add references to type libraries](/dotnet/framework/interop/how-to-add-references-to-type-libraries).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
