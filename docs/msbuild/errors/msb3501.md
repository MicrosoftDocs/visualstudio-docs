# MSB3501 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3501 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3501: Could not read lines from file 'filename'.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB3501: "}
-->
## Description

This error occurs when your project is using the [`ReadLinesFromFile` task](../readlinesfromfile-task.md), but the specified file wasn't found.

## Resolution

Check the input to the `ReadLinesFromFile` task. You can use the `-v:diag` switch on the MSBuild command line to get more detailed information about the MSBuild execution, such as the values of the input parameters provided to the `ReadLinesFromFile` task. In Visual Studio, in **Tools, Options, Build and Run**, set **Verbosity** to **Diagnostic**.

If the input comes from a property value, check that the property has a value. If it comes from a property set at the command line, check that the syntax of the command line are the value of the environment variable is correct, especially check shell escape characters and ensuring proper use of quotes, especially the need for quotes when providing filenames with spaces in the path. If the input file comes from an environment variable, check the spelling of the environment value and verify that it has the expected value.
