# MSB4019

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to import a file, but the file couldn't be found. The imported file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, or `.targets` file, or any other file that contains XML that is intended to be interpreted by MSBuild.

The full message resembles the following text:

```output
MSB4019: The imported project 'name' was not found. Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration 'declaration' is correct, and that the file exists on disk.
```

Check the syntax of the import declaration, check the path of the imported file, and make sure the spelling of the filename is correct.

See [Import element (MSBuild)](../import-element-msbuild.md).
