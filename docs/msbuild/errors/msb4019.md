# MSB4019

This article describes the MSB4019 error code.

## Message text

`MSB4019: The imported project 'name' was not found. Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration 'declaration' is correct, and that the file exists on disk.`

## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to import a file, but the file can't be found. The imported file must be an XML MSBuild file, such as a `.props` file, a `.targets` file, or any other file that contains XML intended for interpretation by MSBuild.

## Resolution

Check the syntax of the import declaration, and check the path of the imported file. Make sure the spelling of the filename is correct. For more information, see [Import element (MSBuild)](../import-element-msbuild.md).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
