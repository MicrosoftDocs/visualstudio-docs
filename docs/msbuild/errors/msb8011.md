<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->

This article describes the MSB8011 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB8011: Failed to register output. Please try enabling Per-user Redirection or register the component from a command prompt with elevated permissions.`

## Description

This error occurs when an attempt to register a component fails during the build.

A registration failure can occur for several reasons:

- Different permissions might be required for per-user or global registration, including elevated permissions. 
- Required DLL dependencies can't be found.
- Required DLL dependencies don't match the target architecture of the component. 
- Required `DllInstall` entry point isn't defined. 

## Resolution

Try running the IDE, developer command prompt, or the *`regsvr32.exe`* process with elevated permissions (Run as Administrator). 

Make sure to use dependencies built for the same architecture as your component. Place dependencies in the same directory as the component to enable registration. 

If your component requires a`DllInstall` entry point, make sure the entry point is defined. 

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
