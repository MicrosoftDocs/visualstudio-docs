# MSB3061

This diagnostic code is emitted when MSBuild tried to delete a file, but an error occurred and the file couldn't be deleted.

The full message is something like:

```output
MSB3061: Unable to delete file 'filename'.
```

Check that the file exists and is at the expected location, MSBuild has write permissions to the file and folder, the file isn't being used by another process, and that isn't a read-only file.
