# MSB3023 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3023 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3023: No destination specified for Copy. Please supply either 'DestinationFiles' or 'DestinationFolder'.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This occurs when an empty value is supplied in the project file (or one of its imports) for the destination of a copy operation. This is often because a property value was misspelled, resulting in an empty string instead of the expected value.

## Resolution

Check all properties in the project file used in the operation where the error occurs, and correct any misspellings or unintended inconsistencies. Make sure all properties used for destination files and folders have a value.

If the issue arises from system build files, it could be caused by a problem with some metadata. You can use the `-v:diag` switch on the MSBuild command line, or change the verbosity setting in Visual Studio (open **Tools**, **Options** and search for "verbosity"), to get more detailed output that might help determine where the error comes from.
