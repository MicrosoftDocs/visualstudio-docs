# MSB4211 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB4211 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB4211: The property 'value' is being set to a value for the first time, but it was already consumed at 'value'.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB4211: "}
-->

## Remarks

This error occurs when a target in an MSBuild project file attempts to use a property that wasn't initialized at the point it was used, but it's assigned a value later in the build process.

It's not an error to use an uninitialized property. Such an undefined property simply gets the empty string as a value, but if the property is later assigned a value, this error occurs.

If you want MSBuild to warn for any uninitialized property, set the environment variable `MSBUILDWARNONUNINITIALIZEDPROPERTY` to 1.

## Resolution

To resolve this error, ensure that the property in question is initialized before you use it. Since the property is given a value later, you might need to change the sequence of property settings or imports to ensure that the initialized occurs before reading the property's value.
