# MSB3187 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3187 diagnostic code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3187: Referenced assembly 'assembly-name' targets a different processor than the application.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This message is a warning, not an error. The question is whether the platform mismatch is intended or not. There are times when it might be intentional, for example, when you're targeting `Any CPU`, but you reference an assembly that targets a specific platform, you get this warning. Your app might not run successfully on some platforms, but for testing and development purposes, you might want to proceed anyway.

## Resolution

If the platform choice is intentional, you can disable the warning by using the `NoWarn` property:

`<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);MSB3187</NoWarn>`

Otherwise, use a different build of the assembly that references the correct platform, or change the target platform of your project.
