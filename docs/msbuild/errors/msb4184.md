# MSB4184

This error occurs if MSBuild can't interpret an expression found in a project file or an imported file.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by the exception text from the underlying code:

```output
The expression 'expression' cannot be evaluated.
```

For example, if the project file contains invalid elements or value, you might get this error.

Look to the exception message provided by the underlying code to determine the cause of the problem.

Check the syntax of the code that resulted in the error.
