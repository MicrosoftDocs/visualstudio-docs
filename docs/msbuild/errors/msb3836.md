# MSB3836

This article describes the MSB3836 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3836: The explicit binding redirect on 'assembly' conflicts with an autogenerated binding redirect. Consider removing it from the application configuration file or disabling autogenerated binding redirects. The build will replace it with: 'binding-redirect'.`

## Description

This error occurs when you explicitly specify a binding redirect, but a conflicting binding redirect is already automatically generated for the assembly. For more information about binding redirects, see [Redirect assembly versions](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/redirect-assembly-versions).

## Resolution

Look for a [bindingredirect element](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/bindingredirect-element) in the application configuration file (for example, *app.config*). The presence of this element can help you determine if your code explicitly specifies a binding redirect.

To disable autogenerated binding redirects, see [Enable or disable automatic binding redirection](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/how-to-enable-and-disable-automatic-binding-redirection).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
