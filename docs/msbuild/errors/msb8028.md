# MSB8028 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB8028 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB8028: The intermediate directory (*shared-intermediate-path*) contains files shared from another project (*intermediate-path*). This can lead to incorrect clean and rebuild behavior.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when two or more projects produce outputs to the same location. This issue can lead to an incorrect build result. The intermediate directories involved are *shared-intermediate-path* and *intermediate-path*.

## Resolution

For each project in your solution, set your `$(IntDir)` property for each supported configuration and platform, so it uses its own unique directory.

To set the intermediate file location, follow these steps:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project node, and select **Properties**.
1. In the **Property Pages** dialog for the project, select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page.
1. For each configuration in the project, set the **Intermediate Directory** property.
1. Select **OK** to save your changes.

Keep in mind that `$(IntDir)` is an MSBuild property (macro) that applies to the C++ build process. For more information, see [Common macros for MSBuild commands and properties](/cpp/build/reference/common-macros-for-build-commands-and-properties).
