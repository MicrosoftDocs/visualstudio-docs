This article describes the MSB3103 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3103: Invalid Resx file.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when there's an issue with a `.resx` resource file. This error indicates that the `.resx` file can't be properly read or processed, often due to incorrect file paths or references. 

### Common causes

The following causes can result in this error:

| Cause | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Missing or inaccessible resources** | The `.resx` file references external resources (for example, images or files) that aren't present in the expected location or are inaccessible. | A file path specified in the `.resx` file is incorrect or points to a missing file. |
| **Incorrect type reference** | The `.resx` file referenced a type that can't be found. | A typo in a type reference in a ResXFile reference, or a type that isn't available for some reason. |
| **Corrupted files** | The `.resx` file or one of its dependencies is corrupted. | The `.resx` file contains unreadable characters and the build isn't able to process the file. |

### Real-world scenarios

Here are some real-world scenarios that can lead to this error:

- **Project migration**: Upgrading a legacy project from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 6+ where existing `.resx` files contain elements or attributes that aren't compatible with the newer frameworks.

- **Manual edits to .resx files**: Manual edits to `.resx` files that inadvertently introduce syntax errors or invalid data.

- **Broken resource links**: References to external files (for example, images or icons) in `.resx` files where the files aren't included in the project or accessible during the build.

- **Corrupted .resx files**: Files are corrupted due to version control conflicts or file encoding changes.
 
## Resolution

- **Check resource entries**: If external resources are referenced, verify their paths and existence.

- **Use the ResX Resource Manager**: Consider using tools like [ResX Resource Manager](https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager) to validate and manage `.resx` files.

- **Update for framework compatibility**: Review changes in resource handling for the target framework. Update `.resx` files to align with the requirements of the new framework.

- **Revert to a known good state**: If the `.resx` file is corrupted, revert to a previous version from source control.
