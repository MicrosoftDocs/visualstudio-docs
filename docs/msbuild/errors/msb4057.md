# MSB4057 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB4057 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB4057: The target 'target name' does not exist in the project.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when a target can't be found, but the target is referenced in a project file, such as through the `CallTarget`, `BeforeTargets`, `AfterTargets`, or `DependsOnTarget` property.

## Resolution

Confirm the target is present in the project file or its imports, and check for spelling errors. Check the logic of conditions to make sure the target is included under the relevant conditions.

If the target is an individual project build within a nested solution in a Visual Studio Solution folder, and you reference the target with the command-line option `-targets` or `-t`, confirm the file containing the target is properly referenced. Be sure to reference the target by the solution folder name and not the name of the folder on disk.
