# MSB3075

This article describes the MSB3075 error code.

## Message text

`The command 'name' exited with code 'error-code'. Please verify that you have sufficient rights to run this command`

## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild isn't running with sufficient privileges to run a particular command.

## Resolution

You might be tempted to run MSBuild or Visual Studio as Administrator to resolve the issue, but that isn't usually necessary.

Check the executable listed in the error message and make sure it allows execute permissions.

The error can occur in projects that write to the registry, which usually requires elevated privileges. If you are building a C++ project, enabling [Per-user Redirection](/cpp/build/reference/linker-property-pages#per-user-redirection) in the Linker settings might solve the issue.

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
