# MSB3101

This error occurs when MSBuild failed to write an internal file during a build. This error is not necessarily a blocking error, as MSBuild can sometimes recover from it and continue processing the build.

The message resembles the following, but this text is followed by additional information from the operating system:

```output
MSB3101: Could not write state file 'filename'
```

Look to the additional information provided by the operating system to determine the cause of the problem. Typical issues include: the path was too long, permission was denied to the folder, a file was locked by another process, or the disk was full.
