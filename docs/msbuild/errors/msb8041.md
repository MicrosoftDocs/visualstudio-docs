# MSBuild error MSB8041

> MSB8041: MFC/ATL Libraries are required for this project.

This error occurs when MFC or ATL is required for a build, but it wasn't found.

To fix the error, make sure the right version of MFC or ATL is installed. Open the Visual Studio Installer, choose **Modify**, and choose a version of the required library under **Individual Components**. Make sure the version and architecture of MFC you install matches the expected by the project you're building. There's a version of MFC for each version of the C++ build tools. For example, **C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 and x64)**.  If you simply want to use the latest tools, you need **C++ MFC for latest build tools** for non-Spectre builds and **C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools with Spectre Mitigations** for Spectre builds. Choose the correct option for your target platform architecture. The others are for cases where you're specifically targeting an earlier toolset. For more information, see [MFC Library Versions](/cpp/mfc/mfc-library-versions).

More specifically, this error is triggered in the C++ build process in the MSBuild target *Microsoft.CppBuild.targets* when the following file isn't found: *$(VCToolsInstallDir)atlmfc\lib\$(_SpectreLibsDir)$(PlatformShortName)\mfcs140.lib*. The properties come from the environment (`VCToolsInstallDir`) and the project configuration: `_SpectreLibsDir` is empty or *spectre\\*, `PlatformShortName` is x86, x64, arm, arm64, or arm64EC.

For information about modifying Visual Studio to install the binaries you need, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md).
