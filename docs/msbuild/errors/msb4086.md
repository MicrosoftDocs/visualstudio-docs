# MSB4086

This article describes the MSB4086 error code.

## Message text

`MSB4086: A numeric comparison was attempted on 'expression' that evaluates to 'value' instead of a number, in condition 'condition'.`

## Description

This error occurs in an MSBuild project file when a number is expected in a condition expression, but the expression evaluated to a non-numeric value.

## Resolution

If the error occurs in your project file, check the project file for syntax errors and other problems. For more information about the syntax, see [MSBuild conditions](../msbuild-conditions.md).

Review the MSBuild properties and confirm you're using them as expected. Check the properties in the condition expression, especially properties with a numeric value, and confirm the values are numeric and use the correct syntax.

### Check numeric values

This error can also be generated if there's a problem with setting a numeric value. The root cause might be another error, such as an installation issue. For example, if a version number of an installed tool is used in a condition expression, but the tool isn't installed.

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
