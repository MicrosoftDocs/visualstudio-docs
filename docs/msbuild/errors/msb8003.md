# MSB8003 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB8003 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB8003: The *property-name* property is not defined. Some build tools may not be found.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when a build property isn't defined.

Common causes for this error include:

- The `VCToolsInstallDir` property isn't set.
- The `WindowsSDKDir` property isn't set in your project.
- A C++ workload isn't installed with the Visual Studio Installer. 

## Resolution

Define a supported value for the specified property, such as the `VCToolsInstallDir` or `WindowsSDKDir` property.

Use the Visual Studio Installer to install workloads and optional components. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Choose one of the C++ workloads and install the C/C++ toolset. Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platforms, libraries, and SDKs.

Since Visual Studio 2015, the Windows SDK hosts the headers and libraries for the C runtime library. We recommend you install and use the latest available Windows SDK in the Visual Studio Installer, and set the **Windows SDK Version** property in your project property pages to match.
