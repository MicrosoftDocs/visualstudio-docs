# MSBuild error MSB8053

> MSB8053: `/clr` (common language runtime) not supported by clang-cl.

This error occurs when you specify the [`/clr` (Common Language Runtime)](/cpp/build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation) option in a C++ Clang project. This option requires the MSVC Compiler, *`cl.exe`*.
