# MSB8013 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->

This article describes the MSB8013 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB8013: This project doesn't contain the Configuration and Platform combination specified.`

## Description

This error occurs when the project doesn't contain the configuration and platform combination specified (*configuration*|*platform*), as in `Release|Win32`.

The problem can occur when another project tries to follow a project-to-project reference to this project, but this project is unloaded or not included in the solution. The referencing project can't build by using the same or equivalent configuration or platform as expected.

## Resolution

If your project tries to reference another project that isn't loaded, remove the project reference and readd it. You can also add the referenced project to the solution as a build dependency instead of a reference.

Check if the build encounters an unexpected configuration and platform, such as `Debug|Win32` rather than `Release|Win32`. The build system uses the default values when the actual values aren't preserved. Set the specific configuration and platform values your project requires. Then, build your project before another referencing project builds.

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
