# MSB4064

This error occurs when a task is invoked with a parameter that is not compatible with the task.

The full message resembles the following text:

```output
MSB4064: The 'parameter name' parameter is not supported by the 'task name' task loaded from assembly: 'assembly' from the path: 'path'. Verify that the parameter exists on the task, the UsingTask points to the correct assembly, and it is a settable public instance property.
```

Check the project file or imported file for the invocation of the task, and examine the arguments provided.

Check the documentation for the task for more information about the expected parameters, including which parameters are required, and which are optional.

See [MSBuild tasks](../msbuild-tasks.md).
