# MSB5029 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB5029 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB5029: The value 'value' of the 'value' attribute in element 'value' in file 'value' is a wildcard that results in enumerating all files on the drive, which was likely not intended. Check that referenced properties are always defined and that the project and current working directory are not at the drive root.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB5029: "}UE: This is a generic message that is displayed when we find a project element that has a drive enumerating wildcard value for one of its
      attributes e.g. <Compile Include="$(NotAlwaysDefined)\**\*.cs"> -- if the property is undefined, the value of Include should not result in enumerating all files on drive.
-->
## Description

This error occurs when a project element that has a drive enumerating wildcard value for one of its attributes. For example, `<Compile Include="$(NotAlwaysDefined)\**\*.cs"`. If the property is undefined, the value of `Include` would result in enumerating all files on the drive. To avoid this unintended performance issue, MSBuild gives this error.

## Resolution

You could define a default value for the property, or change the wildcard expression to more narrowly scope the search for the files you intend.
