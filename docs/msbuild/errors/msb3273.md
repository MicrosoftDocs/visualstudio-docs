# MSB3273 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3273 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`Unknown processor architecture. The implementation file "filename" for "WinMD file" had an ImageFileMachine value of "hex value". If you wish to use this implementation file make sure the "ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch" property in your project is set to "Warning" or "None".`

## Description

The WinMD file is the Windows Metadata file, which contains type information for UWP or WinRT applications that enables language projection. See [WinMD files](/uwp/winrt-cref/winmd-files). The <xref:System.Reflection.ImageFileMachine> refers to an enumeration value that indicates the platform architecture.

A typical reason for the error is when there's a conflict between your platform architecture for an assembly and its dependencies, such as when your assembly's architecture is set to `AnyCPU` but you have a platform-specific (say `x86`) dependency.

## Resolution

As suggested in the error text, you can change this error into a warning. You can do that by setting the property `ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch` to `Warning` or `None`.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
   <!-- other property settings -->
   <ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>None</ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If you use this technique to suppress the error, your code must ensure that dependencies are never loaded in a context where they would run on the wrong architecture.
