# MSB3303

This article describes the MSB3303 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3303: Could not resolve COM reference 'reference' version 'version'.`

## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild fails to generate a .NET assembly (Primary Interop Assembly or PIA) for the COM reference.

## Resolution

The standard output message text is followed by additional information from the operating system. Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem.

If the subsequent error message is from the type library importer, you can also try running the *tlbimp.exe* importer directly to get a more detailed error message. For more information, see [TlbImp.exe (Type Library Importer)](/dotnet/framework/tools/tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer) and [Add references to type libraries](/dotnet/framework/interop/how-to-add-references-to-type-libraries).

## Applies to

All versions of MSBuild
