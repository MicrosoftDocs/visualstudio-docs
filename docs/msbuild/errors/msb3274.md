## Description

This error occurs in .NET Framework projects when the version of a reference is higher than the version you're currently building for.

## Resolution

Consider targeting a more recent version of the .NET Framework. For instance, if your project targets .NET Framework 4.7.2, you might see this error if you reference a NuGet package or another project that targets .NET Framework 4.8.

In Visual Studio, check the **Target framework** in the project's property pages. For more information, see [Framework targeting overview](../../ide/visual-studio-multi-targeting-overview.md#change-the-target-framework).

In a project file, you can set the target framework as follows:

```xml
<TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.0</TargetFrameworkVersion>
```

To suppress this error, you can set the following MSBuild property:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ResolveAssemblyReferenceIgnoreTargetFrameworkAttributeVersionMismatch>true</ResolveAssemblyReferenceIgnoreTargetFrameworkAttributeVersionMismatch>
</PropertyGroup>
```

For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

For more information, see [MSBuild target framework and target platform](../msbuild-target-framework-and-target-platform.md) and [Source code](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/d0af670c220f48693d5f1e4bab126d4367d77e05/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L2440).
