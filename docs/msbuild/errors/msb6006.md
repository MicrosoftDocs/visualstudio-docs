# MSB6006

This error occurs when a command is executed and returns a non-zero exit code, or otherwise indicates an error in its output.

```output
'process' exited with code `exit code`
```

Look to the output of the command to determine the root cause of the failure. If logging was enabled in the build, the output might be written to the build log. See [View, save, and configure build logs](../../ide/how-to-view-save-and-configure-build-log-files.md) and [Obtaining build logs with MSBuild](../obtaining-build-logs-with-msbuild.md).

To diagnose the error, first enable a diagnostic log (use the `-verbosity:diag` command-line switch), and check the MSBuild log file with the full diagnostics output. For bigger output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log (`-bl` command-line switch) and the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily. 

You can also set the `MSBuildDebugEngine` environment variable to 1 to get all possible logs. See [Building MSBuild for the .NET Framework - Logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-Full-Framework-MSBuild.md#logs).

It might be helpful to reproduce the error in isolation. Try running the tool separately with the same inputs and command-line arguments that MSBuild used in the build. If symbols are available and you have a Debug build of the tool, you can try attaching a debugger to the tool and debug the tool itself to see what the problem is.
