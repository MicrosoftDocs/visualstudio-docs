> Job history submitted to Linux VMs is stored on the VM in the /tmp directory. Therefore, whenever it is rebooted the job history is cleared. For a permanent record of your job history, please configure your VM as a compute context in Azure Machine learning, then Submit Job to Azure Machine Learning (selecting your VM as the compute context).
