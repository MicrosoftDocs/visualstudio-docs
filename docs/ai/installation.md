This includes making sure the latest drivers and libraries for your NVIDIA GPU (if you have one). You should also ensure you have installed Python and Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and appropriate deep learning frameworks such as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), TensorFlow, Caffe2, MXNet, Keras, Theano, PyTorch and/or Chainer that you plan to use in your project.

> [!NOTE]
> Software introduction in the following subsections is excerpted from their homepages.

### NVIDIA GPU driver

Deep learning frameworks take advantage of NVIDIA GPU to let machines learn at a speed, accuracy, and scale towards true artificial intelligence. If your computer has NVIDIA GPU cards, please visit [here](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or try OS update to install the latest driver.

### CUDA

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA.
It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.
Currently, CUDA Toolkit 8.0 is required by deep learning frameworks.

To install CUDA

- Visit this [site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive), download CUDA and install it.
- Make sure to install the CUDA runtime libraries, and then add CUDA binary path to the %PATH% or $Path environment variable.
- On Windows, this path is "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin" by default.

### cuDNN

[cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks by NVIDIA. cuDNN v6 is required by latest deep learning frameworks.

To install cuDNN:

- Visit [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) to download and install the latest package.
- Ensure to add the directory containing cuDNN binary to the %PATH% or $Path environment variable.
- On Windows, you can copy cudnn64_6.dll to "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin".

> [!NOTE]
> Previous deep learning frameworks such as CNTK 2.0 and TensorFlow 1.2.1 need cuDNN v5.1. However, you can install multiple cuDNN versions together.

### Python

Python has been the primary programming language for deep learning applications. **64-bit** Python distribution is required, and [Python 3.5.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/) is recommended for the best compatibility.

### To install Python on Windows

- We suggest installing the Python launcher for yourself only, and add Python to the %PATH% environment variable.
- Ensure to install pip, which is the package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python.

Deep learning frameworks rely on pip for their own installation.

Install Python on Windows

Then, we need to verify whether Python 3.5 is installed correctly, and upgrade pip to the latest version by executing the following commands in a terminal:

- **Windows**
    ```cmd
    C:\Users\test>python -V
    Python 3.5.4

    C:\Users\test>pip3.5 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from c:\users\test\appdata\local\programs\python\python35\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)

    C:\Users\test>python -m pip install -U pip
    ```

- **macOS**
    ```bash
    MyMac:~ test$ python3.5 -V
    Python 3.5.4

    MyMac:~ test$ pip3.5 -V
    pip 9.0.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

    MyMac:~ test$ python3.5 -m pip install -U pip
    ```

### Python on Visual Studio

Python is fully supported in Visual Studio through extensions.
Learn more about install [Python for Visual Studio Tools](../python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio.md) for more details.

### NumPy and SciPy

- **NumPy** is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional arrays.

- **SciPy** (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering, depending on NumPy. Starting from version 1.0.0, SciPy now has official prebuilt wheel package for Windows.

To install NumPy and SciPy, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
pip3.5 install -U numpy scipy
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above command upgrades existing old or unofficial (e.g. third-party packages from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ for Windows) NumPy and SciPy to the latest official ones.

### Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)

The [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://cntk.ai) is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. CNTK supports both Python and BrainScript programming languages.

> [!NOTE]
> CNTK currently does not support macOS.

To install CNTK Python package, see [how to install CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine)
