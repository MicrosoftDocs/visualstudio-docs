# DA0004: High processor usage

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|Rule Id|DA0004|
|Category|Profiling Tools Usage|
|Profiling methods|Instrumentation<br /><br /> Sampling|
|Message|Your processor usage is consistently above 75%. Consider using Sampling mode for CPU-bound applications.|
|Rule type|Information|

 When you profile by using the sampling, .NET memory, or resource contention methods, you must collect at least 10 samples to trigger this rule.

## Cause
 Processor (CPU) utilization was high in profiling data that was collected using the instrumentation method. Consider using the sampling profiling method when profiling a CPU bound application.

## Rule description
 During this profiling run, the processor (or processors) was consistently busy. High CPU utilization can indicate a CPU-bound application. Instrumented profiles are not the most effective way to investigate CPU-usage scenarios. Sampling is more effective when you are profiling applications that spend much of their time executing instructions on the processor.

## How to fix violations
 Consider profiling your application again using the sampling method instead of instrumentation method unless you require function timings or you are more interested in understanding input/output than processor bottlenecks.
