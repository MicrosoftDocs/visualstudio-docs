# How to: Create a profiling tools ETW report
The Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) report lists the ETW events that are recorded in a performance session of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools. ETW data is collected in a binary (.*etl*) file. For more information about this report, see [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) report](../profiling/event-tracing-for-windows-etw-report.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot display ETW reports in the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

- For information about how to collect ETW data by using the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [How to: Collect Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) data](../profiling/how-to-collect-event-tracing-for-windows-etw-data.md).

- For information about how to collect ETW data from a command prompt, see [VSPerfCmd](../profiling/vsperfcmd.md) and [Events](../profiling/events-vsperfcmd.md).

  You generate the ETW report by using the **VSReport/summary:etw** command. The .*etl* that contains the ETW data must be in the same directory as the profiling data (.*vsp* or .*vsps*) file. By default, the report is generated as a comma-separated value (.*csv*) file. For more information, see [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md).

### To generate an ETW report

- In a **Command Prompt** window, type the following command line:

     *ToolsPath* **VSPerfReport** *VSPFile*  **/Summary:ETW [/Xml]**

    |Item|Description|
    |-|-|
    |*ToolsPath*|The path of the Profiling Tools utility. For more information, see [Specify the path to command-line tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).|
    |*VSPFile*|The profiling data (.*vsp* or .*vsps*) file. Full and partial paths are accepted.|
    |Xml|Generates a report that is formatted in XML.|
