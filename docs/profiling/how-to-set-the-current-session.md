# How to: Set the current session

You can open multiple performance sessions in the **Performance Explorer**, and can then select one of the visible performance sessions to be set as the current session.

After you set a session as the current session, clicking **Launch** on the **Performance Explorer** toolbar will start profiling the current session.

## To set current performance session

- In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session, and then click **Set as Current Session**.

     The session name appears in bold.
