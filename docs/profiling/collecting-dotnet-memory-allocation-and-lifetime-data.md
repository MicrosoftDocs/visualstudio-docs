# Collect .NET memory allocation and lifetime data

Visual Studio Profiling Tools support the collection of .NET memory allocation and object lifetime data, which helps you detect memory-related performance issues in your application.

- Data about .NET memory allocation includes the size and number of .NET Framework memory objects that were allocated.

- Object lifetime data includes the size and number of .NET Framework memory objects that were reclaimed in the three garbage collection generations.

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. UWP apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).

You can collect data by using either the sampling or the instrumentation profiling method.

- When you use the sampling method, the profiler tracks all .NET memory allocations and objects that are generated by the process that was started or attached to.

- When you use the instrumentation method, the profiler tracks only those .NET memory allocations and objects that are generated by the instrumented modules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are collecting .NET memory data (allocations, object lifetimes, or both) by using the sampling method, all user-specified sampling events are ignored, and the appropriate memory allocation events are used to collect data.

If you enable the profiling of.NET memory allocation, you also enable the Allocation View. If you enable the profiling of .NET lifetime data, you also enable the Objects Lifetime View. For more information, see [Allocations View](../profiling/dotnet-memory-allocations-view.md) and [Object Lifetime View](../profiling/object-lifetime-view.md).

For information about how to collect .NET memory data by using the Profiling Tools command-line tools, see Using .NET Memory Methods to Collect Memory Allocation and Object Lifetime Data in [Using Profiling Methods From the Command Line](../profiling/using-profiling-methods-to-collect-performance-data-from-the-command-line.md).

## To collect .NET memory data

1. In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session, and then click **Properties**.

2. On the *Performance Session* **Property Pages** dialog box, click the **General** tab, and select the **Collect .NET object allocation information** check box.

3. To collect .NET object lifetime data, select the **Also collect .NET object lifetime information** check box.

## Common tasks

You can specify additional options in the _Performance Session_**Property Pages** dialog box of the performance session. To open this dialog box:

- In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session name, and then click **Properties**.

The tasks in the following table describe options that you can specify in the _Performance Session_**Property Pages** dialog box when you collect .NET memory data.
