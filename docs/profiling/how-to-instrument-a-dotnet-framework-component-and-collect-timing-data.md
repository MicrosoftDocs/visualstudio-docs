# How to: Instrument a stand-alone .NET Framework component and collect timing data with the profiler from the command line
This topic describes how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools command-line tools to instrument a .NET Framework component such as an .*exe* or .*dll* file, and to collect detailed timing data.

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. UWP apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).

> To get the path to the profiling tools, see [Specify the path to command line tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md). On 64-bit computers, both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the tools are available. To use the profiler command-line tools, you must add the tools path to the PATH environment variable of the Command Prompt window or add it to the command itself.

> Adding tier interaction data to a profiling run requires specific procedures with the command line profiling tools. See [Collect tier interaction data](../profiling/adding-tier-interaction-data-from-the-command-line.md).

 To collect detailed timing data from a .NET Framework component by using the instrumentation method, you use the [VSInstr.exe](../profiling/vsinstr.md) tool to generate an instrumented version of the component and the [VSPerfCLREnv.cmd](../profiling/vsperfclrenv.md) tool to initialize profiling environment variables. You then start the profiler.

 When the instrumented component is executed, timing data is automatically collected to a data file. You can pause and resume data collection during the profiling session.

 To end a profiling session, you close the target application and explicitly shut down the profiler. In most cases, we recommend clearing the profiling environment variables at the end of a session.

## Start the profiling session

#### To start profiling by using the instrumentation method

1. Open a Command Prompt window. If necessary, add the profiler tools directory to your PATH environment variable. The path is not added at installation.

2. Use the **VSInstr** tool to generate an instrumented version of the target application.

3. Initialize the .NET Framework profiling environment variables. Type:

    **VSPerfClrEnv /traceon**

4. Start the profiler. Type:

    **VSPerfCmd /start:trace /output:** `OutputFile` [`Options`]

   - The [/start](../profiling/start.md)**:trace** option initializes the profiler.

   - The [/output](../profiling/output.md)**:**`OutputFile` option is required with **/start**. `OutputFile` specifies the name and location of the profiling data (.vsp) file.

     You can use any one of the following options with the **/start:trace** option.

   | Option | Description |
   | - | - |
   | [/user](../profiling/user-vsperfcmd.md) **:**[`Domain`**\\**]`UserName` | Specifies the domain and user name of the account that owns the profiled process. This option is required only if the process is running as a user other than the logged-on user. The process owner is listed in the **User Name** column on the **Processes** tab of Windows Task Manager. |
   | [/crosssession](../profiling/crosssession.md) | Enables profiling of processes in other sessions. This option is required if the ASP.NET application is running in a different session. The session idenitifier is listed in the **Session ID** column on the **Processes** tab of Windows Task Manager. **/CS** can be specified as an abbreviation for **/crosssession**. |
   | [/globaloff](../profiling/globalon-and-globaloff.md) | Starts the profiler with data collection paused. Use [/globalon](../profiling/globalon-and-globaloff.md) to resume profiling. |
   | [/counter](../profiling/counter.md) **:** `Config` | Collects information from the processor performance counter that is specified in `Config`. Counter information is added to the data that is collected at each profiling event. |
   | [/wincounter](../profiling/wincounter.md) **:** `WinCounterPath` | Specifies a Windows performance counter to be collected during profiling. |
   | [/automark](../profiling/automark.md) **:** `Interval` | Use with **/wincounter** only. Specifies the number of milliseconds between Windows performance counter collection events. Default is 500 ms. |
   | [/events](../profiling/events-vsperfcmd.md) **:** `Config` | Specifies an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event to be collected during profiling. ETW events are collected in a separate (.*etl*) file. |

5. Start the target application from the Command Prompt window.

## Control data collection
 When the target application is running, you can control data collection by starting and stopping the writing of data to the profiler data file by using *VSPerfCmd.exe* options. Controlling data collection enables you to collect data for a specific part of program execution, such as starting or shutting down the application.

#### To start and stop data collection

- The following pairs of options start and stop data collection. Specify each option on a separate command line. You can turn data collection on and off multiple times.

    |Option|Description|
    |------------|-----------------|
    |[/globalon /globaloff](../profiling/globalon-and-globaloff.md)|Starts (**/globalon**) or stops (**/globaloff**) data collection for all processes.|
    |[/processon](../profiling/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** `PID` [/processoff](../profiling/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** `PID`|Starts (**/processon**) or stops (**/processoff**) data collection for the process specified by the process ID (`PID`).|
    |[/threadon](../profiling/threadon-and-threadoff.md) **:** `TID` [/threadoff](../profiling/threadon-and-threadoff.md) **:** `TID`|Starts (**/threadon**) or stops (**/threadoff**) data collection for the thread specified by the thread ID (`TID`).|

## End the profiling session
 To end a profiling session, close the application that is running the instrumented component. Call the **VSPerfCmd** [/shutdown](../profiling/shutdown.md) option to turn off the profiler and close the profiling data file. The **VSPerfClrEnv /off** command clears the profiling environment variables.

#### To end a profiling session

1. Close the target application.

2. Shut down the profiler. Type:

     **VSPerfCmd /shutdown**

3. (Optional) Clear the profiling environment variables. Type:

     **VSPerfClrEnv /off**
