# Collect tier interaction data

Tier interaction profiling provides additional information about the execution times of functions of multi-tiered applications that communicate with databases through ADO.NET services. Data is collected only for synchronous function calls.

**Visual Studio editions**

Tier interaction profiling data can be collected using any edition of Visual Studio. However, tier interaction profiling data can be viewed only in Visual Studio Enterprise.

**Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012**

To collect tier interaction data on Windows 8 desktop apps and Windows Server 2012 apps, you must use the instrumentation method. You cannot collect tier interaction data for UWP apps. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md). You can include tier interaction data in all profiling methods on other supported version of Windows.

**Performance Wizard**

Because of a bug in the Performance Wizard, you must add the tier interaction data collection option to a profiling run from the Performance Explorer. You must also add the project, executable, or website to the Target node of Performance Explorer.

## To add tier interaction data to a profiling run by using the performance session property pages

1. In Performance Explorer, choose **Properties** from the context menu.

2. Select **Tier Interactions** page and then check the **Enable tier interaction profiling** check box.

3. In Performance Explorer, select the **Targets** node, and then specify the project, executable, or web site that you want to profile.
