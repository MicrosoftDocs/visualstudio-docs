# How to: Reference Windows symbol information
The Visual Studio Profiling Tools use symbol (.*pdb*) files to resolve symbolic names such as function names in program binaries. You can follow these steps to automatically download and update the correct .*pdb* files for the version of Windows on the local computer.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting does not affect existing reports. Only reports created after specifying the symbol server will have the symbol information.

 For more information, see [Specify symbol (.*pdb*) and source files](../debugger/specify-symbol-dot-pdb-and-source-files-in-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).

### To use the Microsoft symbol server

1. Create a folder to contain the symbol file information, such as C:\SymbolCache.

2. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.

     The **Options** dialog box appears.

3. Expand the **Debugging** tree, and then click **Symbols**.

4. In the **Symbol file (.pdb) locations**, select **Microsoft Symbol Servers**

5. In the **Cache symbols from the symbol server to this directory**, type the path of the folder that was created in step 1, for example:

     **C:\SymbolCache**

     You can also click the ellipsis button (**...**) and then select a directory from the **Browse for Folder** dialog box.
