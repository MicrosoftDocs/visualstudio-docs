# Create profiler reports from the command line
The **VSPerfReport** command-line tool enables you to create .*xml* or comma-separated value (.*csv*) reports from profiling data (.*vsp*) files. VSPerfReport report types closely match the table-based views of the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. You can filter the report to show only your code and to show only a segment of the profiling data file. For more information, see [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md).

 You can also make your profiling data files easier to share by embedding symbols in the .*vsp* files and by creating pre-analyzed report (.*vsps*) files that are smaller and quicker to open.
