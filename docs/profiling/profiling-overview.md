# Overview of profiling in Visual Studio

Profiling and diagnostics tools help you diagnose memory and CPU usage and other application-level issues. With these tools, you accumulate data (such as variable values, function calls, and events) over a period of time such as the time that you run your application. You can view the state of your application at different points during the execution of your code, or perform a post-mortem analysis of your application performance.

## Next steps

* [Profiling feature tour](../profiling/profiling-feature-tour.md) to learn about the many different ways to measure application performance.

* [Analyze CPU usage](../profiling/cpu-usage.md) for more in-depth information on the CPU usage tool.

* [Analyze memory usage](../profiling/memory-usage.md)to identify performance bottlenecks.
