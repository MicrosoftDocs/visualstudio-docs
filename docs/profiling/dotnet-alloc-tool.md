# Analyze memory usage by using the .NET Object Allocation tool

You can see how much memory your app uses and what code paths allocate the most memory by using the .NET Object Allocation tool.

After running the tool, you can see the function execution paths where objects are being allocated. You can then trace back to the root of the call tree that is taking up the most memory.

## Setup

1. Select **Alt+F2** to open the performance profiler in Visual Studio.

1. Select the **.NET Object Allocation Tracking** check box.

   ![The Dotnet Object Allocation Tracking tool selected](../profiling/media/dotnetalloctoolselected.png "The Dotnet Object Allocation Tracking tool selected")

1. Select the **Start** button to run the tool.

1. After the tool starts running, go through the scenario you want to profile in your app. Then select **Stop collection** or close your app to see your data.

   ![A window showing Stop collection](../profiling/media/stopcollectionlighttheme.png "A window showing Stop collection")

1. Select the **Allocation** tab. Window contents similar to the following screenshot appear.

   ![The Allocation tab](../profiling/media/allocationview.png "The Allocation tab")

You can now analyze the memory allocation of the objects.

During collection, the tracking tool can slow down the profiled app. If performance of the tracking tool or the app is slow, and if you don't need to track every object, you can adjust the sampling rate. To do so, select the gear symbol next to the tracking tool in the profiler summary page.

![Settings for the Dotnet Allocation tool](../profiling/media/dotnetallocsettings.png "Settings for the Dotnet Allocation tool")

Adjust the sampling rate to the rate you want. This change helps speed up performance of your app during collection and analysis.

For more information on how to make the tool more efficient, see [Optimizing Profiler settings](../profiling/optimize-profiler-settings.md).

## Understand your data

![A graph for the Dotnet Allocation tool](../profiling/media/graphdotnetalloc.png "A graph for the Dotnet Allocation tool")

In the preceding graphical view, the top graph shows the number of live objects in your app. The bottom **Object delta** graph shows the percentage change of app objects. Red bars denote when garbage collection took place.

![A filtered graph of the Dotnet Allocation time](../profiling/media/graphdotnetalloctimefiltered.png "A filtered graph of the Dotnet Allocation time")

You can filter the tabular data to display activity for only a specified time range. You can also zoom into or out of the graph.

### Allocation

![The Allocation view expanded](../profiling/media/allocationexpandedlight.png "The Allocation view expanded")

The **Allocation** view shows the location of objects that are allocating memory and how much memory those objects are allocating.

- The **Type** column is a list of classes and structures that take up memory. Double-click a type to view its backtrace as an inverted call tree. In the **Allocation** view only, you can see items within the selected category that take up memory.

- The **Allocations** column shows the number of objects that take up memory within a particular allocation type or function. This column appears only in the **Allocation**, **Call Tree**, and **Functions** views.

- The **Bytes** and **Average Size (Bytes)** columns don't appear by default. To show them, right-click the **Type** or **Allocations** column, and then select the **Bytes** and **Average Size (Bytes)** options to add them to the chart. 

   The two columns are similar to **Total (Allocations)** and **Self (Allocations)**, except they show the amount of memory taken up instead of the number of objects taking up memory. These columns appear only in the **Allocation** view.

- The **Module name** column shows the module that contains the function or process that is calling.

All of these columns are sortable. For the **Type** and **Module Name** columns, you can sort items alphabetically in either ascending or descending order. For **Allocations**, **Bytes** and **Average Size (Bytes)**, you can sort items by increasing or decreasing numeric value.

#### Symbols

The following symbols appear in the **Allocation**, **Call Tree**, and **Functions** tabs:

- ![The value type symbol](../profiling/media/valuetypeicon.png "The value type symbol") - A value type like integer

- ![The value-type collection symbol](../profiling/media/valuetypecollectionicon.png "The value-type collection symbol") - A value-type collection like array of integers

- ![The reference type symbol](../profiling/media/referencetypeicon.png "The reference type symbol") - A reference type like string

- ![The reference-type collection symbol](../profiling/media/referencetypecollectionicon.png "The reference-type collection symbol") - A reference-type collection like array of strings

### Call Tree

![The Call Tree view](../profiling/media/calltreelight.png "The Call Tree view")

The **Call Tree** view shows the function execution paths that contain objects allocating much memory.

- The **Function Name** column shows the process or name of the function containing objects that allocate memory. The display is based on the level of the node you're inspecting.
- The **Total (Allocations)** and **Total Size (Bytes)** columns show the number of allocated objects and the amount of memory that is used by a function and all other functions it calls.
- The **Self (Allocations)** and **Self-Size (Bytes)** columns show the number of allocated objects and the amount of memory that is used by a single selected function or allocation type.
- The **Average Size (Bytes)** column shows the same information as it does in the **Allocations** view.
- The **Module name** column shows the module that contains the function or process that is calling.

   ![A hot path expanded](../profiling/media/hotpathlight.png "A hot path expanded")

- The **Expand Hot Path** button highlights a function execution pathway that contains many objects that are allocating memory. The algorithm starts at a node you select and highlights the path of the most allocations, guiding you in your investigation.
- The **Show Hot Path** button shows or hides the flame symbols that indicate which nodes are part of the hot path.

### Functions

![The Functions view](../profiling/media/functionslight.png "The Functions view")

The **Functions** view shows processes, modules, and functions that are allocating memory.

- The **Name** column shows processes as the highest-level nodes. Underneath processes are modules, and underneath modules are functions.
- These columns show the same information as they do in the **Allocation** and **Call tree** views:

   - **Total (Allocations)**
   - **Self (Allocations)**
   - **Total Size (Bytes)**
   - **Self Size (Bytes)**
   - **Average Size (Bytes)**

### Collection

![The Collection view](../profiling/media/collectionlight.png "The Collection view")

The **Collection** view shows how many objects were collected or retained during garbage collection. This view also shows pie charts to visualize collected and survived objects by type.

- The **Collected** column shows the number of objects that the garbage collector collected.
- The **Survived** column shows the number of objects that survived after the garbage collector was run.

### Filtering tools

The **Allocations**, **Call Tree**, and **Functions** views all contain the **Show Just My Code** and **Show Native Code** options and a filter box.

- **Show Just My Code** collapses systems, frameworks, and other nonuser code into **[External Code]** frames so that you can focus on just your code. For more information, see [Debug user code with Just My Code](../debugger/just-my-code.md).
- **Show Native Code** shows native code within the analysis target and can include nonuser code.
- With the filter box, you can filter down the **Name** or **Function name** column based on the value you provide. Enter a string value in the box. The table then shows only types that contain that string.
