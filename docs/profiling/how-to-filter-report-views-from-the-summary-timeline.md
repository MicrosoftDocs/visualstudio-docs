# How to: Filter report views from the Summary timeline
You can filter the data that appears in performance reports by specifying a time segment in the timeline graph of the Summary View. When you filter reports, the profiling data file is reanalyzed to include only the time segment that you specified.

### To filter a profiling report from the Summary timeline graph

1. In the Summary View timeline graph, click a point on the timeline, and then drag the mouse to another point on the timeline.

     The region that you specified is shaded.

2. Click **Filter by Selection**.
