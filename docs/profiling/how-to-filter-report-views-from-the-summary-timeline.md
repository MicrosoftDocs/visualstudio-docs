# How to: Filter Report Views from the Summary Timeline
You can filter the data that appears in performance reports by specifying a time segment in the timeline graph of the Summary View. When you filter reports, the profiling data file is reanalyzed to include only the time segment that you specified.  
  
### To filter a profiling report from the Summary timeline graph  
  
1.  In the Summary view timeline graph, click a point on the timeline, and then drag the mouse to another point on the timeline.  
  
     The region that you specified is shaded.  
  
2.  Click **Filter by Selection**.
