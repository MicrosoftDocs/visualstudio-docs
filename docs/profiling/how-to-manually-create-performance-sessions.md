# How to: Manually create performance sessions
You can manually create a performance session. You are not required to open a project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to do this. For more information, see [Configure performance sessions](../profiling/configuring-performance-sessions.md).

### To manually create a performance session

1. On the **Debug** menu, point to **Profiler**, then **Performance Explorer**, and then click **New Performance Session**.

     An empty performance session is added to **Performance Explorer**.

2. Right-click **Targets**, and then click **Add Target Binary**.

3. In the **Add Target Binary** dialog box, select the file name, and then click **Open**.

     A new binary is added.
