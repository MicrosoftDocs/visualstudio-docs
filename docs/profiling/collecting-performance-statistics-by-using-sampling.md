# Collect performance statistics by using sampling

By default, the Visual Studio Profiling Tools sampling method collects profiling information every 10,000,000 processor cycles (approximately every one-hundredth of a second on a 1 GHz computer). The sampling method is useful for finding processor utilization issues and is the suggested method for starting most performance investigations.

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. UWP apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).

You can specify the sampling method by using one of the following procedures:

- On the first page of the Profiling Wizard, click **CPU Sampling (recommended)**.
- On the **Performance Explorer** toolbar, in the **Method** list, click **Sampling**.
- On the **General** page of the properties dialog box for the performance session, click **Sampling**.

## Common tasks

You can specify additional options in the _Performance Session_**Property Pages** dialog box of the performance session. To open this dialog box:

- In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session name, and then click **Properties**.

  The tasks in the following table describe options that you can specify in the _Performance Session_**Property Pages** dialog box when you profile by using the sampling method.
