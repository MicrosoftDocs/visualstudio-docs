# Instruction Pointers (IPs) View
The Instruction Pointers view enables you to see specific instructions that are executed during sampling profiling.  
  
 This view is not available during instrumentation profiling.  
  
 For sampling profile data, the IPs view identifies the instructions in a function that was directly executing when the sample was collected.  
  
 For .NET memory data, the Lines view identifies the instructions that allocate memory.
