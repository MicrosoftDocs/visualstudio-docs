# How to: Install the stand-alone profiler
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides a command line based stand-alone profiler that can be run without installing the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE. This situation occurs when a computer does not or cannot have a development environment installed. For example, you should not install a development environment on a production web server.

> [!NOTE]
> When you are using the stand-alone profiler to collect performance data for an ASP.NET web site, the [VSPerfASPNetCmd](../profiling/vsperfaspnetcmd.md) line tool is recommended over [VSPerfCmd](../profiling/vsperfcmd.md) tool.

### To install the stand-alone profiler

1. Download the [Performance Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=performance+tools#performance-tools-for-visual-studio).

1. Locate the stand-alone profile installer (*vs_standaloneprofiler.exe*) where you downloaded the performance tools and run it.

2. Add the path for *vsinstr.exe* to the system path.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To get the path to the profiling tools, see [Specify the path to command line tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md). On 64-bit computers, both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the tools are available. To use the profiler command-line tools, you must add the tools path to the PATH environment variable of the Command Prompt window or add it to the command itself.

3. At the command prompt, type **VSInstr**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the usage information for vsinstr.exe is displayed, everything is set up correctly. If you see an error that states vsinstr.exe or one of its dependencies is not found, make sure that you have your paths set up correctly as described in step 2.

4. Set up symbol server by setting your **_NT_SYMBOL_PATH** variable to **symsrv\*symsrv.dll\*c:\localcache\*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols**

5. After you set up your symbol server by using the system environment variables, run the command line profiler tools at a new command prompt. This allows the new environment variables to take effect. In the command prompt window, type the following command:

    **start %COMSPEC%**

   > [!NOTE]
   > For detailed instructions about how to set up the symbol server package, see [How to: Reference Windows symbol information](../profiling/how-to-reference-windows-symbol-information.md).

6. Use the [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md) tool to serialize your symbols into the profiling data (.vsp) file. Use the **VSPerfReport /summary:all /packsymbols** switches. If you do not have symbols inserted in your data file, make sure that you have the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable set.
