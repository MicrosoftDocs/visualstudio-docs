# How to: Collect Windows counter data

Windows Counters are system performance counters that can be collected at set intervals during profiling. In the Marks view of the Profiling Tools report, a row is labeled **AutoMark** for each collection interval. The row contains columns that describe the performance counter values at that interval. To restrict the analysis to a period of time between two particular marks, select the marks, right-click, and then select **Filter By** > **Marks** from the shortcut menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. UWP apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).

## To collect Windows counter data

1. In Performance Explorer, right-click the session for which you want to configure Windows counters and select **Properties**.

2. In the **Property Pages**, click **Windows Counters**.

3. Select the **Collect Windows Counters** check box.

4. In the **Collection interval (msecs)** text box, type a time interval.

5. Select a category from the **Counter Category** drop-down list.

6. Select an instance from the **Instance** drop-down list.

7. Select the counters you want to use when you profile your application.

8. Click **Apply.**
