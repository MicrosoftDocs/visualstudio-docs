# Create portable profiling data files from the command line
To make sharing of profiling data easier, you can use the [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md) command-line tool to embed the symbols for a profiling run into the .*vsp* file.

 You can also create a pre-analyzed profiling data (.*vsps*) file that is smaller and is quicker to load in the IDE.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the symbol (.*pdb*) files are available to **VSPerfReport**. For more information, see [How to: Specify symbol file locations from the command line](../profiling/how-to-specify-symbol-file-locations-from-the-command-line.md).
>
> For information about the path to **VSReport**, see [Specify the path to command-line tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).
>
> The profiling data in a .*vsps* file cannot be filtered.

### To embed the symbols for a profiling run into a profiling data (.*vsp*) file

- At a command prompt window, type the following command:

   \<Path><strong>VSPerfReport \<</strong>VSP File> **/PackSymbols**

   By default, the .*vsps* file is named with the base name of the .*vsp* file. You can specify an alternative name by using the **Output** option.

### To create a summary profiling data file

- At a command prompt window, type the following command:

   \<Path><strong>VSPerfReport \<</strong>VSP File> **/SummaryFile** [**/Output:**\<File Name>]

   By default, the .*vsps* file is named with the base name of the .*vsp* file. You can specify an alternative name by using the **Output** option.
