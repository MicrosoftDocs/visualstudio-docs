# Sleep Time
These segments in the timeline are associated with the blocking time that is categorized as Sleep. The sleep category implies that a thread has voluntarily given up its logical core and is doing no work. During this time, a thread has been blocked in an API that the Concurrency Visualizer is counting as Sleep. APIs such as `Sleep()` and `SwitchToThread()` fall into this group.
