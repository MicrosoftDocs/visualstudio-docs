# Collect statistics for ASP.NET web apps

This section describes the procedures and options for collecting performance statistics for an ASP.NET Web application by using the **VSPerfASPNETCmd** and **VSPerfCmd** command-line tool and the sampling profiling method.

> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. UWP apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **VSPerfCmd** tool gives you complete access to Profiling Tools functionality, including pausing and resuming profiling, and collecting additional data from processor and Windows performance counters, you should use the  **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command line tool when you do not need this functionality. The **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command line tool is the preferred method when your are profiling ASP.NET Web sites using the stand-alone profiler. Compared with the [VSPerfCmd](../profiling/vsperfcmd.md) command line tool, no environment variables need to be set, and rebooting the computer is not required. For more information, see [Rapid web site profiling with VSPerfASPNETCmd](../profiling/rapid-web-site-profiling-with-vsperfaspnetcmd.md).
