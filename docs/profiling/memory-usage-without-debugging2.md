# Analyze memory usage in release builds (C#, Visual Basic, C++, F#)

The **Memory Usage** tool monitors your app's memory use. You can use the tool to study the real-time memory effects of scenarios you're actively developing in Visual Studio. You can take detailed snapshots of the app's memory states, and compare snapshots to find the root causes of memory issues. The Memory Usage tool is supported on .NET, ASP.NET, C++, or mixed mode (.NET and native) apps.

The Memory Usage tool can run [on release or debug builds](../profiling/running-profiling-tools-with-or-without-the-debugger.md). In this article, we show how to use the Memory Usage tool in the Visual Studio **Performance Profiler**, which is recommended for release builds. For information on choosing the best memory analysis tool for your needs, see [Choose a memory analysis tool](../profiling/analyze-memory-usage.md).

For the best experience with this documentation, choose your preferred development language or runtime from the list at the top of the article.

## Memory Usage diagnostic sessions

**To start a Memory Usage diagnostic session:**

1. Open a project in Visual Studio.

   The Memory Usage tool supports .NET, ASP.NET, C++, or mixed mode (.NET and native) apps.

1. In the Debug menu, set the solution configuration to **Release** and select the deployment target.

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
   The deployment target typically matches the project name, indicating a local deployment.
   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range="vs-2019"
   The deployment target is typically **Local Windows Debugger** (or **Local Machine**).
   ::: moniker-end

1. On the menu bar, select  **Debug** > **Performance Profiler**.

1. Under **Available Tools**, select **Memory Usage**, and then select **Start**.

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
   [ ![Start a Memory Usage diagnostic session.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-start-performance-profiler.png)](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-start-performance-profiler.png#lightbox)
   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range="vs-2019"
   ![Start a Memory Usage diagnostic session.](../profiling/media/memory-usage-start-diagnostics-session.png "Start a Memory Usage diagnostic session")
   ::: moniker-end

   > ![NOTE]
   > For some project types, such as CMake, you must set the startup target to **Executable**. For more information, see [Which tools are supported for my project?](../profiling/choose-performance-tool.md#which-tools-are-supported-for-my-project).

### Monitor memory use

When you start a diagnostic session, your app starts, and the **Diagnostic Tools** window displays a timeline graph of your app's memory use.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
[ ![Screenshot of the Diagnostic Tools window in the Visual Studio Performance Profiler showing a timeline graph of the app's memory use.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-report-overview-vs-2022.png)](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-report-overview-vs-2022.png#lightbox)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Screenshot of the Diagnostic Tools window in the Visual Studio Performance Profiler showing a timeline graph of the app's memory use.](../profiling/media/memory-usage-report-overview.png "Memory Report Overview")
::: moniker-end

The timeline graph shows memory fluctuations as the app runs. Spikes in the graph usually indicate that some code is collecting or creating data, and then discarding it when the processing is done. Large spikes indicate areas that you can optimize. Main concern is a rise in memory consumption that's not returned. This may indicate inefficient memory use or even a memory leak.

### Take snapshots of app memory states

An app uses a large number of objects, and you might want to concentrate your analysis on one scenario. Or, you may find memory issues to investigate. You can take snapshots during a diagnostic session to capture memory usage at particular moments. It's good to get a baseline snapshot of an app before a memory issue appears. You can take another snapshot after the first occurrence of the problem, and additional snapshots if you can repeat the scenario.

To collect snapshots, select **Take snapshot** when you want to capture the memory data.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Screenshot of taking a snapshot.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-take-snapshot.png)
::: moniker-end

### <a name="BKMK_Close_a_monitoring_session"></a> Close the diagnostic session

To stop a monitoring session without creating a report, just close the diagnostic window. To generate a report when you're done collecting or have taken snapshots, select **Stop Collection**.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Screenshot of stopping the collection.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-stop-collection.png)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Screenshot of stopping the collection.](../profiling/media/memory-usage-stop-collection.png)
::: moniker-end

If you have trouble collecting or displaying data, see [Troubleshoot profiling errors and fix issues](../profiling/troubleshoot-profiler-errors.md).

## Memory Usage reports

After you stop data collection, the **Memory Usage** tool stops the app and displays the **Memory Usage** overview page.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Screenshot of the overview page in the Memory Usage tool in the Visual Studio Performance Profiler, showing a memory usage graph and two snapshot panes.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-report-overview-1-vs-2022.png "Memory Usage overview page")
::: moniker-end

![Screenshot of the overview page in the Memory Usage tool in the Visual Studio Performance Profiler, showing a memory usage graph and two snapshot panes.](../profiling/media/memory-usage-report-overview-1.png "Memory Usage overview page")
::: moniker-end

### <a name="BKMK_Memory_Usage_snapshot_views"></a> Memory Usage snapshots

The numbers in the **Snapshot** panes show the objects and bytes in memory when each snapshot was taken, and the difference between the snapshot and the previous one.

The numbers are links that open detailed **Memory Usage** report views in new Visual Studio windows. A [snapshot details report](#managed-types-reports) shows the types and instances in one snapshot. A [snapshot difference (diff) report](#change-diff-reports) compares the types and instances in two snapshots.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
  ![Screenshot of Snapshot view links](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-snapshot-view-numbered-vs-2022.png "Snapshot view links")

For C++, the **Objects (Diff)** column is named **Allocations (Diff)**.

## Managed types reports

[!INCLUDE [managed-types-report](../profiling/includes/managed-types-report.md)]

### <a name="BKMK_Report_tree_filters_"></a> Report tree filters

Many types in apps aren't required for app developers to investigate memory issues. The snapshot report filters can hide most of these types in the **Managed Memory** and **Paths to Root** trees.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
![Sort and filter options](../profiling/media/vs-2022/memory-usage-sort-and-filter-vs-2022.png "Memory usage sort and filter")
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Sort and filter options](../profiling/media/memory-usage-sort-and-filter.png "Memory Usage Sort and Filter")
::: moniker-end

- <a name="BKMK_Filter"></a> To filter a tree by type name, enter the name in the **Filter** box. The filter isn't case-sensitive, and it recognizes the specified string in any part of the type name.

- <a name="BKMK_Just_My_Code"></a> Select **Show Just My Code** in the **Filter** dropdown to hide most instances that are generated by external code. External types belong to the operating system or framework components, or are generated by the compiler.

- <a name="BKMK_Collapse_Small_Objects"></a> Select **Collapse Small Objects** in the **Filter** dropdown to hide types whose **Size (Bytes)** is less than 0.5 percent of the total memory.
