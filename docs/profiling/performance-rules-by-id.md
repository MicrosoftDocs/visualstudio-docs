# Performance rules by ID

| Warning | Description |
| - | - |
| [DA0001: Use StringBuilder for concatenations](../profiling/da0001-use-stringbuilder-for-concatenations.md) | Calls to System.String.Concat are a significant proportion of the profiling data. Consider using the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> class to construct strings from more than one segment. |
| [DA0002: VSPerfCorProf.dll is missing](../profiling/da0002-vsperfcorprof-dll-is-missing.md) | The profiler couldn't find VSPerfCorProf.dll during the profiling run. This warning occurs when command-line tools for the collection of profiler data are used without using the VSPerfCLREnv.cmd tool to initialize the necessary environment variables. |
| [DA0003: Many kernel samples](../profiling/da0003-many-kernel-samples.md) | A significant proportion of the call stack samples collected for the application were executing in kernel mode. Consider profiling your application by using a different profiling method. |
| [DA0004: High processor usage](../profiling/da0004-high-processor-usage.md) | Processor (CPU) usage was enormous while profiling data that was collected using the instrumentation method. Consider using the sampling profiling method when profiling a CPU bound application. |
| [DA0005: Frequent GC2 collections](../profiling/da0005-frequent-gc2-collections.md) | A high number of .NET memory objects are being reclaimed in generation 2 garbage collection. |
| [DA0006: Override Equals() for value types](../profiling/da0006-override-equals-parens-for-value-types.md) | Calls to the Equals method or the equality operators of a public value type are a significant proportion of the profiling data. Consider implementing a more efficient method. |
| [DA0007: Avoid using exceptions for control flow](../profiling/da0007-avoid-using-exceptions-for-control-flow.md) | A high rate of .NET Framework exception handlers were called in the profiling data. Consider using other control flow logic to reduce the number of exceptions that are thrown. |
| [DA0008: Few samples collected](../profiling/da0008-few-samples-collected.md) | Only a few samples were collected in the profiling run. Consider a longer run or faster sampling rate for more significant results. |
| [DA0009: High % time in JIT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/b60c1767-515c-41d9-81c2-c70d0b7024fd) | A significant percentage of application execution time was spent in the Just In Time (JIT) compiler. |
| [DA0010: Expensive GetHashCode](../profiling/da0010-expensive-gethashcode.md) | Calls to the GetHashCode method of the type are a significant proportion of the profiling data or the method allocates memory. |
| [DA0011: Expensive CompareTo](../profiling/da0011-expensive-compareto.md) | The CompareTo method of the type is expensive or allocates memory. |
| [DA0012: Significant amount of Reflection](../profiling/da0012-significant-amount-of-reflection.md) | Calls to the System.Reflection methods such as InvokeMember and GetMember or to Type methods such as MemberInvoke are a significant proportion of the profiling data. When you can, consider replacing these methods with early binding to the methods of dependent assemblies. |
| [DA0013: High usage of String.Split or String.Substring](../profiling/da0013-high-usage-of-string-split-or-string-substring.md) | Calls to the System.String.Split or System.String.Substring methods are a signifiicant portion of the profiling data. Consider using System.String.IndexOf or System.String.IndexOfAny if you're testing for the existence of a substring in a string. |
| [DA0014: Extremely high rates of paging active memory to disk](../profiling/da0014-extremely-high-rates-of-paging-active-memory-to-disk.md) | System performance data that was collected in the profiling run indicates an enormous rate of paging active memory to and from the disk occurred throughout the profiling run. Paging rates at this level usually will impact application performance and responsiveness. Consider reducing memory allocations by revising algorithms. You might also have to consider the memory requirements of your application, or running profiling again on a computer that has more memory. |
| [DA0017: High rates of paging active memory to disk](../profiling/da0017-high-rates-of-paging-active-memory-to-disk.md) | System performance data that was collected in the profiling run indicates a high rate of paging active memory to and from the disk occurred throughout the profiling run. Paging rates at this level usually will impact application performance and responsiveness. Consider reducing memory allocations by revising algorithms. You might also have to consider the memory requirements of your application, or running profiling again on a computer that has more memory. |
| [DA0018: 32-bit Application running at process managed memory limits](../profiling/da0018-32-bit-application-running-at-process-managed-memory-limits.md) | System data that was collected during the profiling run indicates the .NET Framework memory heaps approached the highest size the managed heaps can grow to in a 32-bit process. The value reported is the highest observed value of the heaps while the profiled process being was active. Consider optimizing the use of managed resources by the application. |
| [DA0021: High rate of Gen 1 garbage collections](../profiling/da0021-high-rate-of-gen-1-garbage-collections.md) | System performance data that was collected during profiling indicate a significant proportion of the memory for.NET Framework objects was reclaimed in generation 1 of garbage collection compared to generation 0 data collection. |
| [DA0022: High rate of Gen 2 garbage collections](../profiling/da0022-high-rate-of-gen-2-garbage-collections.md) | System performance data that was collected during profiling indicate a significant proportion of the memory for.NET Framework objects was reclaimed in generation 2 of garbage collection compared to generation 0 and generation 1 garbage collections. |
| [DA0023: High GC CPU time](../profiling/da0023-high-gc-cpu-time.md) | System performance data that was collected during profiling indicates the amount of time spent in garbage collection is significant compared with the total application processing time. |
| [DA0024: Excessive GC CPU Time](../profiling/da0024-excessive-gc-cpu-time.md) | System performance data that was collected during profiling indicates the amount of time spent in garbage collection is excessively high compared with the total application processing time. |
| [DA0026: Excessive kernel CPU time processing](../profiling/da0026-excessive-kernel-cpu-time-processing.md) | The proportion CPU time that was executed in kernel mode was more than the amount of time spent in user mode.
