# Analyze performance by using CPU profiling in the Performance Profiler (C#, Visual Basic, C++, F#)

A good way to start investigating performance issues in your app is to understand its CPU utilization using a CPU profiler. Visual Studio's **CPU Usage** performance tool shows the CPU active computation time and percentage spent executing code in C++, C#/Visual Basic.

The CPU Usage tool can help you:

- **Diagnose a slow-down or a process hang in your team’s codebase.**
  The tool can help you diagnose the issue with your team’s production code. It provides automatic insights and various views of your data so that you can analyze and diagnose performance issues.

- **Identify performance issues in DevOps scenarios**
  For example, the tool can help when a customer reports that some requests or orders are not getting through to the retail website during peak season. Often, the issues are in production, and it is challenging to debug at that moment, but this tool can help you capture enough information and evidence of the issue. After collecting a trace file, the analysis can quickly help you understand potential causes and give suggestions within the context of your code so that you can take the next steps to fix the issue.

- **Check for high CPU utilization**
  If your latency issue isn’t within an API request, then you can check for high CPU utilization and other related issues with the CPU Usage tool. The CPU Usage tool can help you identify bottlenecks so that you can narrow down where to optimize. 

The **CPU Usage** tool is helpful for both local trace sessions and production. You can run the CPU Usage tool by using the keyboard shortcut, **Alt+F2**, and then choosing **CPU Usage**, or by opening an already collected trace using a tool like [dotnet-trace](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace) or [dotnet-monitor](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-monitor). (For .NET production code, this is most likely how you would collect traces.)

You can run the CPU Usage tool on an open Visual Studio project, on an installed Microsoft Store app, or attached to a running app or process. You can run the CPU Usage tool on release or debug builds. For more information, see [Run profiling tools on release or debug builds](../profiling/running-profiling-tools-with-or-without-the-debugger.md).

The following instructions show how to use the CPU Usage tool without the debugger, using the Visual Studio Performance Profiler. The examples use a Release build on a local machine. Release builds provide the best view of actual app performance. For a tutorial that shows how to improve performance using the CPU Usage tool, see [Case study: Beginner's guide to optimizing code](../profiling/optimize-code-using-profiling-tools.md).

Usually, the local machine best replicates installed app execution. To collect data from a remote device, run the app directly on the device, not over a Remote Desktop Connection.

## Collect CPU utilization data

1. In the Visual Studio project, set the solution configuration to **Release** and select **Local Windows Debugger** (or **Local Machine**) as the deployment target.

    ![Screenshot that shows Select Release and Local Machine.](../profiling/media/cpu-use-select-release-local-machine.png "Select Release and Local Machine")
    ::: moniker-end

1. Select **Debug** > **Performance Profiler**.

1. Under **Available tools**, select **CPU Usage**, and then select **Start**.

    ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
    ![Screenshot that shows Select CPU Usage.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/cpu-use-lib-choose-cpu-usage.png "Select CPU Usage")

    ::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
    ![Screenshot that shows Select CPU Usage.](../profiling/media/cpu-use-lib-choose-cpu-usage.png "Select CPU Usage")
    ::: moniker-end

    If you enable the **Start with collection paused** option before starting the profiler, data will not be collected until you select the **Record** button in the diagnostic session view.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information on how to make the tool more efficient, see [Optimizing Profiler settings](../profiling/optimize-profiler-settings.md).

1. After the app starts, the diagnostic session begins and displays CPU utilization data. When you're finished collecting data, select **Stop Collection**.

    ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
    ![Screenshot that shows Stop CPU Usage data collection.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/cpu-use-wt-stop-collection.png "Stop CPU Usage data collection")

    ![Screenshot that shows Stop CPU Usage data collection.](../profiling/media/cpu-use-wt-stop-collection.png "Stop CPU Usage data collection")
    ::: moniker-end

    The CPU Usage tool analyzes the data and displays the report. If you have trouble collecting or displaying data, see [Troubleshoot profiling errors and fix issues](../profiling/troubleshoot-profiler-errors.md).

## Analyze CPU utilization

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
For in-depth analysis of the CPU Usage report, first open one of the detailed report views:

1. Click **Open details** in the summary page of the report, or select one of the top functions to open the **Functions** view.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Open details link.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/cpu-use-open-details.png)

1. From the **Current View** list, you can select one of the detailed report views.

   ![Screenshot that shows the list of detailed reports.](../profiling/media/vs-2022/cpu-use-select-detailed-view.png)

The following table provides a description of the detailed views.

|View|Description|
|-|-|
|Caller/callee|Detailed view of CPU time for a specific function, the function(s) that called it, and the function(s) that it calls. The performance data is aggregated for the data collection period. You can select calling functions and called functions to traverse the call path.|
|Call tree|Hierarchical view of the function call path. Used to identify call paths that are taking the most CPU time (hot path).|
|Modules|View of the CPU time spent in individual modules, aggregated over the data collection period. Used to identify modules that might be performance bottlenecks due to a combination of high call counts and/or performance issues.|
|Functions|View of the CPU time spent in individual functions, aggregated over the data collection period. Used to identify functions that might be performance bottlenecks due to a combination of high call counts and/or performance issues.|
|Flame graph|Hierarchical view of the function call path in a flame graph visualization. Used to identify call paths that are taking the most CPU time (hot path).|

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
To analyze the report, click **Create detailed report**.

The report provides different views of the diagnostic data:

- Caller/callee
- Call tree
::: moniker-end

In all views except Caller/callee, the diagnostic report is sorted by **Total CPU**, from highest to lowest. Change the sort order or sort column by selecting the column headers. You can double-click on a function that you are interested in, and you will see the source for the function as well as highlighting that shows where time is spent in that function. The table shows columns with data such as the time spent in the function, including called functions (Total CPU), and a second column that shows the time spent in a function, excluding called functions (Self CPU).

This data can help you assess whether the function itself is a performance bottleneck. Determine how much data the method is displaying to see if third-party code or runtime libraries are the reason for your endpoints being slow or resource-consumption heavy.

#### <a name="BKMK_External_Code"></a> External code

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
System and framework functions that are executed by your code are called *external code*. External code functions start and stop the app, draw the UI, control threading, and provide other low-level services to the app. In most cases, you aren't interested in external code, so the CPU Usage call tree gathers the external functions of a user method into one **[External Call]** node.

To view the call paths of external code, on the main report summary page (right pane), deselect **Show Just My Code** from the **Settings** dropdown, and then select **Apply**. (The **Settings** dropdown is available on the main report summary page, not the detailed views.)

When you disable **Show Just My Code**, the **Call Tree** view of the **CPU Usage** page expands the external code calls.

Many external code call chains are deeply nested, so the width of the chain can exceed the display width of the **Function Name** column. The function names then appear as shown in the following image.

### <a name="BKMK_Asynchronous_functions_in_the_CPU_Usage_call_tree"></a> Asynchronous functions in the CPU usage call tree

When the compiler encounters an asynchronous method, it creates a hidden class to control the method's execution. Conceptually, the class is a state machine. The class has compiler-generated functions that asynchronously call the original methods, and the callbacks, scheduler, and iterators needed to run them. When a parent method calls the original method, the compiler removes the method from the execution context of the parent, and runs the hidden class methods in the context of the system and framework code that controls app execution. The asynchronous methods are often, but not always, executed on one or more different threads. This code appears in the **CPU Usage** call tree as children of the **[External Code]** node immediately below the top node of the tree.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
In the following example, the first two nodes under **[External Code]** are the compiler-generated methods of the state machine class. The third node is the call to the original method.

- `MainPage::GetMaxNumberAsyncButton_Click` just manages a list of the task values, computes the maximum of the results, and displays the output.

- `MainPage+<GetMaxNumberAsyncButton_Click>d__3::MoveNext` shows you the activity required to schedule and launch the 48 tasks that wrap the call to `GetNumberAsync`.

- `MainPage::<GetNumberAsync>b__b` shows the activity of the tasks that call `GetNumber`.

### Collect call counts (.NET)

If you want to view call counts in the Functions view, you can enable the setting before you start the profiler. This setting is supported for .NET project types and requires launching the process under the profiler. The attach scenario is not supported.

1. Select the **Settings** icon for CPU Usage in the Performance Profiler.

   ![Screenshot that shows the settings icon for CPU Usage.](media/vs-2022/cpu-usage-settings-icon.png "Settings icon for CPU Usage.")

1. Enable the **Collect call counts (.NET only)** option.

   ![Screenshot that shows settings for CPU Usage.](media/vs-2022/cpu-usage-enable-call-count.png "Settings for CPU Usage.")

1. Collect CPU usage data.

1. Open the Functions view, and then make sure the **Call count** column is set to visible.

   If you don't see the column, right click a column heading to choose visible columns.
