# Collecting Application Statistics for Stand-Alone Applications by Using the Profiler Command Line
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting performance statistics for a client (stand-alone) application by using the sampling method from the command line.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).
