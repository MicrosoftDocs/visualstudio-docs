# DA0002: VSPerfCorProf.dll is missing

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|Rule Id|DA0002|
|Category|Profiling Tools Usage|
|Profiling methods|Profiling using the VSPerfCmd and VSPerfASPNETCmd command line tools|
|Message|It appears that the file was collected without properly setting the environment variables with *VSPerfCLREnv.cmd*. Symbols for managed binaries may not resolve.|
|Rule type|Information|

## Cause
 The profiler could not find *VSPerfCorProf.dll* during the profiling run. This warning occurs when command-line tools for the collection of profiler data are used without using the *VSPerfCLREnv.cmd* tool to initialize the necessary environment variables. The warning can also fire if another profiler is running when the Profiling Tools start.

## Rule description
 Specific environment variables must be set before a profiling run for the profiler to resolve the symbols in .NET Framework binaries. This warning suggests that the *VSPerfCLREnv.cmd* tool was not run before the profiling data was collected. Symbols for managed binaries might not resolve. For more information about using the Profiling Tools from the command line, see [Profiling from the command-line](../profiling/using-the-profiling-tools-from-the-command-line.md)

## How to fix violations
 When you are profiling managed applications by using the command-line tools in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools, run the [VSPerfCLREnv](../profiling/vsperfclrenv.md) command-line tool before you start collecting data.
