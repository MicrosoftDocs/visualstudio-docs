# How to: Select a load test results repository

You are not limited to a local results store. Frequently, load tests are run on a remote set of Agent computers. Agents, together with a controller, can generate more simulated load than any single computer. For more information, see [Test controllers and test agents](configure-test-agents-and-controllers-for-load-tests.md).

Test results from your agents or your local computer can be saved to any SQL server on which you have created a load test results store. In either case, you must identify where you want to store your load test results by using the **Administer Test Controllers** window.

[!INCLUDE [web-load-test-deprecated](includes/web-load-test-deprecated.md)]

## Identify a results store for load test data

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open your load test file.

2. From the **Load Test** toolbar, choose **Manage Test Controllers**. The **Manage Test Controller** dialog box is displayed. If you are using an agent remotely, you must select a controller.

3. In the **Load test results store**, click **(â€¦)** to display the **Connection Properties** dialog box.

4. In **Server Name**, type the name of the server where you have run the `LoadTest` scripts.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are using SQL Express on your local machine for the load test store, enter \<computername>\sqlexpress (for example, **MyComputer\sqlexpress**).

5. Under **Log on to the server**, you can choose **Use Windows Authentication**. You can specify the username and password, but if you do, you have to select the option **Save my password**.

6. Under **Connect to a database**, choose **Select or enter a database name**. Select **LoadTest** from the drop-down list box.

7. Choose **OK**. You can test the connection by choosing **Test Connection**.

8. Choose **Close** in the **Manage Test Controller** dialog box.
