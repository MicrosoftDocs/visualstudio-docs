# Sample Excel Extension: Element Classes
The extension uses classes that are derived from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement> and represent the Worksheet control and Cell control in [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../test/includes/ofprexcel_md.md)].  
  
 The base element for this extension is the `ExcelElement`. The `ExcelWorksheetElement` class and the `ExcelCellElement` class inherit from that element  
  
## Element and ElementInformation Classes  
 The `Element` is the base class for all user interface elements for the Excel extension, and it inherits from the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement> class. `ElementInformation` is the base class for the element information classes in the sample, and it has no members.  
  
#### Simple Properties and Methods  
 These members return simple values, such as the value of the `Name` property or the value of the `ClassName` property, and the code is clear and easy to read. Some values are returned by using the `Utility` class, which is discussed later. Others return `null` because they are not relevant in this sample extension. Two members are more interesting than the others: the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.QueryId%2A> property and the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.CacheProperties%2A> method.  
  
#### QueryId Property  
 This property returns a condition that is made of property name-value pairs that uniquely identify the control during playback. For each derived control class, the developer must override this property to return an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.IQueryElement> object that the framework can use to find the control in the UI.  
  
#### CacheProperties Method  
 This method is called by the testing framework during the recording process to tell the element to save a snapshot of important properties. This keeps the properties available even when the actual UI control is no longer on the screen.  
  
## WorksheetElement and WorksheetInformation Classes  
 The `WorksheetElement` class represents an Excel Worksheet in the testing framework, and inherits from the `Element` base class. Three properties are overridden to provide specific information about the Excel Worksheet object: <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.ClassName%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.ControlTypeName%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.Name%2A>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> is also applied to this class to make it visible to COM.  
  
 The `WorksheetInformation` class represents information about an Excel Worksheet. It has only one member, the `SheetName` property, which is sufficient for this sample.  
  
## CellElement and CellInformation Classes  
 The `CellElement` class represents an Excel Cell, and inherits from the `Element` base class. The only overridden member is the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.UITechnologyElement.QueryId%2A> property, which returns an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.IQueryElement> that uses the `RowIndex` and `ColumnIndex` properties to identify the cell.  
  
## Utilities and ExcelUtilities Classes  
 The internal `ExcelUtilities` class provides some constant values, such as the technology name, and a method that determines if the provided window handle represents an Excel worksheet.  
  
 The `Utilities` class has helper methods that return a variety of information about the UI. Some methods use direct calls into external system DLLs, such as **USER32.DLL** and **OLEACC.DLL**, to get window handles from the UI**.**
