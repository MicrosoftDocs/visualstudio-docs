> Web performance and load test functionality is deprecated. Visual Studio 2019 is the last version where web performance and load testing will be fully available. For more information, see the [Cloud-based load testing service end of life](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/cloud-based-load-testing-service-eol/) blog post. To reduce the impact on users some minimum support is still available in Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3 or later.
