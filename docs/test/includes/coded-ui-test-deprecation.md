> [!NOTE]
> Coded UI Test for automated UI-driven functional testing is deprecated. Visual Studio 2019 is the last version where Coded UI Test will be fully available. We recommend using [Selenium](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for testing web apps and [Appium with WinAppDriver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver) for testing desktop and UWP apps. Consider [Xamarin.UITest](/appcenter/test-cloud/uitest/) for testing iOS and Android apps using the NUnit test framework. To reduce the impact on customers some minimum support will still be available in Visual Studio 2022 Preview 4 or later.
