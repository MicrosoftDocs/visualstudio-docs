# How to: Create a web service test

You can use a web performance test to test web services. By using the **Insert Request** and **Insert Web Service Request** options, you can customize the individual requests in the **Web Performance Test Editor** to locate web service pages. Typically, you do not display these pages in the web application. Therefore, you must customize the request to gain access to these pages.

>[!NOTE]
> Web performance and load test functionality is deprecated in Visual Studio 2019. For Application Insights, multi-step web tests depend on Visual Studio webtest files. It was [announced](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/cloud-based-load-testing-service-eol/) that Visual Studio 2019 will be the last version with webtest functionality. It is important to understand that while no new features will be added, webtest functionality in Visual Studio 2019 is still currently supported and will continue to be supported during the support lifecycle of the product. The Azure Monitor product team has addressed questions regarding the future of multi-step availability tests [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/26050#issuecomment-468814101).

**Requirements**

Visual Studio Enterprise

## To create a simple web service

To test, you can use your own web service or use the basic Web Service (ASMX) template included in Visual Studio. To create a simple web service using this template:

1. In Visual Studio, create a new project using the ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) template, and select the **Empty** template when prompted. Type a name and create the project.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project node, choose **Add** > **New Item**, and then choose **Web Service (ASMX)**. Add the web service.

1. Open *WebService1.asmx* and replace the default `HelloWorld` web method with the following code.

   ```csharp
   public string HelloWorld(string str)
   {
      return "Hello, " + str;
   }
   ```

## Install the load testing component

If you don't already have the web performance and load testing tools component installed, you'll need to install it through the Visual Studio Installer.

1. Open **Visual Studio Installer** from the **Start** menu of Windows. You can also access it in Visual Studio from the new project dialog box or by choosing **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features** from the menu bar.

1. In **Visual Studio Installer**, choose the **Individual components** tab, and scroll down to the **Debugging and testing** section. Select **Web performance and load testing tools**.

1. Choose the **Modify** button.

   The web performance and load testing tools component is installed.

## Create a web test project

A web test requires the Web Performance and Load Test Project project template. In this section, we'll create a C# load test project. You can also create a Visual Basic load test project, if you prefer.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

1. Open Visual Studio.

   If you are using the sample Web Service (ASMX) template, you can add the web test project to the same solution.

2. Choose **File** > **New** > **Project** from the menu bar.

   The **New Project** dialog box opens.

3. In the **New Project** dialog box, expand **Installed** and **Visual C#**, and then select the **Test** category. Choose the **Web Performance and Load Test Project** template.

4. Enter a name for the project if you don't want to use the default name, and then choose **OK**.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

1. Open Visual Studio.

   If you are using the sample Web Service (ASMX) template, you can add the web test project to the same solution.

2. On the start window, choose **Create a new project**.

3. On the **Create a new project** page, type **web test** into the search box, and then select the **Web Performance and Load Test Project \[Deprecated]** template for C#. Choose **Next**.

4. Enter a name for the project if you don't want to use the default name, and then choose **Create**.

::: moniker-end

   Visual Studio creates the project and displays the files in **Solution Explorer**. The project initially contains one web test file named *WebTest1.webtest*.

## To test a web service

1. Start your web service and, if necessary, choose **Stop** to pause the service.

1. In the web test project, open *WebTest1.webtest*, which opens the Web Performance Test Editor. In the test editor, right-click the web performance test and select **Add Web Service Request**.

1. In the **Url** property of the new request, type the name of the web service, such as **https://localhost:44318/WebService1.asmx**.

1. For the web service, open a separate session of the browser and type the URL of the *.asmx* page in the **Address** toolbar. At the top of the web page, select the method that you want to test and examine the SOAP message. (In the example web service, the method is HelloWorld.) When you open the method, you see it contains a `SOAPAction`.

1. In the **Web Performance Test Editor**, right-click the request and select **Add Header** to add a new header. In the **Name** property, type `SOAPAction`. In the **Value** property, type the value that you see in `SOAPAction`, such as *http://tempuri.org/HelloWorld*.

1. Expand the URL node in the test editor, choose the **String Body** node and in the **Content Type** property enter a value of `text/xml`.

1. Return to the browser in step 4, select the XML portion of the SOAP request from the web service description page and copy it to the clipboard.

   The XML content resembles the following example:

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
     <soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
       <soap:Body>
         <HelloWorld xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
           <str>string</str>
         </HelloWorld>
       </soap:Body>
     </soap:Envelope>
     ```

1. Return to the Web Performance Test Editor, and then choose the ellipsis **(â€¦)** in the **String Body** property. Paste the contents of the clipboard into the property.

1. Replace any placeholder values in the XML with valid values so that the test can pass. In the previous example, you would replace the instance of `string` with a name.

1. Right-click the web service request and select **Add URL QueryString Parameter**.

1. Assign the query string parameter a name and value. In the previous example, the name is `op` and the value is `HelloWorld`. This identifies the web service operation to perform.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use data binding in the SOAP body to replace any placeholder value with data bound values by using the `{{DataSourceName.TableName.ColumnName}}` syntax.

1. Run the test. In the top pane of the **Web Performance Test Results Viewer**, select the web service request. In the bottom pane, select the **Web Browser** tab. The XML that is returned by the web service, and the results of any operations, will be displayed.

   Look for the results for your web service request.
