# How to: Add a threshold rule using the load test editor

Threshold rules in load tests compare a performance counter value with either a constant value or another performance counter value.

[!INCLUDE [web-load-test-deprecated](includes/web-load-test-deprecated.md)]

## To add a threshold rule

1. Open a load test.

2. In the Load Test Editor, expand the **Counter Sets** node.

3. Expand one of the **Counter Categories** in one of the Counter Sets. For example, you can select **LoadTest:Scenario**. Expand the node.

4. Right-click one of the counters, for example, **User Load**, under **LoadTest:Scenario**. Select **Add Threshold Rule**.

     The **Add Threshold Rule** dialog box is displayed.

5. You can choose from two types of rules: **Compare Constant** and **Compare Counter**. Select the appropriate type and set the values.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Set the **Alert If Over** property to **True** to indicate that exceeding a threshold is a problem, or to **False** to indicate that falling below a threshold is a problem.
