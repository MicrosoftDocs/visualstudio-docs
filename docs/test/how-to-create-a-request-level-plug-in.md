# How to: Create a request-level plug-in

*Requests* are the declarative statements that constitute web performance tests. Web performance test plug-ins enable you to isolate and reuse code outside the main declarative statements in your web performance test. You can create plug-ins and add them to an individual request as well as to the web performance test that contains it. A customized  *request plug-in* offers you a way to call code as a particular request is run in a web performance test.

[!INCLUDE [web-load-test-deprecated](includes/web-load-test-deprecated.md)]

Every web performance test request plug-in has a PreRequest method and a PostRequest method. After you attach a request plug-in to a particular http request, the PreRequest event will be fired before the request is issued and the PostRequest fired after the response is received.

You can create a customized web performance test request plug-in by deriving your own class from the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting.WebTestRequestPlugin> base class.

You can use customized web performance test request plug-ins with the web performance tests you have recorded. Customized web performance test request plug-ins enable you to write a minimal amount of code to attain a greater level of control over your web performance tests. However, you can also use them with coded web performance tests. See [Generate and run a coded web performance test](../test/generate-and-run-a-coded-web-performance-test.md).

## To create a request-level plug-in

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the solution, select **Add** and then choose **New Project**.

2. Create a new **Class Library** project.

3. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **References** folder in the new class library and select **Add Reference**.

     The **Add Reference** dialog box is displayed.

4. Choose the **.NET** tab, scroll down, select **Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.WebTestFramework** and then choose **OK**

     The reference to **Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.WebTestFramework** is added to the **Reference** folder in **Solution Explorer**.

5. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the top node of the web performance and load test project that contains the load test to which you want to add the web performance test request test plug-in. Select **Add Reference**.

     The **Add Reference dialog box is displayed**.

6. Choose the **Projects** tab, select the **Class Library Project** and then choose **OK** .

7. In the **Code Editor**, write the code of your plug-in. First, create a new public class that derives from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting.WebTestRequestPlugin>.

8. Implement code inside one or both of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting.WebTestRequestPlugin.PreRequest*> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting.WebTestRequestPlugin.PostRequest*> event handlers. See the following Example section for a sample implementation.

9. After you have written the code, build the new project.

10. Open the web performance test to which you want to add the request plug-in.

11. Right-click the request to which you want to add the request plug-in, and select **Add Request Plug-in**.

     The **Add Web Test Request Plug-in** dialog box is displayed.

12. Under **Select a plug-in**, select your new plug-in.

13. In the **Properties for selected plug-in** pane, set the initial values for the plug-in to use at run time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can expose as many properties as you want from your plug-ins; just make them public, settable, and of a base type such as Integer, Boolean, or String. You can also change the web performance test plug-in properties later by using the Properties window.

14. Choose **OK**.

     The plug-in is added to the **Request Plug-ins** folder, which is a child folder of the HTTP request.

    > [!WARNING]
    > You might get an error similar to the following when you run a web performance test or load test that uses your plug-in:
    >
    > **Request failed: Exception in \<plug-in> event: Could not load file or assembly '\<"Plug-in name".dll file>, Version=\<n.n.n.n>, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.**
    >
    > This is caused if you make code changes to any of your plug-ins and create a new DLL version **(Version=0.0.0.0)**, but the plug-in is still referencing the original plug-in version. To correct this problem, follow these steps:
    >
    > 1. In your web performance and load test project, you will see a warning in references. Remove and re-add the reference to your plug-in DLL.
    > 2. Remove the plug-in from your test or the appropriate location and then add it back.

## Example

You can use the following code to create a customized web performance test plug-in that displays two dialog boxes. One dialog box displays the URL that is associated with the request to which you attach the request add-in. The second dialog box displays the computer name for the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> The following code requires that you add a reference to System.Windows.Forms.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting;

namespace RequestPluginNamespace
{
    public class MyWebRequestPlugin : WebTestRequestPlugin
    {
        public override void PostRequest(object sender, PostRequestEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(e.WebTest.Context.AgentName);
        }
        public override void PreRequest(object sender, PreRequestEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(e.Request.Url);
        }
    }
}
```
