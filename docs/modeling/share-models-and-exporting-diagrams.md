# Share models and exporting diagrams
In Visual Studio, you can share models and diagrams with colleagues in several ways.  
  
 To see which versions of Visual Studio support this feature, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
## Working on a Model as a Team  
 Users of Visual Studio can create and edit models, layer diagrams, and directed graphs.  
  
 Different users can work at the same time on a UML model, but should work on different packages.  
  
 We recommend that you use [!INCLUDE[esprscc](../code-quality/includes/esprscc_md.md)].  
  
 For more information, see [Manage models and diagrams under version control](../modeling/manage-models-and-diagrams-under-version-control.md).  
  
 For suggestions about organizing models in a medium or large project, see [Structure your modeling solution](../modeling/structure-your-modeling-solution.md).  
  
## Reading and Reviewing Models  
 Team members using some versions of Visual Studio (which cannot create models) can read models, modeling diagrams, and directed graphs, but cannot edit them.  To see which versions of Visual Studio support this feature, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
 A UML diagram or layer diagram can be opened only within the model in which it was created. To provide access to a diagram, you must therefore provide access to all the modeling project files, or to copies of them.  
  
 For more information, see [Read models and diagrams in other Visual Studio editions](../modeling/read-models-and-diagrams-in-other-visual-studio-editions.md).  
  
## Using Diagrams in Documents and Presentations  
 You can copy parts of diagrams into documents or presentations. You can also print diagrams, for example to XPS files.  
  
 For more information, see [Export diagrams as images](../modeling/export-diagrams-as-images.md).
