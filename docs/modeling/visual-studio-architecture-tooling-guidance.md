# Visual Studio Architecture Tooling Guidance

This Architecture Tooling Guidance is a downloadable package of practical guidance about the use of the modeling tools in Visual Studio 2010. It presents a high-level view of how to use all the modeling tools in an integrated manner, and discusses the most common scenarios in which the tools are used.

The content was created by the Visual Studio ALM Rangers, a special group that has members from the Visual Studio Product Team, Microsoft Services, Microsoft Most Valued Professionals (MVPs), and Visual Studio Community Leads.
