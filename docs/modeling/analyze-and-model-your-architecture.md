# Analyze and model your architecture

Make sure your app meets architectural requirements by using Visual Studio architecture and modeling tools to design and model your app.

* Understand existing program code more easily by using Visual Studio to visualize the code's structure, behavior, and relationships.

* Educate your team in the need for respecting architectural dependencies.

* Create models at different levels of detail throughout the application lifecycle as part of your development process.

See [Scenario: Change your design using visualization and modeling](../modeling/scenario-change-your-design-using-visualization-and-modeling.md).

## Types of models and typical uses

### Code maps

Code maps help you see the organization and relationships in your code.

**Typical uses:**

- Examine program code so you can better understand its structure and its dependencies, how to update it, and estimate the cost of proposed changes.

**See:**

- [Map dependencies across your solutions](../modeling/map-dependencies-across-your-solutions.md)
- [Use code maps to debug your applications](../modeling/use-code-maps-to-debug-your-applications.md)
- [Find potential problems using code map analyzers](../modeling/find-potential-problems-using-code-map-analyzers.md)

### Dependency diagrams

Dependency diagrams let you define the structure of an application as a set of layers or blocks with explicit dependencies. Live validation shows conflicts between dependencies in the code and dependencies described on a dependency diagram.

**Typical uses:**

- Stabilize the structure of the application through numerous changes over its life.
- Discover unintentional dependency conflicts before checking in changes to the code.

**See:**

- [Create dependency diagrams from your code](../modeling/create-layer-diagrams-from-your-code.md)
- [Dependency Diagrams: Reference](../modeling/layer-diagrams-reference.md)
- [Validate code with dependency diagrams](../modeling/validate-code-with-layer-diagrams.md)

### Domain-specific language (DSL)

A DSL is a notation that you design for a specific purpose. In Visual Studio, it's usually graphical.

**Typical uses:**

- Generate or configure parts of the application. Work is required to develop the notation and tools. The result can be a better fit to your domain than a UML customization.
- For large projects or in product lines where the investment in developing the DSL and its tools is returned by its use in more than one project.

**See:**

- [Modeling SDK for Visual Studio - Domain-Specific Languages](../modeling/modeling-sdk-for-visual-studio-domain-specific-languages.md)
