# Creating a WPF-Based Domain-Specific Language
You can create a domain-specific language that has a WPF designer instead of a graphical designer.  
  
 Information and samples about this feature can be found on the Visual Studio Visualization and Modeling Tools website at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186128](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186128)
