# Visualize code

You can use the visualization and modeling tools in Visual Studio to help you understand existing code and describe your application. This lets you visually learn how your changes might affect the code and help you assess the work and risks that result from those changes. For example:

- To understand the relationships in your code, map those relationships visually.

- To describe your system's architecture and keep the code consistent with its design, create dependency diagrams and validate code against these diagrams.

- To describe class structures, create class diagrams.

These tools also help you communicate more easily with the people involved with your project.

To see which editions of Visual Studio support each feature, see [Edition support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport)

|**Describe the high-level system design and validate code against this design:**<br /><br /> Describe the high-level system design and its intended dependencies by creating dependency diagrams.
