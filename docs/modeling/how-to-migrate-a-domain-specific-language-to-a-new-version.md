# How to: Migrate a Domain-Specific Language to a New Version
You can migrate projects that define and use domain-specific language to [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)] from the version of [!INCLUDE[dsl](../modeling/includes/dsl_md.md)] that was distributed with [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../debugger/includes/vs_orcas_long_md.md)].

 A migration tool is provided as part of [!INCLUDE[vssdk_current_long](../misc/includes/vssdk_current_long_md.md)]. The tool converts Visual Studio projects and solutions that use or define DSL Tools.

 You must run the migration tool explicitly: it is not launched automatically when you open a solution in Visual Studio. The tool and detailed guidance document can be found at this path:

 **%Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\DSLTools\DslProjectsMigrationTool.exe**

## Before you Migrate your DSL Projects
 The migration tool modifies Visual Studio project files (**.csproj**) and solution files (**.sln**).

#### To prepare projects for migration.

- Make sure the **.csproj** and **.sln** files can be written. If they are under source control, make sure that they are checked out.

- Make a copy of the folders you intend to migrate.

## Migrating a Collection of Projects

#### To Migrate DSL Projects and Solutions to Visual Studio 2010

1. Start the DSL Migration Tool.

   - You can double-click the tool in Windows Explorer (or File Explorer), or start the tool from a command prompt. The tool is in this location:

        **%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\DSLTools\DslProjectsMigrationTool.exe**

2. Choose a folder that contains solutions and projects that you want to convert.

   - Enter the path in the box at the top of the tool, or click **Browse**.

     The migration tool displays a tree of projects that define or use DSLs. The tree includes every project that uses the **Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.Sdk** or **TextTemplating** assemblies.

3. Review the tree of projects, and uncheck projects that you do not want to convert.

   - Select a project or solution to see a list of changes that the tool will make.

       > [!NOTE]
       > The checkboxes that appear next to folder names have no effect. You must expand the folders to inspect the projects and solutions.

4. Convert the projects.

   1. Click **Convert**.

        Before each project file is converted, a copy of _project_**.csproj** is saved as _project_**.vs2008.csproj**

        A copy of each _solution_**.sln** is saved as _solution_**.vs2008.sln**

   2. Investigate any failed conversions that are reported.

        Failures are reported in the text window. In addition, the tree view shows a red flag on each node that has failed to convert. You can click the node to get more information about that failure.

5. **Transform All Templates** in solutions containing successfully converted projects.

   1. Open the solution.

   2. Click the **Transform All Templates** button in the header of Solution Explorer.

       > [!NOTE]
       > You can make this step unnecessary. For more information, see [How to Automate Transform All Templates](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012/ff521399\(v\=vs.110\)).

6. Update your custom code in the converted projects.

   - Attempt to build the projects, and investigate any failures.

   - Test your designer.
