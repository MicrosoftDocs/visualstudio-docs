# What&#39;s New in the XML Editor
The following features are new in Visual Studio 2010.  
  
## XSLT IntelliSense  
 The XSLT IntelliSense feature allows you to auto-complete attribute set names; template modes and names; and parameter names for a specified mode or a specified named template. For more information, see [XML Editor IntelliSense Features](../xml-tools/xml-editor-intellisense-features.md).  
  
## XSLT Profiler  
 The XSLT Profiler creates detailed XSLT performance reports that help you measure, evaluate, and target performance-related problems in XSLT code. The XSLT Profiler also includes useful hints for XSL and XSLT style sheet optimizations. For more information, see [Walkthrough: XSLT Profiler](../xml-tools/walkthrough-xslt-profiler.md).  
  
## XSLT Hierarchy  
 The XSLT Hierarchy tool allows you to add breakpoints in included style sheets and/or built-in template rules. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Using XSLT Hierarchy](../xml-tools/walkthrough-using-xslt-hierarchy.md).
