# XSLT Profiler

The XSLT Profiler is a performance analysis profiler tool that helps you develop and debug XSLT documents. You can measure and evaluate performance-related problems in XSLT code by creating detailed XSLT performance reports. The XSLT Profiler includes useful hints for XSL and XSLT style sheet optimizations, which are essential for XSLT-based applications that demand maximum performance.

The XSLT Profiler is part of Visual Studio and is available from the **XML** menu.
