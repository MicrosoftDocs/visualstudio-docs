# How to: Add nodes to the workspace from the XML Schema Explorer

This topic explains how to add nodes to the [XML Schema Designer workspace](../xml-tools/xml-schema-designer-workspace.md) from the **XML Schema Explorer**. This can be achieved by dragging and dropping nodes from the **XML Schema Explorer** onto an XSD Designer view, or by using the **XML Schema Explorer's** context menu. You can also add nodes that are highlighted as a result of a search performed by the **XML Schema Explorer**. For more information, see [How to: Add schema set search result nodes to the workspace](../xml-tools/how-to-add-schema-set-search-result-nodes-to-the-workspace.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Only global nodes can be added to the [XML Schema Designer workspace](../xml-tools/xml-schema-designer-workspace.md).

## To add nodes through the XML Explorer context menu

1. Follow the steps in [How to: Create and edit an XSD schema file](../xml-tools/how-to-create-and-edit-an-xsd-schema-file.md).

2. Right click on the `PurchaseOrderType` node in the XSD Explorer. Select **Show in Graph View**.

     The `purchaseOrderType` node appears on the design surface of the Graph View.

## To drag and drop a node on to a view

1. Right-click on the `PurchaseOrderType` node in the Graph View. Select **Show in XML Schema Explorer**.

     The node is highlighted in the **XML Schema Explorer**.

2. Right click on the `PurchaseOrderType` node in the **XML Schema Explorer** and select **Show All References**.

     The `purchaseOrder` node is highlighted.

3. Drag the `purchaseOrder` node on to the Graph View.

     The `purchaseOrder` node and the `PurchaseOrderType` node appear next to each other on the design surface of the Graph View. Because the two nodes are related (the `purchaseOrder` element is of the `PurchaseOrderType` type), an arrow is drawn between them.

## To add nodes using the Schema Explorer search capability

1. Type "purchaseOrder" in the search text box of the [XML Explorer](../xml-tools/xml-schema-explorer.md) toolbar and click on the search button.

     The search results are highlighted in the **XML Schema Explorer** and marked by ticks on the vertical scroll bar.

2. Add the search results to the workspace by clicking the **Add highlighted nodes to Workspace** button on the summary results pane.

     The `purchaseOrder` node and the `PurchaseOrderType` node appear next to each other on the design surface of the [Graph View](../xml-tools/graph-view.md). Because the two nodes are related (the `purchaseOrder` element is of the `PurchaseOrderType` type), an arrow is drawn between them.
