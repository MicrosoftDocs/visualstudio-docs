# How to: Create an XML document based on an XSD schema

The **Generate Sample XML** feature generates a sample XML file based on your XML Schema (XSD) file.

You can use this option for the following scenarios:

- To understand the use of various constructs in your schema.

- To confirm that the schema does what it is intended to do.

The **Generate Sample XML** feature is only available on global elements, and requires a valid XML schema set.

This feature typically generates valid XML documents. However, if the schema contains one or more of the following, the sample might not be valid:

- The `xs:key`, `xs:keyref`, and `xs:unique` identity constraints.

- `xs:pattern` facets.

- Enumerations of the `xs:QName` type.

- `xs:ENTITY`, `xs:ENTITIES`, and `xs:NOTATION` types.

Also, note that `xs:base64Binary` content will be generated only if enumerations occur in the schema for that type.

## To generate an XML instance document based on the XSD file

1. Follow the steps in [How to: Create and edit an XSD schema file](../xml-tools/how-to-create-and-edit-an-xsd-schema-file.md).

2. In the [XML Schema Explorer](../xml-tools/xml-schema-explorer.md), right-click the `PurchaseOrder` global element. Select **Generate Sample XML**.

     When you select this option, the PurchaseOrder.*xml* file with the following sample XML content will be generated and opened in the XML editor:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <PurchaseOrder OrderDate="1900-01-01" xmlns="http://tempuri.org/PurchaseOrderSchema.xsd">
      <ShipTo country="US">
        <name>name1</name>
        <street>street1</street>
        <city>city1</city>
        <state>state1</state>
        <zip>1</zip>
      </ShipTo>
      <ShipTo country="US">
        <name>name2</name>
        <street>street2</street>
        <city>city2</city>
        <state>state2</state>
        <zip>-79228162514264337593543950335</zip>
      </ShipTo>
      <BillTo country="US">
        <name>name1</name>
        <street>street1</street>
        <city>city1</city>
        <state>state1</state>
        <zip>1</zip>
      </BillTo>
    </PurchaseOrder>
    ```
