# Debugging XSLT

You can use the Visual Studio debugger to debug XSLT. The debugger supports setting breakpoints, viewing XSLT execution states, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> The XSLT debugger is only available in the Enterprise edition of Visual Studio 2017.

## XSLT profiler

The [XSLT profiler](../xml-tools/xslt-profiler.md) is a tool that allows developers to measure, evaluate, and target performance-related problems in XSLT code by creating detailed XSLT performance reports.
