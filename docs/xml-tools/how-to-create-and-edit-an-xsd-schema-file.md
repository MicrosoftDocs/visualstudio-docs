# How to: Create and Edit an XSD Schema File
This topic describes how to create a new XML Schema (XSD) file and then add content to the XSD file.  
  
### To create a new XML Schema file  
  
1.  In Visual Studio, open the **File** menu and select **New** and then **File**. Or, use the CTRL+N keyboard shortcut.  
  
2.  In the **New File** dialog box, select **XML Schema** and click **Open**.  
  
     A new file is created. The Start View and an empty XML Schema Explorer window appear in Visual Studio.  
  
### To edit a file  
  
1.  Click the **Use XML Editor to view and edit the underlying XML Schema file** link on the Start View.  
  
     The XML Editor appears with the new file open.  
  
2.  Copy the XML Schema sample code from [Purchase Order Schema](../xml-tools/sample-xsd-file-simple-schema.md) and paste it to replace the code that was added to the new XSD file by default.  
  
     The XML Schema Explorer is updated with the new schema set.
