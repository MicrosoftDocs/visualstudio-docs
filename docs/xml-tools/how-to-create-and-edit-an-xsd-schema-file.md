# How to: Create and edit an XSD schema file

This topic describes how to create a new XML Schema (XSD) file and then add content to the XSD file.

## To create a new XML Schema file

1. In Visual Studio, open the **File** menu and select **New** > **File**. Or, use the **Ctrl**+**N** keyboard shortcut.

2. In the **New File** dialog box, select **XML Schema** and then select **Open**.

   A new file is created. The Start View and an empty **XML Schema Explorer** window appear in Visual Studio.

## To edit a file

1. Select the **Use XML editor to view and edit the underlying XML Schema file** link on the Start View.

   The XML editor appears with the new file open.

2. Copy the XML Schema sample code from [Purchase order schema](../xml-tools/sample-xsd-file-simple-schema.md) and paste it to replace the code that was added to the new XSD file by default.

   The **XML Schema Explorer** is updated with the new schema set.
