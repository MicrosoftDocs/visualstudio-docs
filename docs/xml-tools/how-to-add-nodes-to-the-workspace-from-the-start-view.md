# How to: Add nodes to the workspace from the Start View

This topic describes how to add global nodes to the [XML Schema Designer workspace](../xml-tools/xml-schema-designer-workspace.md) from the [Start View](../xml-tools/start-view.md).

## To add nodes to the workspace from the Start View

1. Follow the steps in [How to: Create and edit an XSD schema file](../xml-tools/how-to-create-and-edit-an-xsd-schema-file.md).

2. Right-click in the XML editor and select **View Designer**.

     The Start View appears.

     In the **Schema Set Details** section, notice that there are two (**2**) **Global Complex Types**.

3. Click on the **add** link to the right of the **Global Complex Types** heading.

     The `USAddress` and `PurchaseOrderType` complex type nodes will appear on the design surface of the Graph View.
