# C28272
warning C28272: The annotation for function, parameter when examining is inconsistent with the function declaration  
  
 This warning indicates an error in the annotations, not in the code that is being analyzed. The annotations appearing on a function definition are inconsistent with those appearing on a declaration. The two annotations should be resolved to match.
