# C28199
warning C28199: Using possibly uninitialized memory  
  
 This message indicates that the variable has had its address taken but no assignment to it has been discovered.  
  
 The specified variable is being used without being explicitly initialized, but at some point its address was taken, indicating that it might be initialized invisibly to the Code Analysis tool.  
  
 This warning can be mistaken if the variable is initialized outside of the function.  
  
 The Code Analysis tool reports this warning on function exit if a parameter has an `_Out_` or `_Inout_` annotation and the variable is not initialized.
