# C26105
warning C26105: Lock order violation. Acquiring lock \<lock> with level \<level> causes order inversion.  
  
 Concurrency SAL supports *lock levels*. To declare a lock level, which is denoted by a string literal without double quotes, use `_Create_lock_level_`. You can impose an order of acquisition between two lock levels by using the annotation `_Set_lock_level_order_(A,B)`, which states that locks that have level `A` must be acquired before locks that have level `B`. To establish a lock order hierarchy (a partial order among lock levels), use multiple `_Set_lock_level_order_` annotations. To associate a lock with a lock level, use the `_Set_lock_level_` annotation when you declare the lock. Warning C26105 is issued when a lock ordering violation is detected.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26105 because there is a lock order inversion in the function `OrderInversion`.  
  
```  
  
_Create_lock_level_(MutexLockLevel);  
_Create_lock_level_(TunnelLockLevel);  
_Create_lock_level_(ChannelLockLevel);  
_Lock_level_order_(MutexLockLevel, TunnelLockLevel);  
_Lock_level_order_(TunnelLockLevel, ChannelLockLevel);  
_Has_lock_level_(MutexLockLevel) HANDLE gMutex;  
  
struct Tunnel   
{  
    _Has_lock_level_(TunnelLockLevel) CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
};  
  
struct Channel   
{  
    _Has_lock_level_(ChannelLockLevel) CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
};  
  
void OrderInversion(Channel* pChannel, Tunnel* pTunnel)   
{  
    EnterCriticalSection(&pChannel->cs);   
    // Warning C26105  
    WaitForSingleObject(gMutex, INFINITE);   
    EnterCriticalSection(&pTunnel->cs);  
    LeaveCriticalSection(&pTunnel->cs);  
    LeaveCriticalSection(&pChannel->cs);  
}  
  
```
