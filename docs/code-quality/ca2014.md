# CA2014: Do not use stackalloc in loops

## Cause

Using the C# stackalloc keyword inside of a loop.

## Rule description

The C# stackalloc keyword allocates memory from the current stack frame, and that memory may not be released until the current method call returns.  If the stackalloc keyword is used in a loop, it can lead to stack overflows due to exhausting the stack memory.

## How to fix violations

Move the stackalloc to outside of all loops in the method.

## When to suppress warnings

It may be safe to suppress the warning when the containing loop or loops are invoked only a finite number of times, such that the overall amount of memory allocated across all stackalloc operations is known to be relatively small.
