# CA2232: Mark Windows Forms entry points with STAThread

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA2232|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
An assembly references the <xref:System.Windows.Forms> namespace, and its entry point is not marked with the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute.

## Rule description
 <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> indicates that the COM threading model for the application is single-threaded apartment. This attribute must be present on the entry point of any application that uses Windows Forms; if it is omitted, the Windows components might not work correctly. If the attribute is not present, the application uses the multithreaded apartment model, which is not supported for Windows Forms.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects that use the Application Framework do not have to mark the **Main** method with STAThread. The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler does it automatically.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, add the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> attribute to the entry point. If the <xref:System.MTAThreadAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute is present, remove it.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if you are developing for the .NET Compact Framework, for which the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> attribute is unnecessary and not supported.

## Example
The following examples demonstrate the correct usage of <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute>:
