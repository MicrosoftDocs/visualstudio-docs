# C6216
warning C6216: compiler-inserted cast between semantically different integral types: a Boolean type to HRESULT

 This warning indicates that a Boolean is being used as an `HRESULT` without being explicitly cast. Boolean types indicate success by a non-zero value; success (`S_OK`) in `HRESULT` is indicated by a value of 0. The typical failure value for functions that return a Boolean false is a success status when it is tested as an `HRESULT`. This is likely to lead to incorrect results.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
BOOL IsEqual(REFGUID, REFGUID);

HRESULT f( REFGUID riid1, REFGUID riid2 )
{
  // code ...
  return IsEqual(riid1, riid2);
}
```

 To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
BOOL IsEqual(REFGUID, REFGUID);

HRESULT f( REFGUID riid1, REFGUID riid2 )
{
  if (IsEqual(riid1, riid2) == TRUE)
  {
    // code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
    return E_FAIL;
  }
}
```

 For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.
