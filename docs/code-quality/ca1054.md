# CA1054: URI parameters should not be strings

## Cause

A type declares a method with a string parameter whose name contains "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url" and the type does not declare a corresponding overload that takes a <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=fullName> parameter.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

This rule splits the parameter name into tokens based on the camel casing convention and checks whether each token equals "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url". If there is a match, the rule assumes that the parameter represents a uniform resource identifier (URI). A string representation of a URI is prone to parsing and encoding errors, and can lead to security vulnerabilities. If a method takes a string representation of a URI, a corresponding overload should be provided that takes an instance of the <xref:System.Uri> class, which provides these services in a safe and secure manner.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the parameter to a <xref:System.Uri> type; this is a breaking change. Alternately, provide an overload of the method that takes a <xref:System.Uri> parameter; this is a non-breaking change.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the parameter does not represent a URI.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1054.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type, `ErrorProne`, that violates this rule, and a type, `SaferWay`, that satisfies the rule.
