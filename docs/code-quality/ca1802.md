# CA1802: Use Literals Where Appropriate

## Cause

A field is declared `static` and `readonly` (`Shared` and `ReadOnly` in Visual Basic), and is initialized with a value that is computable at compile time.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible, static, readonly fields, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

The value of a `static readonly` field is computed at run time when the static constructor for the declaring type is called. If the `static readonly` field is initialized when it is declared and a static constructor is not declared explicitly, the compiler emits a static constructor to initialize the field.

The value of a `const` field is computed at compile time and stored in the metadata, which increases run-time performance when it is compared to a `static readonly` field.

Because the value assigned to the targeted field is computable at compile time, change the declaration to a `const` field so that the value is computed at compile time instead of at run time.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the `static` and `readonly` modifiers with the `const` modifier.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of the ([const](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/const) modifier is not recommended for all scenarios.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule, or disable the rule, if performance is not of concern.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), this rule is configurable.

### Api Surface

You can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1802.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Performance). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

### Required modifiers

You can configure this rule to override the required field modifiers. By default, `static` and `readonly` are both required modifiers for fields that are analyzed. You can override this to a comma separated listed of one or more modifier values from the below table:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | No modifier requirement. |
| `static` or `Shared` | Must be declared as 'static' ('Shared' in Visual Basic). |
| `const` | Must be declared as 'const'. |
| `readonly` | Must be declared as 'readonly'. |

For example, to specify that the rule should run against both static and instance fields, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1802.required_modifiers = none
```

## Example

The following example shows a type, `UseReadOnly`, that violates the rule and a type, `UseConstant`, that satisfies the rule.
