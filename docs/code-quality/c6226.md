# C6226
warning C6226: Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: assigning -1 to HRESULT. Consider using E_FAIL instead.  
  
 This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being assigned or initialized with a value of an explicit -1. This warning is frequently caused by accidental confusion of integer and `HRESULT` types. To indicate success, the symbolic constant `S_OK` should be used. To indicate failure, the symbolic constants starting with E_constant should be used.  
  
 For more information see the [SUCCEEDED](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=92738) and [FAILED](ms-help://MS.VSCC.2003/MS.MSDNQTR.2003FEB.1033/com/htm/error_899v.htm) macros.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
VOID f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  
  if (FAILED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))  
  {  
    hr = -1;  
    // code ...  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // code ...  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
VOID f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  
  if (FAILED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))  
  {  
    hr = E_FAIL;  
    // code ...  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // code ...  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.  
  
 Note that the use of malloc and free (and related dynamic memory allocation APIs) have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](/cpp/standard-library/shared-ptr-class), [unique_ptr](/cpp/standard-library/unique-ptr-class), and [vector](/cpp/standard-library/vector). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](/cpp/cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp) and [C++ Standard Library](/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference).
