# CA1058: Types should not extend certain base types

## Cause

A type extends one of the following base types:

- <xref:System.ApplicationException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.CollectionBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Queue?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.SortedList?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Stack?displayProperty=fullName>

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

Exceptions should derive from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> or one of its subclasses in the <xref:System> namespace.

Do not create a subclass of <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> if you want to create an XML view of an underlying object model or data source.

### Non-generic collections

Use and/or extend generic collections whenever possible. Do not extend non-generic collections in your code, unless you shipped it previously.

**Examples of Incorrect Usage**

```csharp
public class MyCollection : CollectionBase
{
}

public class MyReadOnlyCollection : ReadOnlyCollectionBase
{
}
```

**Examples of Correct Usage**

```csharp
public class MyCollection : Collection<T>
{
}

public class MyReadOnlyCollection : ReadOnlyCollection<T>
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, derive the type from a different base type or a generic collection.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule for violations about <xref:System.ApplicationException>. It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule for violations about <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>. It is safe to suppress a warning about a non-generic collection if the code was released previously.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1058.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).
