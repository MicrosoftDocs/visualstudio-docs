# CA1047: Do not declare protected members in sealed types

|Item|Value|

|CheckId|CA1047|
|Category|Microsoft.Design|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
A public type is `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual basic) and declares a protected member or a protected nested type. This rule does not report violations for <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> methods, which must follow this pattern.

## Rule description
Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.

The C# compiler issues a warning for this error.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, change the access level of the member to private, or make the type inheritable.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.

## Configurability
Starting with version 3.0.0 of the analyzer package, If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1047.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example
The following example shows a type that violates this rule.

[!code-vb[FxCop.Design.SealedNoProtected#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1047-do-not-declare-protected-members-in-sealed-types_1.vb)]
[!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.SealedNoProtected#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1047-do-not-declare-protected-members-in-sealed-types_1.cs)]
