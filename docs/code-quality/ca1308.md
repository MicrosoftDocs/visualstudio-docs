# CA1308: Normalize strings to uppercase

## Cause
An operation normalizes a string to lowercase.

## Rule description
Strings should be normalized to uppercase. A small group of characters, when they are converted to lowercase, cannot make a round trip. To make a round trip means to convert the characters from one locale to another locale that represents character data differently, and then to accurately retrieve the original characters from the converted characters.

## How to fix violations
Change operations that convert strings to lowercase so that the strings are converted to uppercase instead. For example, change `String.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` to `String.ToUpper(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning message when you are not making security decision based on the result (for example, when you are displaying it in the UI).
