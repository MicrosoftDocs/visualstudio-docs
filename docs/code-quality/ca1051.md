# CA1051: Do not declare visible instance fields

## Cause

A type has a non-private instance field.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

The primary use of a field should be as an implementation detail. Fields should be `private` or `internal` and should be exposed by using properties. It's as easy to access a property as it is to access a field, and the code in the accessors of a property can change as the features of the type expand without introducing breaking changes.

Properties that just return the value of a private or internal field are optimized to perform on par with accessing a field; the performance gain from using externally visible fields instead of properties is minimal. *Externally visible* refers to `public`, `protected`, and `protected internal` (`Public`, `Protected`, and `Protected Friend` in Visual Basic) accessibility levels.

Additionally, public fields cannot be protected by [Link demands](/dotnet/framework/misc/link-demands). For more information, see [CA2112: Secured types should not expose fields](../code-quality/ca2112.md). (Link demands are not applicable to .NET Core apps.)

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, make the field `private` or `internal` and expose it by using an externally visible property.

## When to suppress warnings

Only suppress this warning if you're certain that consumers need direct access to the field. For most applications, exposed fields do not provide performance or maintainability benefits over properties.

Consumers may need field access in the following situations:

- in ASP.NET Web Forms content controls
- when the target platform makes use of `ref` to modify fields, such as model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) frameworks for WPF and UWP

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1051.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type (`BadPublicInstanceFields`) that violates this rule. `GoodPublicInstanceFields` shows the corrected code.
