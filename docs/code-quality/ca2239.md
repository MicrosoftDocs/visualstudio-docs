# CA2239: Provide deserialization methods for optional fields

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2239|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
A type has a field that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.OptionalFieldAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute and the type does not provide de-serialization event handling methods.

## Rule description
The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.OptionalFieldAttribute> attribute has no effect on serialization; a field marked with the attribute is serialized. However, the field is ignored on de-serialization and retains the default value associated with its type. De-serialization event handlers should be declared to set the field during the de-serialization process.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, add de-serialization event handling methods to the type.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the field should be ignored during the de-serialization process.

## Example
The following example shows a type with an optional field and de-serialization event handling methods.
