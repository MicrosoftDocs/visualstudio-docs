# CA1601: Do not use timers that prevent power state changes

## Cause
A timer has an interval set to occur more than one time per second.

## Rule description
Do not poll more often than one time per second or use timers that occur more frequently than one time per second. Higher-frequency periodic activity will keep the CPU busy and interfere with power-saving idle timers that turn off the display and hard disks.

## How to fix violations
Set timer intervals to occur less than one time per second.

## When to suppress warnings
This rule should be suppressed only if firing the timer more than one time per second is required and mobility considerations can safely be ignored.
