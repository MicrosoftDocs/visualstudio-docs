# CA1704: Identifiers should be spelled correctly

## Cause

The name of an identifier contains one or more words that are not recognized by the Microsoft spelling checker library. This rule does not check constructors or special-named members such as get and set property accessors.

## Rule description

This rule parses the identifier into tokens and checks the spelling of each token. The parsing algorithm performs the following transformations:

- Uppercase letters start a new token. For example, MyNameIsJoe tokenizes to "My", "Name", "Is", "Joe".

- For multiple uppercase letters, the last uppercase letter starts a new token. For example, GUIEditor tokenizes to "GUI", "Editor".

- Leading and trailing apostrophes are removed. For example, 'sender' tokenizes to "sender".

- Underscores signify the end of a token and are removed. For example, Hello_world tokenizes to "Hello", "world".

- Embedded ampersands are removed. For example, for&mat tokenizes to "format".

## Language

The spell checker currently checks only against English-based culture dictionaries. You can change the culture of your project in the project file, by adding the **CodeAnalysisCulture** element.

For example:

```xml
<Project ...>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <CodeAnalysisCulture>en-AU</CodeAnalysisCulture>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you set the culture to anything other than an English-based culture, this code analysis rule is silently disabled.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, correct the spelling of the word or add the word to a custom dictionary.

### To add words to a custom dictionary

Name the custom dictionary XML file *CustomDictionary.xml*. Place the dictionary in the installation directory of the tool, the project directory, or in the directory that is associated with the tool under the profile of the user (*%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\\...*). To learn how to add the custom dictionary to a project in Visual Studio, see [How to: Customize the Code Analysis Dictionary](../code-quality/how-to-customize-the-code-analysis-dictionary.md).

- Add words that should not cause a violation under the Dictionary/Words/Recognized path.

- Add words that should cause a violation under the Dictionary/Words/Unrecognized path.

- Add words that should be flagged as obsolete under the Dictionary/Words/Deprecated path. See the related rule topic [CA1726: Use preferred terms](../code-quality/ca1726.md) for more information.

- Add exceptions to the acronym casing rules to the Dictionary/Acronyms/CasingExceptions path.

The following is an example of the structure of a custom dictionary file:

```xml
<Dictionary>
   <Words>
      <Unrecognized>
         <Word>cb</Word>
      </Unrecognized>
      <Recognized>
         <Word>stylesheet</Word>
         <Word>GotDotNet</Word>
      </Recognized>
      <Deprecated>
         <Term PreferredAlternate="EnterpriseServices">ComPlus</Term>
      </Deprecated>
   </Words>
   <Acronyms>
      <CasingExceptions>
         <Acronym>CJK</Acronym>
         <Acronym>Pi</Acronym>
      </CasingExceptions>
   </Acronyms>
</Dictionary>
```

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a warning from this rule only if the word is intentionally misspelled and the word applies to a limited set of the library. Correctly spelled words reduce the learning curve that is required for new software libraries.
