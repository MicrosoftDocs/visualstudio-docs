# CA1048: Do not declare virtual members in sealed types

## Cause
A public type is sealed and declares a method that is both `virtual` (`Overridable` in Visual Basic) and not final. This rule does not report violations for delegate types, which must follow this pattern.

## Rule description
Types declare methods as virtual so that inheriting types can override the implementation of the virtual method. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, making a virtual method on a sealed type meaningless.

The Visual Basic and C# compilers do not allow types to violate this rule.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, make the method non-virtual or make the type inheritable.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.

## Example
The following example shows a type that violates this rule.
