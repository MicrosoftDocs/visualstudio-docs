# C6313
warning C6313: Incorrect operator: Zero-valued flag cannot be tested with bitwise-and. Use an equality test to check for zero-valued flags  
  
 This warning indicates that a constant value of zero was provided as an argument to the bitwise-and (`&`) operator in a test context. The resulting expression is constant and evaluates to false; the result is different than intended.  
  
 This is typically caused by using bitwise-and to test for a flag that has the value zero. To test zero-valued flags, a test for equality must be performed, for example, using `==` or `!=`.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#define FLAG 0  
  
void f(int Flags )  
{  
  if (Flags & FLAG)  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
#define FLAG 0  
  
void f(int Flags )  
{  
  if (Flags == FLAG)  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```
