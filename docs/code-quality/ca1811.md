# CA1811: Avoid uncalled private code

|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
A private or internal (assembly-level) member does not have callers in the assembly, is not invoked by the common language runtime, and is not invoked by a delegate. The following members are not checked by this rule:

- Explicit interface members.

- Static constructors.

- Serialization constructors.

- Methods marked with <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName>.

- Members that are overrides.

## Rule description
This rule can report false positives if entry points occur that are not currently identified by the rule logic. Also, a compiler may emit noncallable code into an assembly.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the noncallable code or add code that calls it.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule. To do so, see [Suppress code analysis warnings](../code-quality/in-source-suppression-overview.md).
