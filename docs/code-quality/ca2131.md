## Cause
A type participates in type equivalence and a either the type itself, or a member or field of the type, is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute.

## Rule description
This rule fires on any critical types or types that contain critical methods or fields that are participating in type equivalence. When the CLR detects such a type, it fails to load it with a <xref:System.TypeLoadException> at run time. Typically, this rule fires only when users implement type equivalence manually rather than by relying on tlbimp and the compilers to do the type equivalence.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the SecurityCritical attribute.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following examples demonstrate an interface, a method, and a field that will cause this rule to fire.
