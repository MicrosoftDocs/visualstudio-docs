# C6284
warning C6284: object passed as parameter '%d' when string is required in call to \<function>.

 This warning indicates that the format string specifies a string, for example, a `%s` specification for `printf` or `scanf`, but a C++ object has been passed instead.

 This defect might produce incorrect output or crashes.

 This message is often reported due to passing a C++ object implementing some string type, for example, `std::string`, `CComBSTR` or `bstr_t`, into a C `printf`-style call. Depending on the implementation of the C++ class, that is, if the proper cast operators are defined, C++ string objects can often be used transparently whenever C strings are required; however, because parameters to `printf`-style functions are essentially untyped, no conversion to a string occurs.

 Depending on the object, it might be appropriate to insert a `static_cast` operator to the appropriate string type, for example, `char *` or `TCHAR``*`, or to call a member function which returns a string, for example, `c_str()`, on instances of `std::string`.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning because a `CComBSTR` is passed to the `sprintf` function:

```cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void f()
{
  char buff[50];
  CComBSTR bstrValue("Bye");

  sprintf(buff,"%ws",bstrValue);
}
```

 The following code uses static cast to correct this warning:

```cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void f()
{
  char buff[50];
  CComBSTR bstrValue("Bye");

  sprintf_s(buff,50,"%ws",static_cast<wchar_t *>(bstrValue));
}
```
