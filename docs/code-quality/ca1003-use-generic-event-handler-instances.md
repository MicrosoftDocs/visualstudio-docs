## Cause  
 A type contains a delegate that returns void, whose signature contains two parameters (the first an object and the second a type that is assignable to EventArgs), and the containing assembly targets [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnlong_md.md)].  
  
## Rule Description  
 Before [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnlong_md.md)], in order to pass custom information to the event handler, a new delegate had to be declared that specified a class that was derived from the <xref:System.EventArgs?displayProperty=fullName> class. This is no longer true in [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnlong_md.md)], which introduced the <xref:System.EventHandler%601?displayProperty=fullName> delegate. This generic delegate allows any class that is derived from <xref:System.EventArgs> to be used together with the event handler.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the delegate and replace its use by using the <xref:System.EventHandler%601?displayProperty=fullName> delegate. If the delegate is autogenerated by the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler, change the syntax of the event declaration to use the <xref:System.EventHandler%601?displayProperty=fullName> delegate.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a delegate that violates the rule. In the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] example, comments describe how to modify the example to satisfy the rule. For the C# example, an example follows that shows the modified code.  
  
 [!code-vb[FxCop.Design.CustomEventHandler#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1003-use-generic-event-handler-instances_1.vb)]
 [!code-cs[FxCop.Design.CustomEventHandler#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1003-use-generic-event-handler-instances_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example removes the delegate declaration from the previous example, which satisfies the rule, and replaces its use in the `ClassThatRaisesEvent` and `ClassThatHandlesEvent` methods by using the <xref:System.EventHandler%601?displayProperty=fullName> delegate.
