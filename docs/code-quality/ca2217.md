# CA2217: Do not mark enums with FlagsAttribute

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA2217|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

An enumeration is marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> and it has one or more values that are not powers of two or a combination of the other defined values on the enumeration.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible enumerations, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

An enumeration should have <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> present only if each value defined in the enumeration is a power of two or a combination of defined values.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> from the enumeration.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca2217.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Usage). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Examples

The following code shows an enumeration, `Color`, that contains the value 3. 3 is not a power of two, or a combination of any of the defined values. The `Color` enumeration shouldn't be marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute>.

[!code-vb[FxCop.Usage.EnumNoFlags#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca2217-do-not-mark-enums-with-flagsattribute_1.vb)]

The following code shows an enumeration, `Days`, that meets the requirements for being marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute>:
