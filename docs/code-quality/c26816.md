# Warning C26816 The pointer points to memory allocated on the stack

The pointer points to a variable that was allocated on the stack and is cleaned up when it goes out of scope, which causes the pointer to be invalid.


## Example

```cpp
// In this example, std::string is being used internaly because the implementer felt it was easier to 
// perform the non-trivial initialization of the value but the function returns a C-style string.
const char *danglingRawPtrFromLocal() {
  std::string s;
  
  // interesting string initialization here
  
  return s.c_str(); // Oops, The pointer points to memory allocated on the stack
}
```

The fix is to eliminate the use of the pointer to the stack.  In this example we address the warning by returning the std::string.
It could also be addressed by copying the data to the heap or adding an "out" variable to the function parameter list.

```cpp
std::string danglingRawPtrFromLocal() {
  std::string s;
  
  // interesting string initialization here
  
  return s;
}
```
