# CA1801: Review unused parameters

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1801|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking - If the member is not visible outside the assembly, regardless of the change you make.<br /><br /> Non-breaking - If you change the member to use the parameter within its body.<br /><br /> Breaking - If you remove the parameter and it is visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause

A method signature includes a parameter that's not used in the method body.

This rule does not examine the following kinds of methods:

- Methods referenced by a delegate.

- Methods used as event handlers.

- Serialization constructors ([see guidelines](/dotnet/standard/serialization/serialization-guidelines#supporting-runtime-serialization)).

- Serialization <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable.GetObjectData> method.

- Methods declared with the `abstract` (`MustOverride` in Visual Basic) modifier.

- Methods declared with the `virtual` (`Overridable` in Visual Basic) modifier.

- Methods declared with the `override` (`Overrides` in Visual Basic) modifier.

- Methods declared with the `extern` (`Declare` statement in Visual Basic) modifier.

If you're using [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md), this rule does not flag parameters that are named with the [discard](/dotnet/csharp/discards) symbol, for example, `_`, `_1`, and `_2`. This reduces warning noise on parameters that are needed for signature requirements, for example, a method used as a delegate, a parameter with special attributes, or a parameter whose value is implicitly accessed at run time by a framework but is not referenced in code.

## Rule description

Review parameters in non-virtual methods that are not used in the method body to make sure no incorrectness exists around failure to access them. Unused parameters incur maintenance and performance costs.

Sometimes, a violation of this rule can point to an implementation bug in the method. For example, the parameter should have been used in the method body. Suppress warnings of this rule if the parameter must exist because of backward compatibility.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the unused parameter (a breaking change), or use the parameter in the method body (a non-breaking change).

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule:

- In previously shipped code for which the fix would be a breaking change.

- For the `this` parameter in a custom extension method for <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.Assert?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The functions in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.Assert> class are static, so there's no need to access the `this` parameter in the method body.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1801.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Performance). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example

The following example shows two methods. One method violates the rule and the other method satisfies the rule.
