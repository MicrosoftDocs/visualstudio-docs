# CA1806: Do not ignore method results

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1806|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

There are several possible reasons for this warning:

- A new object is created but never used.

- A method that creates and returns a new string is called and the new string is never used.

- A COM or P/Invoke method that returns a HRESULT or error code that is never used.

- A LINQ method that returns a result that is never used.

## Rule description

Unnecessary object creation and the associated garbage collection of the unused object degrade performance.

Strings are immutable and methods such as String.ToUpper returns a new instance of a string instead of modifying the instance of the string in the calling method.

Ignoring HRESULT or error code can lead to unexpected behavior in error conditions or to low-resource conditions.

LINQ methods are known to not have side effects, and the result should not be ignored.

## How to fix violations

If method A creates a new instance of B object that is never used, pass the instance as an argument to another method or assign the instance to a variable. If the object creation is unnecessary, remove the it.

-or-

If method A calls method B, but does not use the new string instance that the method B returns, pass the instance as an argument to another method, assign the instance to a variable. Or remove the call if it is unnecessary.

-or-

If method A calls method B, but does not use the HRESULT or error code that the method returns, use the result in a conditional statement, assign the result to a variable, or pass it as an argument to another method.

-or-

If a LINQ method A calls method B, but does not use the result, use the result in a conditional statement, assign the result to a variable, or pass it as an argument to another method.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the act of creating the object serves some purpose.

## Example

The following example shows a class that ignores the result of calling String.Trim.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults3#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_1.cs)]
[!code-vb[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults3#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_1.vb)]
[!code-cpp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults3#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CPP/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_1.cpp)]

## Example

The following example fixes the previous violation by assigning the result of String.Trim back to the variable it was called on.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults4#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_2.cs)]
[!code-vb[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults4#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_2.vb)]
[!code-cpp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults4#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CPP/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_2.cpp)]

## Example

The following example shows a method that does not use an object that it creates.

> [!NOTE]
> This violation cannot be reproduced in Visual Basic.

[!code-cpp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults5#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CPP/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_3.cpp)]
[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults5#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_3.cs)]

## Example

The following example fixes the previous violation by removing the unnecessary creation of an object.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults6#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_4.cs)]
[!code-cpp[FxCop.Usage.DoNotIgnoreMethodResults6#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CPP/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_4.cpp)]

<!-- Examples don't exist for the below... -->
<!--
## Example
The following example shows a method that ignores the error code that the native method GetShortPathName returns.

## Example
The following example fixes the previous violation by checking the error code and throwing an exception when the call fails.
