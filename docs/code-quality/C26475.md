# C26475 NO_FUNCTION_STYLE_CASTS

"Do not use function style C-casts."

**C++ Core Guidelines**:
ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast

Function style casts (e.g. "int(1.1)") are another incarnation of C-style casts (like "(int)1.1") with all its questionable safety. Specifically, compiler doesn’t try to check if any data loss can occur neither in C-casts, nor in function casts. In both cases it is better either to avoid casting or use brace initializer if possible. If neither works, static casts may be suitable, but it is still better to use utilities from the Guidelines Support Library:
- gsl::narrow ensures lossless conversion and causes runtime crash if it is not possible.
- gsl::narrow_cast clearly states that conversion can lose data and it is acceptable.

## Remarks
- This rule fires only for constants of primitive types - these are the cases where compiler can clearly detect data loss and emit error if brace initializer is used. The cases which would require runtime execution are flagged by C26493 NO_CSTYLE_CAST.
  - Default initializers are not flagged (e.g. "int()").

## Example

dangerous conversion

```cpp
constexpr auto planck_constant = float( 6.62607004082e-34 ); // C26475
```

```cpp
dangerous conversion – detecting potential data loss
constexpr auto planck_constant = float{ 6.62607004082e-34 }; // Error C2397
```

```cpp
dangerous conversion – corrected
constexpr auto planck_constant = double{ 6.62607004082e-34 };
```
