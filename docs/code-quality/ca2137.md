## Cause
A method contains unverifiable code or returns a type by reference.

## Rule description
This rule fires on attempts by security transparent code to execute unverifiable MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language). However, the rule does not contain a full IL verifier, and instead uses heuristics to catch most violations of MSIL verification.

To be certain that your code contains only verifiable MSIL, run [Peverify.exe (PEVerify Tool)](/dotnet/framework/tools/peverify-exe-peverify-tool) on your assembly. Run PEVerify with the **/transparent** option which limits the output to only unverifiable transparent methods which would cause an error. If the /transparent option is not used, PEVerify also verifies critical methods that are allowed to contain unverifiable code.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, mark the method with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> or <xref:System.Security.SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute> attribute, or remove the unverifiable code.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The method in this example uses unverifiable code and should be marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> or <xref:System.Security.SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute> attribute.
