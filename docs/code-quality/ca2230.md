# CA2230: Use params for variable arguments

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2230|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A public or protected type contains a public or protected method that uses the `VarArgs` calling convention.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
The `VarArgs` calling convention is used with certain method definitions that take a variable number of parameters. A method using the `VarArgs` calling convention is not Common Language Specification (CLS) compliant and might not be accessible across programming languages.

In C#, the `VarArgs` calling convention is used when a method's parameter list ends with the `__arglist` keyword. Visual Basic does not support the `VarArgs` calling convention, and C++  allows its use only in unmanaged code that uses the ellipse `...` notation.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule in C#, use the [params](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/params) keyword instead of `__arglist`.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following example shows two methods, one that violates the rule and one that satisfies the rule.
