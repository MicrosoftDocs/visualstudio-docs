# CA1901: P/Invoke declarations should be portable

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1901|
|Category|Microsoft.Portability|
|Breaking change|Breaking - If the P/Invoke is visible outside the assembly. Non-breaking - If the P/Invoke is not visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause
This rule evaluates the size of each parameter and the return value of a P/Invoke and verifies that their size, when marshaled to unmanaged code on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, is correct. The most common violation of this rule is to pass a fixed-sized integer where a platform-dependent, pointer-sized variable is required.

> [!NOTE]
> This legacy rule is not available in FxCop Analyzers. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-rule-port-status.md#deprecated-rules).

## Rule description
Either of the following scenarios violates this rule occurs:

- The return value or parameter is typed as a fixed-size integer when it should be typed as an `IntPtr`.

- The return value or parameter is typed as an `IntPtr` when it should be typed as a fixed-size integer.

## How to fix violations
You can fix this violation by using `IntPtr` or `UIntPtr` to represent handles instead of `Int32` or `UInt32`.

## When to suppress warnings
You should not suppress this warning.

## Example
The following example demonstrates a violation of this rule.

```csharp
internal class NativeMethods
{
    [DllImport("shell32.dll", CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
    internal static extern IntPtr ExtractIcon(IntPtr hInst,
        string lpszExeFileName, IntPtr nIconIndex);
}
```

In this example, the `nIconIndex` parameter is declared as an `IntPtr`, which is 4 bytes wide on a 32-bit platform and 8 bytes wide on a 64-bit platform. In the unmanaged declaration that follows, you can see that `nIconIndex` is a 4-byte unsigned integer on all platforms.

```csharp
HICON ExtractIcon(HINSTANCE hInst, LPCTSTR lpszExeFileName,
    UINT nIconIndex);
```

## Example
To fix the violation, change the declaration to the following:

```csharp
internal class NativeMethods{
    [DllImport("shell32.dll", CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]
    internal static extern IntPtr ExtractIcon(IntPtr hInst,
        string lpszExeFileName, uint nIconIndex);
}
```
