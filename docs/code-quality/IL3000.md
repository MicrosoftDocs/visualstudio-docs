# IL3000: Avoid using accessing Assembly file path when publishing as a single-file

## Cause

When publishing as a single-file (e.g., by setting the PublishSingleFile property in a project to true) calling the Assembly.Location property is likely
a mistake since the property will always return an empty string.

## How to fix violations

If the app needs only needs the containing directory for the single-file bundle, consider using the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` property instead.

## When to suppress warnings

If the assembly which is the receiver of the Assembly.Location access is definitely not in the single-file bundle it is appropriate to silence this warning.
