# CA1007: Use generics where appropriate

## Cause
An externally visible method contains a reference parameter of type <xref:System.Object?displayProperty=fullName>, and the containing assembly targets .NET Framework 2.0.

## Rule description
A reference parameter is a parameter that is modified by using the `ref` (`ByRef` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]) keyword. The argument type that is supplied for a reference parameter must exactly match the reference parameter type. To use a type that is derived from the reference parameter type, the type must first be cast and assigned to a variable of the reference parameter type. Use of a generic method allows all types, subject to constraints, to be passed to the method without first casting the type to the reference parameter type.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, make the method generic and replace the <xref:System.Object> parameter by using a type parameter.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following example shows a general-purpose swap routine that is implemented as both nongeneric and generic methods. Note how efficiently the strings are swapped by using the generic method compared to the nongeneric method.
