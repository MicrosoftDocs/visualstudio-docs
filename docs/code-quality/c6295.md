# C6295
warning C6295: Ill-defined for-loop: \<variable> values are of the range "min" to "max". Loop executed indefinitely  
  
 This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended. The for-loop tests an unsigned value against zero (0) with >=. The result is always true, therefore the loop is infinite.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f( )  
{  
  for (unsigned int i = 100; i >= 0; i--)   
  {  
    // code ...  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
void f( )  
{  
   for (unsigned int i = 100; i > 0; i--)  
   {  
      // code ...  
   }  
}  
```
