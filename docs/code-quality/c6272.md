# C6272
warning C6272: non-float passed as argument \<number> when float is required in call to \<function>  
  
 This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a float is required, for example, a `%f` or `%g` specification for `printf,` but a non-float such as an integer or string is being passed. This defect is likely to result in incorrect output; however, in certain circumstances it could result in a crash.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <string.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
   char buff[5];  
   int i=5;  
  
   sprintf(buff,"%s %f","a",i);   
}  
  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use `%i` instead of `%f` specification as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <string.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
   char buff[5];  
   int i=5;  
  
   sprintf(buff,"%s %i","a",i);    
}  
```  
  
 The following code uses the safe string manipulation function, `sprintf_s`, to correct this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <string.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
   char buff[5];  
   int i=5;  
  
   sprintf_s(buff,5,"%s %i","a",i); // safe version  
}  
```
