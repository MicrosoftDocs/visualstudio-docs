# CA1005: Avoid excessive parameters on generic types

## Cause
An externally visible generic type has more than two type parameters.

## Rule description
The more type parameters a generic type contains, the more difficult it is to know and remember what each type parameter represents. It is usually obvious with one type parameter, as in `List<T>`, and in certain cases with two type parameters, as in `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`. If more than two type parameters exist, the difficulty becomes too great for most users (for example, `TooManyTypeParameters<T, K, V>` in C# or `TooManyTypeParameters(Of T, K, V)` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]).

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use no more than two type parameters.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the design absolutely requires more than two type parameters. Providing generics in a syntax that is easy to understand and use reduces the time that is required to learn and increases the adoption rate of new libraries.

## Configurability
Starting with version 3.0.0 of the analyzer package, If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1005.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).
