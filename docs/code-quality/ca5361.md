## Cause

## Rule description

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.6, the System.Net.ServicePointManager and System.Net.Security.SslStream classes are recommeded to use new protocols. The old ones have protocol weaknesses and are not supported. Setting Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto with true will use the old weak crypto check and opt out of the protocol migration.
