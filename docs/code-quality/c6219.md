# C6219
warning C6219: Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to 1 or TRUE. Consider using [SUCCEEDED](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=92738) or [FAILED](ms-help://MS.VSCC.2003/MS.MSDNQTR.2003FEB.1033/com/htm/error_899v.htm) macro instead  
  
 This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being compared with an explicit, non-`HRESULT` value of one (1). This is likely to lead to incorrect results because the typical success value of `HRESULT` (`S_OK`) is 0; comparing it to a Boolean type will implicitly convert it to false.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because the `CoGetMalloc` returns an `HRESULT`, which then is compared to `TRUE`:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
void f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);  
  
  if (hr == TRUE)  
  {  
    // success code ...  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // failure code     
  }  
}  
```  
  
 Most of the time, this warning is caused by the code mistakenly testing an `HRESULT` against a Boolean. It is generally best to use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros to test the value of an `HRESULT`. To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
void f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);  
  
  if (SUCCEEDED(hr))  
  {  
    // success code ...  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // failure code     
  }  
}  
```  
  
 For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.  
  
 Note that the use of malloc and free (and related dynamic memory APIs) have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](/visual-cpp/standard-library/shared-ptr-class), [unique_ptr](/visual-cpp/standard-library/unique-ptr-class), and [vector](../Topic/%3Cvector%3E.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](/visual-cpp/cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp) and [C++ Standard Library](/visual-cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference).
