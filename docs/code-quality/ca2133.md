> [!NOTE]
> This warning is only applied to code that is running the CoreCLR (the version of the CLR that is specific to Silverlight web applications).

## Cause

This warning fires on a method that binds a delegate that is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> to a method that is transparent or that is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute>. The warning also fires a method that binds a delegate that is transparent or safe-critical to a critical method.

## Rule description

Delegate types and the methods that they bind to must have consistent transparency. Transparent and safe-critical delegates may only bind to other transparent or safe-critical methods. Similarly, critical delegates may only bind to critical methods. These binding rules ensure that the only code that can invoke a method via a delegate could have also invoked the same method directly. For example, binding rules prevent transparent code from calling critical code directly via a transparent delegate.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this warning, change the transparency of the delegate or of the method that it binds so that the transparency of the two are equivalent.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
