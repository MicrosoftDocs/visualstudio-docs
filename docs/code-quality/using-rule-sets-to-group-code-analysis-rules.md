# Use rule sets to group code analysis rules

When you configure code analysis in Visual Studio, you can choose from a list of built-in *rule sets*. A rule set is a grouping of code analysis rules that identify targeted issues and specific conditions for that project. For example, you can apply a rule set that's designed to scan code for publicly available APIs. You can also apply a rule set that includes all the available rules.

You can customize a rule set by adding or deleting rules or by changing rule severities to appear as either warnings or errors in the **Error List**. Customized rule sets can fulfill a need for your particular development environment. When you customize a rule set, the rule set editor provides search and filtering tools to help you in the process.

Rule sets are available for [managed code analysis](analyzer-rule-sets.md), [legacy analysis of managed code](how-to-configure-code-analysis-for-a-managed-code-project.md), and [C++ code analysis](/cpp/code-quality/using-rule-sets-to-specify-the-cpp-rules-to-run).

## Rule set format

A rule set is specified in XML format in a *.ruleset* file. Rules, which consist of an ID and an *action*, are grouped by analyzer ID and namespace in the file.

The contents of a *.ruleset* file looks similar to this XML:

```xml
<RuleSet Name="Rules for Hello World project" Description="These rules focus on critical issues for the Hello World app." ToolsVersion="10.0">
  <Localization ResourceAssembly="Microsoft.VisualStudio.CodeAnalysis.RuleSets.Strings.dll" ResourceBaseName="Microsoft.VisualStudio.CodeAnalysis.RuleSets.Strings.Localized">
    <Name Resource="HelloWorldRules_Name" />
    <Description Resource="HelloWorldRules_Description" />
  </Localization>
  <Rules AnalyzerId="Microsoft.Analyzers.ManagedCodeAnalysis" RuleNamespace="Microsoft.Rules.Managed">
    <Rule Id="CA1001" Action="Warning" />
    <Rule Id="CA1009" Action="Warning" />
    <Rule Id="CA1016" Action="Warning" />
    <Rule Id="CA1033" Action="Warning" />
  </Rules>
  <Rules AnalyzerId="Microsoft.CodeQuality.Analyzers" RuleNamespace="Microsoft.CodeQuality.Analyzers">
    <Rule Id="CA1802" Action="Error" />
    <Rule Id="CA1814" Action="Info" />
    <Rule Id="CA1823" Action="None" />
    <Rule Id="CA2217" Action="Warning" />
  </Rules>
</RuleSet>
```

> [!TIP]
> It's easier to [edit a rule set](../code-quality/working-in-the-code-analysis-rule-set-editor.md) in the graphical **Rule Set Editor** than by hand.

## Specify a rule set for a project

The rule set for a project is specified by the **CodeAnalysisRuleSet** property in the Visual Studio project file. For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' ">
  ...
  <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>HelloWorld.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
</PropertyGroup>
```
