# CA2002: Do not lock on objects with weak identity

## Cause

A thread attempts to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity.

## Rule description

An object is said to have a weak identity when it can be directly accessed across application domain boundaries. A thread that tries to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object.

The following types have a weak identity and are flagged by the rule:

- <xref:System.String>

- Arrays of value types, including [integral types](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/integral-types-table), [floating-point types](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/floating-point-types-table), and <xref:System.Boolean>.

- <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>

- <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException>

- <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>

- <xref:System.StackOverflowException>

- <xref:System.Reflection.MemberInfo>

- <xref:System.Reflection.ParameterInfo>

- <xref:System.Threading.Thread>

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use an object from a type that is not in the list in the Description section.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following example shows some object locks that violate the rule.
