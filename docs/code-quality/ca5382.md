# CA5382: Use secure cookies in ASP.NET Core

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA5382|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure?displayProperty=fullName> property is set as `false` when invoking <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. For now, this rule only looks at the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal.ResponseCookies class, which is one of the implementations of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies>.

This rule is similar to [CA5383](ca5383.md), but analysis can determine that the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure> property is definitely `false` or not set.

## Rule description

Applications available over HTTPS must use secure cookies, which indicate to the browser that the cookie should only be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## How to fix violations

Set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure> property as `true`.

## When to suppress warnings

- If cookies are configured to be secure by default, such as using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.CookiePolicy.CookiePolicyMiddleware?displayProperty=fullName> in `Startup.Configure`:

```
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.UseCookiePolicy(
            new CookiePolicyOptions
            {
                Secure = CookieSecurePolicy.Always
            });
    }
}
```

- If you're sure there's no sensitive data in the cookies.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), this rule is configurable.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5382.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):
  - Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
  - Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, "T:" prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
  - `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5382.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5382.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5382.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5382.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

The following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string key, string value)
    {
        var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions();
        cookieOptions.Secure = false;
        var responseCookies = new ResponseCookies(null, null); 
        responseCookies.Append(key, value, cookieOptions);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string key, string value)
    {
        var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions();
        cookieOptions.Secure = true;
        var responseCookies = new ResponseCookies(null, null); 
        responseCookies.Append(key, value, cookieOptions);
    }
}
```
