## Cause

The name of an identifier contains the underscore (\_) character.

## Rule description

By convention, identifier names do not contain the underscore (\_) character. The rule checks namespaces, types, members, and parameters.

Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This reduces the learning curve that is required for new software libraries, and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

## How to fix violations

Remove all underscore characters from the name.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress warnings for production code. However, it's safe to suppress this warning for test code. You can suppress warnings from this rule by setting its [severity](use-roslyn-analyzers.md#rule-severity) to **none**.
