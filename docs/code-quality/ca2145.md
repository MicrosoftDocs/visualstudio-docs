# CA2145: Transparent methods should not be decorated with the SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2145|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A transparent method, a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute> attribute, or a type that contains a method is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute> attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description

Methods decorated with the <xref:System.Security.SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute> attribute have an implicit LinkDemand placed upon any method that calls it. This LinkDemand requires that the calling code be security critical. Marking the method that uses SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute makes this requirement more obvious for callers of the method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, mark the method or type with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
