# CA1410: COM registration methods should be matched

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1410|
|Category|Microsoft.Interoperability|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type declares a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute but does not declare a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute, or vice versa.

## Rule description

For Component Object Model (COM) clients to create a .NET type, the type must first be registered. If it is available, a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute> attribute is called during the registration process to run user-specified code. A corresponding method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute> attribute is called during the unregistration process to reverse the operations of the registration method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the corresponding registration or unregistration method.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates the rule. The commented code shows the fix for the violation.
