# CA3007: Review code for open redirect vulnerabilities

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches an HTTP response redirect.

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input, be mindful of open redirect vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit an open redirect vulnerability to use your website to give the appearance of a legitimate URL, but redirect an unsuspecting visitor to a phishing or other malicious webpage.

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching an HTTP redirect URL.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that responds with an HTTP redirect, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Some approaches to fixing open redirect vulnerabilities include:

- Don't allow users to initiate redirects.
- Don't allow users to specify any part of the URL in a redirect scenario.
- Restrict redirects to a predefined "allow list" of URLs.
- Validate redirect URLs.
- If applicable, consider using a disclaimer page when users are being redirected away from your site.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know you've validated the input to be restricted to intended URLs, it's okay to suppress this warning.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string input = Request.Form["url"];
        this.Response.Redirect(input);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Dim input As String = Me.Request.Form("url")
        Me.Response.Redirect(input)
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string input = Request.Form["in"];
        if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))
        {
            this.Response.Redirect("https://example.org/login.html");
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Dim input As String = Me.Request.Form("in")
        If String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input) Then
            Me.Response.Redirect("https://example.org/login.html")
        End If
    End Sub
End Class
```
