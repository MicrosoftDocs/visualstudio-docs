# CA1068: CancellationToken parameters must come last

## Cause

A method has a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> parameter that is not the last parameter.

## Rule description

Methods that perform long running operations or asynchronous operations and are cancelable normally take a cancellation token parameter. Each cancellation token has a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource> that creates the token and uses it for cancelable computations. It is common practice to have a long chain of method calls that pass around the cancellation token from the callers to the callees. Hence, a large number of methods that take part in a cancelable computation end up having a cancellation token parameter. However, the cancellation token itself is not usually relevant to the core functionality of a majority of these methods. It's considered a good API design practice to have such parameters be the last parameter in the list.

### Special cases
Rule CA1068 does not fire in the following special cases:
- Method has one or more [optional](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments) parameters ([Optional](/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/optional-parameters) in Visual Basic) following a non-optional cancellation token parameter. The compiler requires that all optional parameters are defined after all the non-optional parameters.
- Method has one or more [ref](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref) or [out](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier) parameters ([ByRef](/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/byref) in Visual Basic) following a cancellation token parameter. It is common practice to have `ref` or `out` parameters be at the end of the list, because they usually indicate output values for the method.

> [!NOTE]
> Rule CA1068 is not available in legacy analysis. It was first introduced in [FxCop analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers).

## How to fix violations

Change the method signature to move the cancellation token parameter to the end of the list. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
// Violates CA1068
public void LongRunningOperation(CancellationToken token, string usefulParameter)
{
    ...
}
```

```csharp
// Does not violate CA1068
public void LongRunningOperation(string usefulParameter, CancellationToken token)
{
    ...
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

If the method is an externally visible public API that is already part of a shipped library, then it is safe to suppress a warning from this rule to avoid a breaking change for the library consumers.

## Configurability

[Roslyn analyzers issue 2851](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/2851) tracks making the rule configurable in the [FxCopAnalyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers) package. Once it's implemented, you can configure the API surface on which rule executes to avoid having to use source suppressions.
