## Cause
A public or protected method in a public type overrides a method or implements an interface, and does not have the same [Link Demands](/dotnet/framework/misc/link-demands) as the interface or virtual method.

## Rule description
This rule matches a method to its base method, which is either an interface or a virtual method in another type, and then compares the link demands on each. A violation is reported if either the method or the base method has a link demand and the other does not.

If this rule is violated, a malicious caller can bypass the link demand merely by calling the unsecured method.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, apply the same link demand to the override method or implementation. If this is not possible, mark the method with a full demand or remove the attribute altogether.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following example shows various violations of this rule.
