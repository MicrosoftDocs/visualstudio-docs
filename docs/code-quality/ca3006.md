# CA3006: Review code for process command injection vulnerabilities

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA3006|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches a process command.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input, be mindful of command injection attacks. A command injection attack can execute malicious commands on the underlying operating system, compromising the security and integrity of your server.

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching a process command.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that starts a process, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

- If possible, avoid starting processes based on user input.
- Validate input against a known safe set of characters and length.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know the input has been validated or escaped to be safe, it's safe to suppress this warning.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure the analysis for this rule.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3006.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):
  - Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
  - Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, "T:" prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
  - `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3006.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3006.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3006.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3006.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string input = Request.Form["in"];
        Process p = Process.Start(input);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Diagnostics

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs as EventArgs)
        Dim input As String = Me.Request.Form("in")
        Dim p As Process = Process.Start(input)
    End Sub
End Class
```
