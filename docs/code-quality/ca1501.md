# CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance

|CheckId|CA1501|

|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause

A type is more than four levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy.

By default, the rule only excludes all types from the `System` namespace, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain. This rule limits analysis to hierarchies in the same module.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, derive the type from a base type that is less deep in the inheritance hierarchy or eliminate some of the intermediate base types.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule. However, the code might be more difficult to maintain. Note that, depending on the visibility of base types, resolving violations of this rule might create breaking changes. For example, removing public base types is a breaking change.

## Configurability

### Inheritance excluded type or namespace names

You can configure names of types or namespaces (separated by '|'), such that the type or type's namespace doesn't count in the inheritance hierarchy tree. By default, all types from the `System.*` namespace are excluded. Note that no matter which value you are setting, this default value will be added.

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' or whose containing namespace contains 'MyType' and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = MyType1\|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' or whose containing namespace contains either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' in the namespace 'NS' and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS1.MyType1\|T:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with respective fully qualified names and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = N:NS` | Matches all types from the 'NS' namespace and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = My*` | Matches all types whose name starts with 'My' or whose containing namespace parts starts with 'My' and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS.My*` | Matches all types whose name starts with 'My' in the namespace 'NS' and all types from the 'System' namespace |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = N:My*` | Matches all types whose containing namespace starts with 'My' and all types from the 'System' namespace |

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates the rule:

[!code-vb[FxCop.Maintainability.ExcessiveInheritance#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1501-avoid-excessive-inheritance_1.vb)]
