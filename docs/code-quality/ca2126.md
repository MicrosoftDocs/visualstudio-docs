# CA2126: Type link demands require inheritance demands

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2126|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A public unsealed type is protected with a link demand, has an overridable method, and neither the type nor the method is protected with an inheritance demand.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
A link demand on a method or its declaring type requires the immediate caller of the method to have the specified permission. An inheritance demand on a method requires an overriding method to have the specified permission. An inheritance demand on a type requires a deriving class to have the specified permission.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, secure the type or the method with an inheritance demand for the same permission as the link demand.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following example shows a type that violates the rule.
