## Cause
An enumeration contains a member whose name starts with the type name of the enumeration.

## Rule description
Names of enumeration members are not prefixed with the type name because type information is expected to be provided by development tools.

Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This reduces the time that is required for to learn a new software library, and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the type name prefix from the enumeration member.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
The following example shows an incorrectly named enumeration followed by the corrected version.
