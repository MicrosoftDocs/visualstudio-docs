# CA1408: Do not use AutoDual ClassInterfaceType

## Cause
A Component Object Model (COM) visible type is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceAttribute> attribute set to the `AutoDual` value of <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType>.

## Rule description
Types that use a dual interface enable clients to bind to a specific interface layout. Any changes in a future version to the layout of the type or any base types will break COM clients that bind to the interface. By default, if the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceAttribute> attribute is not specified, a dispatch-only interface is used.

Unless marked otherwise, all public nongeneric types are visible to COM; all nonpublic and generic types are invisible to COM.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, change the value of the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceAttribute> attribute to the `None` value of <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType> and explicitly define the interface.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless it is certain that the layout of the type and its base types will not change in a future version.

## Example
The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a re-declaration of the class to use an explicit interface.
