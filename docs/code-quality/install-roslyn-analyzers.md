# Install .NET Compiler Platform code analyzers

Visual Studio includes a core set of .NET Compiler Platform (*Roslyn*) analyzers. These analyzers are always on. You can install additional analyzers either as NuGet packages, or as Visual Studio extensions in *VSIX* files.

## To install NuGet analyzer packages

1. Find the analyzer package you want to install on www.nuget.org.

   For example, you may want to [install the Microsoft FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md#nuget-package) to check your code for security and performance issues, among others. Or, install [StyleCop.Analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/stylecop.analyzers/) to look for style issues in your codebase.

2. Install the package in Visual Studio, using either the [Package Manager Console](/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio#package-manager-console) or the [Package Manager UI](/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio#package-manager-console).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The www.nuget.org page for each analyzer package shows you the command to paste into the **Package Manager Console**. There's even a handy button to copy the text to the clipboard.

   The analyzer assemblies are installed and appear in **Solution Explorer** under **References** > **Analyzers**.

## To install VSIX analyzers

1. In Visual Studio, select **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates**.

   The **Extensions and Updates** dialog box opens.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Alternatively, you can find and download the analyzer extension directly from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).

2. Expand **Online** in the left pane, and then select **Visual Studio Marketplace**.

3. In the search box, type the name of the analyzer extension you want to install. For example, you may want to [install the Microsoft FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md#vsix) to check your code for security and performance issues, among others.

4. Select **Download**.

   The extension is downloaded.

5. Select **OK** to close the dialog box, and then close all instances of Visual Studio to launch the **VSIX Installer**.

   The **VSIX Installer** dialog box opens.
