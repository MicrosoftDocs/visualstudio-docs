# Code analysis rule set reference

When you configure static code analysis for managed code projects in Visual Studio, you can choose from a list of built-in *rule sets*. You can either use one of these built-in rule sets, or you can [customize a rule set](../code-quality/how-to-create-a-custom-rule-set.md) to fit your project requirements.

The topics in this section describe the built-in rule sets and the rules (or warnings) they contain.

> [!NOTE]
> The rule sets in this section pertain to static code analysis. For information about rule sets available for Roslyn analyzer packages, see [Use rule sets with Roslyn analyzers](analyzer-rule-sets.md).
