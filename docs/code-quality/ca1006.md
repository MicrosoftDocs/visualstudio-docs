# CA1006: Do not nest generic types in member signatures

## Cause
An externally visible member has a signature that contains a nested type argument.

## Rule description
A nested type argument is a type argument that is also a generic type. To call a member whose signature contains a nested type argument, the user must instantiate one generic type and pass this type to the constructor of a second generic type. The required procedure and syntax are complex and should be avoided.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to remove the nested type argument.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Providing generics in a syntax that is easy to understand and use reduces the time that is required to learn and increases the adoption rate of new libraries.

## Example
The following example shows a method that violates the rule and the syntax that is required to call the violating method.
