# C6221
warning C6221: Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to an integer. Consider using SUCCEEDED or FAILED macros instead  
  
 This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being compared to an integer other than zero. A success in `HRESULT` (`S_OK`) is represented by a 0. Therefore, an implicit cast of an `HRESULT` to an integer will generate an incorrect value and is likely to lead to the wrong result. It is often caused by mistakenly expecting a function to return an integer when it actually returns an `HRESULT`.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning by comparing `HRESULT` against an integer value:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
HRESULT f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);  
  if (hr == 4)  
  {  
    // failure code ...  
    return S_FALSE;  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // success code ...  
    return S_OK;  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, the following code uses the `FAILED` macro:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
HRESULT f( )  
{  
  HRESULT hr;  
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;  
  
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);  
  if (FAILED(hr))  
  {  
    // failure code ...  
    return S_FALSE;  
  }  
  else  
  {  
    // success code ...  
    return S_OK;  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

 Note that the use of malloc and free (and related dynamic memory allocation APIs) have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](/visual-cpp/standard-library/shared-ptr-class), [unique_ptr](/visual-cpp/standard-library/unique-ptr-class), and [vector](../Topic/%3Cvector%3E.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](/visual-cpp/cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp) and [C++ Standard Library](/visual-cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference).
