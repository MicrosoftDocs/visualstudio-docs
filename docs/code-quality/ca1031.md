# CA1031: Do not catch general exception types

|||
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1031|
|Category|Microsoft.Design|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
A general exception such as <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.SystemException?displayProperty=fullName> is caught in a `catch` statement, or a general catch clause such as `catch()` is used.

By default, this rule only flags general exception types being caught, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description
General exceptions should not be caught.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, catch a more specific exception, or rethrow the general exception as the last statement in the `catch` block.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Catching general exception types can hide run-time problems from the library user and can make debugging more difficult.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the .NET Framework 4, the common language runtime (CLR) no longer delivers corrupted state exceptions that occur in the operating system and managed code, such as access violations in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../code-quality/includes/tlasharptla_mswin_md.md)], to be handled by managed code. If you want to compile an application in the .NET Framework 4 or later versions and maintain handling of corrupted state exceptions, you can apply the <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute to the method that handles the corrupted state exception.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), this rule is configurable.

### Disallowed exception type names

You can configure which exception types are disallowed from being caught. For example, to specify that the rule should flag `catch` handlers with `NullReferenceException`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1031.disallowed_symbol_names = NullReferenceException
```

Allowed type name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):
  - Type name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
  - Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format) with a `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1031.disallowed_symbol_names = ExceptionType` | Matches all symbols named 'ExceptionType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1031.disallowed_symbol_names = ExceptionType1|ExceptionType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'ExceptionType1' or 'ExceptionType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1031.disallowed_symbol_names = T:NS.ExceptionType` | Matches specific types named 'ExceptionType' with given fully qualified name.
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1031.disallowed_symbol_names = T:NS1.ExceptionType1|T:NS1.ExceptionType2` | Matches types named 'ExceptionType1' and 'ExceptionType2' with respective fully qualified names

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example
The following example shows a type that violates this rule and a type that correctly implements the `catch` block.
