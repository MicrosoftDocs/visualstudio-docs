## Cause

## Rule description

Do not create tasks unless you are using one of the overloads that takes a TaskScheduler. The default is to schedule on TaskScheduler.Current, which would lead to deadlocks. Either use TaskScheduler.Default to schedule on the thread pool, or explicitly pass TaskScheduler.Current to make your intentions clear.
