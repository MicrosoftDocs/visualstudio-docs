# CA1412: Mark ComSource Interfaces as IDispatch

|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1412|
|Category|Microsoft.Interoperability|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause

A type is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComSourceInterfacesAttribute> attribute and at least one specified interface is not marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.InterfaceTypeAttribute> attribute set to the `InterfaceIsDispatch` value.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComSourceInterfacesAttribute> is used to identify the event interfaces that a class exposes to Component Object Model (COM) clients. These interfaces must be exposed as `InterfaceIsIDispatch` to enable Visual Basic 6 COM clients to receive event notifications. By default, if an interface is not marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.InterfaceTypeAttribute> attribute, it is exposed as a dual interface.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add or modify the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.InterfaceTypeAttribute> attribute so that its value is set to InterfaceIsIDispatch for all interfaces that are specified with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComSourceInterfacesAttribute> attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following example shows a class where one of the interfaces violates the rule.
