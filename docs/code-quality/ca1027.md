# CA1027: Mark enums with FlagsAttribute

## Cause

The values of an enumeration are powers of two or are combinations of other values that are defined in the enumeration, and the <xref:System.FlagsAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute is not present. To reduce false positives, this rule does not report a violation for enumerations that have contiguous values.

By default, this rule only looks at public enumerations, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

An enumeration is a value type that defines a set of related named constants. Apply <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> to an enumeration when its named constants can be meaningfully combined. For example, consider an enumeration of the days of the week in an application that keeps track of which day's resources are available. If the availability of each resource is encoded by using the enumeration that has <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> present, any combination of days can be represented. Without the attribute, only one day of the week can be represented.

For fields that store combinable enumerations, the individual enumeration values are treated as groups of bits in the field. Therefore, such fields are sometimes referred to as *bit fields*. To combine enumeration values for storage in a bit field, use the Boolean conditional operators. To test a bit field to determine whether a specific enumeration value is present, use the Boolean logical operators. For a bit field to store and retrieve combined enumeration values correctly, each value that is defined in the enumeration must be a power of two. Unless this is so, the Boolean logical operators will not be able to extract the individual enumeration values that are stored in the field.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> to the enumeration.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a warning from this rule if you do not want the enumeration values to be combinable.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1027.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Example

In the following example, `DaysEnumNeedsFlags` is an enumeration that meets the requirements for using <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> but doesn't have it. The `ColorEnumShouldNotHaveFlag` enumeration does not have values that are powers of two but incorrectly specifies <xref:System.FlagsAttribute>. This violates rule [CA2217: Do not mark enums with FlagsAttribute](../code-quality/ca2217.md).
