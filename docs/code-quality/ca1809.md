# CA1809: Avoid excessive locals

## Cause
A member contains more than 64 local variables, some of which might be compiler-generated.

> [!NOTE]
> This legacy rule is not available in FxCop Analyzers. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-rule-port-status.md#deprecated-rules).

## Rule description
A common performance optimization is to store a value in a processor register instead of in memory, which is referred to as *enregistering* the value. The common language runtime considers up to 64 local variables for enregistration. Variables that are not enregistered are put on the stack and must be moved to a register before manipulation. To allow the chance that all local variables get enregistered, limit the number of local variables to 64.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, refactor the implementation to use no more than 64 local variables.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule, or to disable the rule, if performance is not an issue.
