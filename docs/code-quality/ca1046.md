# CA1046: Do not overload operator equals on reference types

## Cause
A public or nested public reference type overloads the equality operator.

## Rule description
For reference types, the default implementation of the equality operator is almost always correct. By default, two references are equal only if they point to the same object.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the implementation of the equality operator.

## When to suppress warnings
It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the reference type behaves like a built-in value type. If it is meaningful to do addition or subtraction on instances of the type, it is probably correct to implement the equality operator and suppress the violation.

## Example
The following example demonstrates the default behavior when comparing two references.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.RefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1046-do-not-overload-operator-equals-on-reference-types_1.cs)]

## Example

The following application compares some references.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.TestRefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1046-do-not-overload-operator-equals-on-reference-types_2.cs)]

This example produces the following output:

```txt
a = new (2,2) and b = new (2,2) are equal? No
c and a are equal? Yes
b and a are == ? No
c and a are == ? Yes
```
