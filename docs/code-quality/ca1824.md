# CA1824: Mark assemblies with NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|CheckId|CA1824|
|Category|Microsoft.Performance|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

An assembly contains a **ResX**-based resource but does not have the <xref:System.Resources.NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> applied to it.

## Rule description

The <xref:System.Resources.NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute> attribute informs the resource manager of an app's default culture. If the default culture's resources are embedded in the app's main assembly, and <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> has to retrieve resources that belong to the same culture as the default culture, the <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> automatically uses the resources located in the main assembly instead of searching for a satellite assembly. This bypasses the usual assembly probe, improves lookup performance for the first resource you load, and can reduce your working set.

> [!TIP]
> See [Packaging and deploying resources](/dotnet/framework/resources/packaging-and-deploying-resources-in-desktop-apps) for the process that <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> uses to probe for resource files.

## Fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the attribute to the assembly, and specify the language of the resources of the neutral culture.

### To specify the neutral language for resources

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project, and then select **Properties**.

2. Select the **Application** tab, and then select **Assembly Information**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project is a .NET Standard or .NET Core project, select the **Package** tab.

3. Select the language from the **Neutral language** or **Assembly neutral language** drop-down list.

4. Select **OK**.

## When to suppress warnings

It is permissible to suppress a warning from this rule. However, startup performance might degrade.
