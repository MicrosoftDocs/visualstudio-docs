# C6103
warning C6103: Returning \<variable> from failed function call at line \<location>.  
  
 A successful path through the function is returning a variable that was used as an `_Out_` parameter to an internal function call that failed.  
  
 The problem might be that the called function and the calling function are not completely annotated. The called function may require `_Always_`, `_Outptr_result_nullonfailure_` (`_COM_Outptr_` for COM code), or a related annotation, and the calling function may require a `_Success_` annotation. Another possible cause for this warning is that the `_Success_` annotation on the called function is incorrect.
