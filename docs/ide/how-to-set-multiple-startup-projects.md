# How to: Set multiple startup projects

Visual Studio allows you to specify how more than one project is run when you start the debugger.

## To set multiple startup projects

1. In **Solution Explorer**, select the solution (the top node).

2. Choose the solution node's context (right-click) menu and then choose **Properties**. The **Solution Property Pages** dialog box appears.

3. Expand the **Common Properties** node, and choose **Startup Project**.

4. Choose the **Multiple Startup Projects** option and set the appropriate actions.
