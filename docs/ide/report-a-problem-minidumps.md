# Create minidumps for a Visual Studio process with all call stacks

In some cases, Microsoft might ask for a minidump of a running Visual Studio process with information for all call stacks. To collect this information, perform these steps:

## Create the minidump file

1. Start a new instance of Visual Studio.
1. From the main menu, choose **Debug** > **Attach To Process**.
1. Check the relevant **Managed** and **Native** check boxes and press **Attach**.

1. Select the other Visual Studio instance to attach to from the list of running processes.
1. From the main menu, choose **Debug** > **Break All**.
1. From the main menu, choose **Debug** > **Save Dump As**.

## Get the call stacks from the minidump

1. Open the dump file in Visual Studio.
1. Go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Debugging** > **Symbols** and make sure that **Microsoft Symbol Servers** is checked in the **Symbol file (.pdb) locations**.
1. Open the **Command** window (**View** > **Other Windows** > **Command Window**)
1. Type ‘~*k’. The window displays all threads' call stacks.
1. Copy all text from Command Window and save to a text file.
1. Attach the txt file to the bug.
