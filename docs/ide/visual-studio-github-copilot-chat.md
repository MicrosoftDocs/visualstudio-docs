## Use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio

You can ask your coding related questions in natural language and GitHub Copilot Chat will answer these in your development context.

There are two places you can ask Copilot these questions; in a [chat window](#ask-questions-in-the-chat-window), or directly inline in the code that you're looking to modify, using [inline chat](#ask-questions-in-the-inline-chat-view). For questions where your goal is to modify or add to the code file you have open in the editor, the inline chat view will usually work best, whereas more general coding questions are best answered in the chat pane.

See [tips to improve Copilot chat](copilot-chat-context.md) results to learn how to use [slash commands](copilot-chat-context.md#slash-commands), [references](copilot-chat-context.md#reference), [sources used](copilot-chat-context.md#find-context), and [threads](copilot-chat-context.md#threads) to get better answers with scoped context in Copilot Chat.

>[!NOTE]
>With Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11, [content exclusion is available for GitHub Copilot Chat](visual-studio-github-copilot-admin.md#github-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio-and-content-exclusions) in Visual Studio. Content excluded by your admin will now be ignored in chat's responses. See [configuring content exclusions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/configuring-content-exclusions-for-github-copilot?tool=visualstudio) to learn more.

### Ask questions in the chat window

The chat window of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio enables you to ask your questions and see answers in the chat pane. It is usually the best way to work with Copilot on programming help and general coding questions.

1. In Visual Studio, select **View** > **GitHub Copilot Chat**.
1. In the Copilot Chat window, type a coding related question in the **Ask Copilot** text box. Press **Enter** or select **Send** to ask your question.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-window-ask-copilot-textbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copilot Chat window.":::
   
   Use the example starter prompts and the prompt library (book icon) in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.12 and later to start exploring GitHub Copilot Chat.

1. If Copilot Chat offers a code suggestion you want to use, select **Copy code block** to copy the code suggestion, **Insert in new files** to insert the code suggestion in a new file, or select **Preview** to insert the code suggestion in your current code file. Using the **Preview** button lets you preview the code in the target location so you can easily see what's being updated.

   If you ask a question for help with understanding your code, **Copy code block** and **Insert in new file** options won't be available.

    1. If you select **Preview**, you'll see the code suggestions in normal Visual Studio diff view pattern. You can review and refine what is being proposed and apply to your code by selecting **Accept** or discard by selecting **Cancel**.

    1. If you select **Insert in new file**, you'll see the code suggestions in a new file. The file is not saved by default.
    
        :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-window-insert-in-new-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of code suggestions in new file in the editor." lightbox="media/vs-2022/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-window-insert-in-new-file.png":::
    
    Visual Studio 2022 version 17.12 now includes [code referencing in GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/). This feature in GitHub Copilot notifies you when suggestions match public code. You can view the matching code, its source file, and any associated licensing information directly within Visual Studio. This enables you to make more informed decisions about whether to use the suggested code.

### Ask questions in the inline chat view

The inline chat view of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio enables you to ask your questions and see answers inline with the code in the editor window itself. With inline chat, you don't have to go back and forth to the chat window. It is usually the best way to work with Copilot on questions that add to or update a currently open code file.

1. In Visual Studio, right click in your editor window and select **Ask Copilot** to bring up the inline chat view of Copilot Chat in the editor itself.
