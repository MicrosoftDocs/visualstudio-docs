# How to: Build to a common output directory

By default, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] builds each project in a solution in its own folder inside the solution. You can change the build output paths of your projects to force all outputs to be placed in the same folder.

## To place all solution outputs in a common directory

1. Click on one project in the solution.

2. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.

3. Depending on the type of project, click on either the **Compile** tab or the **Build** tab, and set the **Output path** to a folder to use for all projects in the solution.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all projects in the solution.
