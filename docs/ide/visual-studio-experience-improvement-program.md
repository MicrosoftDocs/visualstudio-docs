# Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program

The Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP) is designed to help Microsoft improve Visual Studio over time. This program [collects information about errors](../ide/diagnostic-data-collection.md), computer hardware, and how people use Visual Studio, without interrupting users in their tasks at the computer. The information that's collected helps Microsoft identify which features to improve. This document covers how to opt in or out of the VSCEIP. When you opt out, you are opting out of **optional** diagnostic data collection. Some diagnostic data collection is **required** to make sure Visual Studio is secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Required diagnostic data collection will not be affected by your choice to opt out of VSCEIP.

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-hybrid-note](../misc/includes/gdpr-hybrid-note.md)]
> [!NOTE]
> VSCEIP telemetry opt in or out settings do not apply to 'Report a Problem' in Visual Studio. When you report a problem logs are collected and sent to Microsoft only when you provide permission by clicking ‘Submit’. If you are interested in managing logs before submitting to 'Report a Problem' please see [Feedback Data Privacy](./developer-community-privacy.md) for more details.

## Opt in or out

The VSCEIP is turned on by default. You can turn it off, or back on again, by following these instructions:

1. In Visual Studio, choose **Help** > **Send Feedback**, and then select **Settings**.

   The **Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program** dialog box opens.

1. To opt out, select **No, I would not like to participate**, and then select **OK**. To opt in, select **Yes, I am willing to participate**, and then select **OK**.

### Registry settings

If you install the [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017), you must update the registry to configure the VSCEIP. Enterprise customers can construct a group policy to opt in or out of the VSCEIP by setting a registry-based policy.

The relevant registry key and settings are as follows:

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

- On a 64-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VSCommon\15.0\SQM**
- On a 32-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VSCommon\15.0\SQM**
- When Group Policy is enabled, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\SQM**

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

- On a 64-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VSCommon\16.0\SQM**
- On a 32-bit OS, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VSCommon\16.0\SQM**
- When Group Policy is enabled, Key = **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\SQM**

::: moniker-end

Entry = **OptIn**

Value = (DWORD)

- **0** is opted out (turn off the VSCEIP)
- **1** is opted in (turn on the VSCEIP)

> [!CAUTION]
> Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued data on the computer. You can also use the **Last Known Good Configuration** startup option if you encounter problems after manual changes have been applied.
