# How to: View inheritance between types in Class Designer

You can find the inheritance relationship, if it exists, between a base type and its derived types on a class diagram in **Class Designer**. To create an inheritance relationship, if none exist, between two types, see [How to: Create inheritance between types](how-to-create-inheritance-between-types.md).

## To find the base type

1. On the class diagram, click the type for which you want to see the base class or interface.

2. On the **Class Diagram** menu, choose **Show Base Class** or **Show Base Interfaces**.

     The type's base class or interface appears selected on the diagram. Any hidden inheritance lines now appear between the two shapes.

You can also right-click the type whose base type you want to display, and choose **Show Base Class** or **Show Base Interfaces**.

## To find the derived types

1. On the class diagram, click the type for which you want to see the derived classes or interfaces.

2. On the **Class Diagram** menu, choose **Show Derived Classes** or **Show Derived Interfaces**.

     The type's derived classes or interfaces appear on the diagram. Any hidden inheritance lines now appear between the shapes.

You can also right-click the type for which you want to see its derived types, and choose **Show Derived Classes** or **Show Derived Interfaces**.
