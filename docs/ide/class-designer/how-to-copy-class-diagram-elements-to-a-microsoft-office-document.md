# How to: Copy class diagram elements to a Microsoft Office document

You can copy shapes from a .NET class diagram (*.cd* file) to other documents. You'll either get a copy of the shape or its underlying code, based on the kind of document where you paste it. To copy shapes from UML class diagrams in a modeling project, see [Export diagrams as images](../../modeling/export-diagrams-as-images.md).

## Copy a single element

Right-click the shape and choose **Copy Image**.

## Copy several elements

1. Select the shapes on the diagram that you want to copy.

2. Right-click your selection and choose **Copy Image**.

## Copy all the elements in a class diagram

1. Right-click the diagram surface and choose **Select All**, or press **Ctrl + A**.

2. On the **Edit** menu, select **Copy Image**.

You can also choose **Copy** instead of **Copy Image**. **Copy** copies the image as a regular bitmap. **Copy Image** copies the image as a vector-based image, which is better for most Office applications.
