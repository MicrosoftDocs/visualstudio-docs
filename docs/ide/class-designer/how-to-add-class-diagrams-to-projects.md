# How to: Add class diagrams to projects

To design, edit, and refactor classes and other types, add a class diagram to your C#, Visual Basic, or C++ project. To visualize different parts of the code in a project, add multiple class diagrams to the project.

You can't create class diagrams from projects that share code across multiple apps. To create UML class diagrams, see [Create UML modeling projects and diagrams](../../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md).

## Install the Class Designer component

If you haven't installed the **Class Designer** component, follow these steps to install it.

1. Open **Visual Studio Installer** from the Windows Start menu, or by selecting **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features** from the menu bar in Visual Studio.

   **Visual Studio Installer** opens.

1. Select the **Individual components** tab, and then scroll down to the **Code tools** category.

1. Select **Class Designer** and then select **Modify**.

   The **Class Designer** component starts installing.

## Add a blank class diagram to a project

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project node and then choose **Add** > **New Item**. Or, press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**A**.

   The **Add New Item** dialog opens.

2. Expand **Common Items** > **General**, and then select **Class Diagram** from the template list. For Visual C++ projects, look in the **Utility** category to find the **Class Diagram** template.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see the **Class Diagram** template, [follow the steps](#install-the-class-designer-component) to install the **Class Designer** component for Visual Studio.

   The class diagram opens in Class Designer and appears as a file that has a *.cd* extension in **Solution Explorer**. You can drag shapes and lines to the diagram from **Toolbox**.

To add multiple class diagrams, repeat the steps in this procedure.

## Add a class diagram based on existing types

In **Solution Explorer**, open a class file's context menu (right-click) and then choose **View Class Diagram**.

-or-

In **Class View**, open the namespace or type context menu and then choose **View Class Diagram**.

> [!TIP]
> If **Class View** is not open, open **Class View** from the **View** menu.

## To display the contents of a complete project in a class diagram

In **Solution Explorer** or Class View, right-click the project and choose **View**, then choose **View Class Diagram**.

An auto-populated class diagram is created.

> [!NOTE]
> Class Designer is not available in .NET Core projects.
