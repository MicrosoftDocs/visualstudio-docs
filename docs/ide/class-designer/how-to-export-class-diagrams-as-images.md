# How to: Export class diagrams as images

To export a class diagram that you created from code in a project, save the diagram as an image. If you want to export UML class diagrams instead, see [Export diagrams as images](../../modeling/export-diagrams-as-images.md).

## Export a diagram

1. Open your class diagram (*.cd*) file.

2. From the **Class Diagram** menu or the diagram surface shortcut menu, choose **Export Diagram as Image**.

3. Select a diagram.

4. Select the format that you want.

5. Choose **Export** to finish exporting.

To automatically update exported images that are linked from other documents, export the diagram again in Visual Studio.
