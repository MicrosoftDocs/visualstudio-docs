# How to: Add comments to class diagrams

You can use comment shapes to annotate class diagrams. A comment shape has one property, **Text**, into which you can type text. Comment shapes exist only on the diagram surface and not in code.

A comment resides on the class diagram view in **Class Designer**. If you open a second class diagram onto the same project, comments you created in the first view are not visible. If you delete a diagram, all the comments it contained are also deleted.

You can resize a comment shape but you cannot change other aspects of its appearance, such as its background color, font, or font size.

## To add a comment

1. Drag a comment from the **Class Designer Toolbox** onto the class diagram.

2. Click in the new comment shape on the diagram and type the text you want.
