# User permissions and Visual Studio

For reasons of security, you should run Visual Studio as a typical user whenever possible.

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure not to compile, launch, or debug any Visual Studio solution that does not come from a trusted person or a trusted location.

You can do nearly everything in the Visual Studio IDE as a typical user. You need administrator permissions to complete the following tasks:

## Run Visual Studio as an administrator

If you need to run Visual Studio as an administrator, here's how.

### Use the Start menu

1. Depending on the version of Windows you're using, perform one of the following steps:

   - In **Windows 10**, open the **Start** menu, and then scroll to Visual Studio.
   - In **Windows 11**, select the Start button, and then in the **Search** box, type **Visual Studio**.

1. Next, right-click either **Visual Studio 2019** or **Visual Studio 2022**, and then select **Run as administrator**.

   When Visual Studio starts, **(Administrator)** appears after the product name in the title bar, and **ADMIN** appears near the top right of the Visual Studio window, in the same area where **INSIDERS** appears if you are using an insiders build of Visual Studio. You can click on this button to view the **About** dialog.

#### Windows 10

1. Open the **Start** menu, scroll to the version of Visual Studio that you're using, and then select **More** > **Open file location**.
