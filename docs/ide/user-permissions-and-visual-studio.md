# User permissions and Visual Studio

For reasons of security, you should run Visual Studio as a typical user whenever possible.

> [!WARNING]
> You should also make sure not to compile, launch, or debug any Visual Studio solution that does not come from a trusted person or a trusted location.

You can do nearly everything in the Visual Studio IDE as a typical user. You need administrator permissions to complete the following tasks:

## Run Visual Studio as an administrator

If you need to run Visual Studio as an administrator, follow these steps to open the IDE:

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are for Windows 10. They are similar for other versions of Windows.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

1. Open the **Start** menu, and scroll to Visual Studio 2017.

1. From the right-click or context menu of **Visual Studio 2017**, select **More** > **Run as administrator**.

   When Visual Studio starts, **(Administrator)** appears after the product name in the title bar.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

1. Open the **Start** menu, and scroll to Visual Studio 2019.

1. From the right-click or context menu of **Visual Studio 2019**, select **More** > **Run as administrator**.

You can also modify the application shortcut to always run with administrative permissions:

1. Open the **Start** menu, scroll to the version of Visual Studio that you're using, and then select **More** > **Open file location**.

1. In **File Explorer**, locate the **Visual Studio** shortcut for the version that you're using. Then, right-click the shortcut and select **Send to** > **Desktop (create shortcut)**.

1. On the **Windows** desktop, right-click the **Visual Studio** shortcut, and then select **Properties**.

1. Select the **Advanced** button, and then select the **Run as administrator** check box.

1. Select **OK**, and then select **OK** again.
