# Retain Topics for Later Use
When you locate a useful topic, you can access it later by copying it and pasting it into a text file, printing it, or saving it as a favorite. For example, you can retain content for later use by opening the shortcut menu for topics and the choosing the **Copy**, **Print**, **Print Preview**, and **Add to Favorites** options.  
  
## Using the Favorites tab  
 On the **Favorites** tab, you can open the shortcut menu for any entry and then rename it, delete it, or organize entries into folders.
