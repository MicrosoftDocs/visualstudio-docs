# Sign in or switch Visual Studio user accounts 

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"

In this article, you learn how to sign in to Visual Studio, add and switch user accounts, update your profile, sign out of your account, and the benefits to signing in. 

To learn how to access multiple user accounts in Visual Studio, see [Access multiple accounts associated with the Visual Studio sign-in account](sign-in-access-multiple-accounts.md). For guidance on how to add your public GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account to your Visual Studio keychain, see [Work with GitHub accounts in Visual Studio](work-with-github-accounts.md). You can get subscription support and search the frequently asked questions about subscriptions, accounts, and billing [on our Subscription support page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/).

## Sign in to your account

You can sign in to your Microsoft or organizational account, or your GitHub account. Sign in with a Microsoft account to sync settings across devices, collaborate in real time, and access Azure services. Sign in with a GitHub account to access GitHub Copilot and GitHub repositories. To add another account, see [Add and switch user accounts](#add-and-switch).

1. Launch Visual Studio. When you open Visual Studio for the first time, you're prompted to sign in and provide some basic registration information.

   ![Sign-in prompt](../ide/media/vs2019_signinpopup.png)
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you choose not to sign in when you first open Visual Studio, it's easy to do so later. Look for the **Sign in** link in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment.

1. Choose a Microsoft account or a work or school account.  If you don't have one, you can [create a Microsoft account for free](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026324/microsoft-account-how-to-create).

1. Choose your preferred color theme and other UI settings to personalize your Visual Studio experience. Visual Studio [remembers these settings and synchronizes](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md) them across all Visual Studio environments you signed in to. You can change the settings later if you open the **Tools** > **Options** menu in Visual Studio.

You can see that you've successfully signed in, in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment. Unless you sign out, you automatically sign in to Visual Studio whenever you start it, and any changes to synchronized settings are automatically applied.

### Sign in from the IDE

 If you choose to not sign in when you first open Visual Studio, you can sign in later from the IDE. 

1. Select the **Sign in** icon in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment.
1. Select a Microsoft account to sign in.
1. Follow the prompts to enter the new account credentials.

## Benefits: why sign in? 

While you can sign in using a GitHub account to seamlessly access GitHub Copilot and other GitHub resources, we recommend you sign in with a Microsoft account, then add a GitHub account as a secondary account.

The following benefits apply when you use a Microsoft account to sign in:

## Add and switch user accounts in Visual Studio

If you have multiple accounts, you can add them all to Visual Studio so that you can access the resources from any account without having to sign in to it separately.

After you add multiple accounts on one machine, that group of accounts roams with you if you sign in to Visual Studio on another machine.  However, your account credentials do not roam therefore you'll be prompted to enter credentials for those other accounts the first time you attempt to use their resources on a new machine.

To authenticate and access Azure resources from Visual Studio, sign in to Visual Studio with an account that has access to Azure resources and select this account for [Azure Service Authentication](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/service-to-service-authentication#authenticating-with-visual-studio) in **Tools** > **Options** > **Azure Service Authentication** > **Account Selection**.

There are several types of accounts you can add: 

- Add a standard Visual Studio account:
