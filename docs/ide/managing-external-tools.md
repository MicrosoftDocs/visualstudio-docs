# Manage external tools

You can call external tools from inside Visual Studio by using the **Tools** menu. A few default tools are available from the **Tools** menu, and you can customize the menu by adding other executables of your own.

## Tools available on the Tools menu

The **Tools** menu contains several built-in commands, such as:

* **Extensions and Updates** to [Manage Visual Studio Extensions](finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions.md)
* **Code Snippets Manager** to [Organize Code Snippets](code-snippets.md)
* **PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator** to launch [Dotfuscator Community Edition (CE)](dotfuscator/index.md) if it is [installed](dotfuscator/install.md)
* **Customize** to [Customize menus and toolbars](how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md)
* **Options** to [Set a variety of different options for the Visual Studio IDE and other tools](reference/options-dialog-box-visual-studio.md)

## Add new tools to the Tools menu

You can add an external tool to appear on the **Tools** menu.

1. Open the **External Tools** dialog box by choosing **Tools** > **External Tools**.

1. Click **Add**, and then fill in the information. For example, the following entry causes **Windows Explorer** to open at the directory of the file you currently have open in Visual Studio:

   * Title: `Open File Location`

   * Command: `explorer.exe`

   * Arguments: `/root, "$(ItemDir)"`

|Item Directory|$(ItemDir)|The directory of the current file (drive + path).|
|Item File Name|$(ItemFilename)|The file name of the current file (file name).|
|Item Extension|$(ItemExt)|The file name extension of the current file.|

|Target Directory|$(TargetDir)|The directory of the item to be built.|
|Target Name|$(TargetName)|The file name of the item to be built.|
|Target Extension|$(TargetExt)|The file name extension of the item to be built.|
|Binary Directory|$(BinDir)|The final location of the binary that is being built (defined as drive + path).|
|Project Directory|$(ProjectDir)|The directory of the current project (drive + path).|

|Solution Directory|$(SolutionDir)|The directory of the current solution (drive + path).|
