# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit support

Visual Studio enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in Visual Studio, see [64-bit applications](/dotnet/framework/64-bit-apps).

## Deploy a 64-bit application

[Deploy prerequisites for 64-bit applications](../deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications.md) lists the redistributables you can use as prerequisites for the installation of a 64-bit application.

## Configure projects as 64-bit applications

[How to: Configure projects to target platforms](../ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-platforms.md) discusses configuring projects to be built as 64-bit applications.

## Debug a 64-bit application

- [Debug 64-bit applications](../debugger/debug-64-bit-applications.md)
