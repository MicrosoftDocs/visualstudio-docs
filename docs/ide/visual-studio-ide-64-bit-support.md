# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit Support
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [64-bit Applications](../Topic/64-bit%20Applications.md).  
  
## Deploying a 64-bit application  
 The following topics discuss deploying 64-bit applications.  
  
-   [Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](../deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications.md)  
  
-   [How to: Create a Windows Installer for a 64-bit Platform](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/232bfc64-f99a-4cc6-9806-ba70bb9a09ff)  
  
## Configuring projects as 64-bit applications
