# Customize the Visual Studio IDE

You can customize Visual Studio IDE settings in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. Many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances. See [Synchronized settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md). This article briefly describes different personalizations and where you can find more information.

## Export and import Visual Studio environment settings 

Visual Studio lets you export and import your personal environment settings (such as themes, keyboard shortcuts, window layouts, templates, and other preferences) into a new installation. This makes it easy to recreate your previous customized environment when setting up a new Visual Studio instance. You can use the wizard, by selecting **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**, to import or export specific categories of setting, or to reset the environment to one of the default collections of settings.

### Export settings

> [!TIP]  
> Each time you close Visual Studio, a backup of your settings is saved automatically as a `.vssettings` file.  
> You can find this file at: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<version>\Settings\`  
> Each version has its own folder. To reuse your settings, copy the file from the version you want and then follow the steps in the [Import settings](#import-settings) section.  

You can manually export your settings from inside Visual Studio using the wizard:  
1. Open the Visual Studio instance that contains the settings you want to export.  
1. Select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**.  
1. In the wizard, select **Export selected environment settings**, then choose **Next**.  
1. Select which settings you want to export, then choose **Next**.  
1. Enter a filename and location for your `.vssettings` file, then select **Finish**.  

### Import settings  

To manually import your settings:  

1. Open the Visual Studio instance you want to import your settings into.  
1. Select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**.  
1. In the wizard, select **Import selected environment settings**, then choose **Next**.  
1. Select **No, just import new settings, overwriting my current settings**, then choose **Next**.  
1. Select **Browse**, then select your saved `.vssettings` file, then choose **Next**.  
1. Select which settings you want to import, then select **Finish**.  

### Reset all settings

You can also use the wizard to reset the environment to one of the default collections of settings.

1. From the menu bar, select **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**.

1. In the **Import and Export Settings Wizard**, select **Reset all settings**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Reset Complete** page, select **Close**.

## General environment options

Many personalization options are exposed through the [Environment Options](../ide/reference/general-environment-options-dialog-box.md) dialog box. There are two ways to access this dialog box:

- On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and if necessary, expand the **Environment** node.

- Press **Ctrl**+**Q**, enter *environment* in the search box, and then select **Environment** > **General** from the results.

> [!TIP]
> When the Options dialog box appears, you can select **F1** for help on the various settings on that page.

## Environment color themes

To change the color theme between Dark, Light, Blue, and Blue (Extra Contrast), enter *theme* in the search box, and then choose **Environment** > **General**. In the **Options** dialog box, change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, enter *environment* in the search box, and then choose **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors**. See [Change fonts, colors, and themes](how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).

You can also use the **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Fonts and Colors** to establish a custom font and color scheme for various user interface elements in the integrated development environment (IDE). See the reference page on [Fonts and Colors, Environment, Options dialog box](./reference/fonts-and-colors-environment-options-dialog-box.md).

## Customize menus and toolbars

To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [Customize menus and toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).

### Main menu casing

You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** ("File") and **All Caps** ("FILE"). Enter *environment* in the search box, select **Environment** > **General**, and then change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.

## Window layouts

You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define one layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior and save custom layouts, see [Customize window layouts and personalize tabs](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).

## External tools

You can customize the **Tools** menu to launch external tools. For more information, see [Manage external tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).
