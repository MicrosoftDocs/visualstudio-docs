# Code generation features in Visual Studio

There are numerous ways that Visual Studio can help you generate, fix, and refactor code.

## Features

- You can use [code snippets](../ide/code-snippets.md) to insert a template such as a [switch](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch) block or an [enum](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum) declaration.

- You can use [Quick Actions](../ide/quick-actions.md) to generate code such as classes and properties, or to introduce a local variable. You can also use Quick Actions to [improve code](../ide/common-quick-actions.md), for example to remove unnecessary casts and unused variables, or to add null checks before accessing variables.

- You can [refactor code](../ide/refactoring-in-visual-studio.md) to rename a variable, re-order method parameters, or synchronize a type with its filename, to name a few.

> [!NOTE]
> Each language service in Visual Studio provides its own code generation capabilities, so some features are only available in C#, and some are available in both C# and Visual Basic.
