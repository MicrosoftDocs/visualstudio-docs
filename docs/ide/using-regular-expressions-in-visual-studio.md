# Use regular expressions in Visual Studio

Visual Studio uses [.NET Framework regular expressions](/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expressions) to find and replace text.

## Replacement patterns

To use a numbered capture group, surround the group with parentheses in the regular expression pattern. Use `$number`, where `number` is an integer starting at 1, to specify a specific, numbered group in a replacement pattern. For example, the grouped regular expression `(\d)([a-z])` defines two groups: the first group contains a single decimal digit, and the second group contains a single character between **a** and **z**. The expression finds four matches in the following string: **1a 2b 3c 4d**. The replacement string `z$1` references the first group only, and converts the string to **z1 z2 z3 z4**.

For information about regular expressions that are used in replacement patterns, see [Substitutions in regular expressions (.NET guide)](/dotnet/standard/base-types/substitutions-in-regular-expressions).

## Regular expression examples

Here are some examples:

|Purpose|Expression|Example|
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
|Match any single character (except a line break)|.|`a.o` matches "aro" in "around" and "abo" in "about" but not "acro" in "across".|
|Match zero or more occurrences of the preceding expression (match as many characters as possible)|*|`a*r` matches "r" in "rack", "ar" in "ark", and "aar" in "aardvark"|
|Match any character zero or more times (Wildcard *)|.*|`c.*e` matches "cke" in "racket", "comme" in "comment", and "code" in "code"|
|Match one or more occurrences of the preceding expression (match as many characters as possible)|+|`e.+d` matches "eed" in "feeder" but not "ed".|
|Match any character one or more times (Wildcard ?)|.+|`e.+e` matches "eede" in "feeder" but not "ee".|
|Match zero or more occurrences of the preceding expression (match as few characters as possible)|*?|`e.*?e` matches "ee" in "feeder" but not "eede".|
|Match one or more occurrences of the preceding expression (match as few characters as possible)|+?|`e.+?e` matches "ente" and "erprise" in "enterprise", but not the whole word "enterprise".|
|Anchor the match string to the beginning of a line|^|`^car` matches the word "car" only when it appears at the beginning of a line.|
|Anchor the match string to the end of a line|$|`end$` matches the word "end" only when it appears at the end of a line.|
|Match any single character in a set|[abc]|`b[abc]` matches "ba", "bb", and "bc".|
|Match any character in a range of characters|[a-f]|`be[n-t]` matches "bet" in "between", "ben" in "beneath", and "bes" in "beside", but not "below".|
|Capture and implicitly number the expression contained within parenthesis|()|`([a-z])X\1` matches "aXa"and "bXb", but not "aXb". "\1" refers to the first expression group "[a-z]".|
|Invalidate a match|(?!abc)|`real(?!ity)` matches "real" in "realty" and "really" but not in "reality." It also finds the second "real" (but not the first "real") in "realityreal".|
|Match any character that is not in a given set of characters|[^abc]|`be[^n-t]` matches "bef" in "before", "beh" in "behind", and "bel" in "below", but not "beneath".|
|Match either the expression before or the one after the symbol.|&#124;|`(sponge\|mud) bath` matches "sponge bath" and "mud bath."|
|Escape the character following the backslash| \\ |`\^` matches the character ^.|
|Specify the number of occurrences of the preceding character or group|{x}, where x is the number of occurrences|`x(ab){2}x` matches "xababx", and `x(ab){2,3}x` matches "xababx" and "xabababx" but not "xababababx".|
|Match text in a Unicode character class, where "X" is the Unicode number. For more information about Unicode character classes, see<br /><br /> [Unicode Standard 5.2 Character Properties](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch04.pdf).|\p{X}|`\p{Lu}` matches "T" and "D" in "Thomas Doe".|
|Match a word boundary|`\b` (Outside a character class \b specifies a word boundary, and inside a character class specifies a backspace).|`\bin` matches "in" in "inside" but not "pinto".|
|Match a line break (that is, a carriage return followed by a new line).|\r?\n|`End\r?\nBegin` matches "End" and "Begin" only when "End" is the last string in a line and "Begin" is the first string in the next line.|
|Match any alphanumeric character|\w|`a\wd` matches "add" and "a1d" but not "a d".|
|Match any whitespace character.|(?([^\r\n])\s)|`Public\sInterface` matches the phrase "Public Interface".|
|Match any numeric character|\d|`\d` matches and "3" in "3456", "2" in 23", and "1" in "1".|
|Match a Unicode character|\uXXXX where XXXX specifies the Unicode character value.|`\u0065` matches the character "e".|
|Match an identifier|\b[\_\w-[0-9]][\_\w]*\b|Matches "type1" but not "&type1" or "#define".|
|Match a string inside quotes|((\\".+?\\")&#124;('.+?'))|Matches any string inside single or double quotes.|
|Match a hexadecimal number|\b0[xX]([0-9a-fA-F]\)\b|Matches "0xc67f" but not "0xc67fc67f".|
|Match integers and decimals|\b[0-9]*\\.\*[0-9]+\b|Matches "1.333".|

> [!TIP]
> In Windows operating systems, most lines end in "\r\n" (a carriage return followed by a new line). These characters aren't visible, but are present in the editor and are passed to the .NET regular expression service.
