# How to: Configure Projects to Target Platforms
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [64-bit Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/fd4026bc-2c3d-4b27-86dc-ec5e96018181).  
  
## Targeting Platforms with the Configuration Manager  
 The **Configuration Manager** provides a way for you to quickly add a new platform to target with your project. If you select one of the platforms included with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the properties for your project are modified to build your project for the selected platform.  
  
#### To configure a project to target a 64-bit platform  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Configuration Manager**.  
  
2.  In the **Active solution platform** list, choose a 64-bit platform for the solution to target, and then choose the **Close** button.  
  
    1.  If the platform that you want doesnâ€™t appear in the **Active solution platform** list, choose **New**.  
  
         The **New Solution Platform** dialog box appears.  
  
    2.  In the **Type or select the new platform** list, choose **x64**.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  If you give your configuration a new name, you may have to modify the settings in the **Project Designer** to target the correct platform.  
  
    3.  If you want to copy the settings from a current platform configuration, choose it, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 The properties for all projects that target the 64-bit platform are updated, and the next build of the project will be optimized for 64-bit platforms.  
  
## Targeting Platforms in the Project Designer  
 The Project Designer also provides a way to target different platforms with your project. If selecting one of the platforms included in the list in the **New Solution Platform** dialog box does not work for your solution, you can create a custom configuration name and modify the settings in the **Project Designer** to target the correct platform.  
  
 Performing this task varies based on the programming language you are using. See the following links for more information:  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects, see [/platform (Visual Basic)](/dotnet/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/platform).  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] projects, see [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](../ide/reference/build-page-project-designer-csharp.md).  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] projects, see [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](/cpp/build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation).
