# How to: Manage build configurations with Visual Basic developer settings applied

By default, all advanced build configuration options are hidden when Visual Basic developer settings are applied. This article explains how to manually enable these build settings.

## Enable advanced build configurations

By default, the Visual Basic developer settings hide the option to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists in the [Project Designer](../ide/reference/application-page-project-designer-visual-basic.md).

1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.

2. Expand **Projects and Solutions**, and click **General**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **General** node is visible even if the **Show all settings** option is unchecked. If you want to see every option available, click **Show all settings**.

3. Click **Show advanced build configurations**.

4. Click **OK**.

     **Configuration Manager** is now available on the **Build** menu, and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists are visible in the **Project Designer**.
