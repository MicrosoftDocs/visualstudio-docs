# How to: Manage Build Configurations with Visual Basic Developer Settings Applied
By default, all advanced build configuration options are hidden with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] Developer settings applied. This topic explains how to manually enable these settings.  
  
## Enabling advanced build configurations  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] Developer settings hide the option to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists in the [Project Designer](..//ide/reference/application-page-project-designer-visual-basic.md).  
  
#### To enable advanced build configurations  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2.  Expand **Projects and Solutions**, and click **General**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **General** node is visible even if the **Show all settings** option is unchecked. If you want to see every option available, click **Show all settings**.  
  
3.  Click **Show advanced build configurations**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
     On the **Build** menu, **Configuration Manager** is now available, and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists are visible in the Project Designer.
