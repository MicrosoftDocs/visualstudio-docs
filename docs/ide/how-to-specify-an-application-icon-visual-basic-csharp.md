# How to: Specify an application icon (Visual Basic, C#)

The `Icon` property for a project specifies the icon file (*.ico*) that will be displayed for the compiled application in **File Explorer** and in the Windows taskbar.

The `Icon` property can be accessed in the **Application** pane of the **Project Designer**; it contains a list of icons that have been added to a project either as resources or as content files.

> [!NOTE]
> After you set the icon property for an application, you might also set the `Icon` property of each **Window** or **Form** in the application. For information about window icons for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) standalone applications, see <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A> property.

## To specify an application icon

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a project node (not the **Solution** node).

1. On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Properties**.

1. When the **Project Designer** appears, choose the **Application** tab.

1. **(Visual Basic)**&mdash;In the **Icon** list, choose an icon (*.ico*) file.

    **C#**&mdash;Near the **Icon** list, choose the **\<Browse...>** button, and then browse to the location of the icon file that you want.
