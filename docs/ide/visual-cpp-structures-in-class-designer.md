# Visual C++ Structures in Class Designer
Class Designer supports C++ structures, which are declared with the keyword `struct`. Following is an example:  
  
```  
struct MyStructure  
{  
   char a;  
   int i;  
   long j;  
};  
```  
  
 For more information about using the `struct` type, see [struct](/cpp/cpp/struct-cpp).  
  
 A C++ structure shape in a class diagram looks and works like a class shape, except that the label reads **Struct** and it has square corners instead of rounded corners.
