# Visual C++ Enumerations in Class Designer
Class Designer supports C++ `enum` and scoped `enum class` types. Following is an example:  
  
```  
enum CardSuit {  
   Diamonds = 1,  
   Hearts = 2,  
   Clubs = 3,  
   Spades = 4  
};  
  
// or...  
enum class CardSuit {  
   Diamonds = 1,  
   Hearts = 2,  
   Clubs = 3,  
   Spades = 4  
};  
  
```  
  
 A C++ enumeration shape in a class diagram looks and works like a structure shape, except that the label reads **Enum** or **Enum class**, it is pink instead of blue, and it has a colored border on the left and top margins. Both enumeration shapes and structure shapes have square corners.  
  
 For more information about using the `enum` type, see [Enumerations](/cpp/cpp/enumerations-cpp).
