# Manage application resources (.NET)

Resource files are files that are part of an application but are not compiled, for example icon files or audio files. Since these files are not part of the compilation process, you can change them without having to recompile your binaries. If you are planning to localize your application, you should use resource files for all the strings and other resources that need to be changed when you localize your application.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Visual Studio on Windows. For Visual Studio for Mac, see [Managing app resources (Visual Studio for Mac)](/visualstudio/mac/managing-app-resources).

For more information about resources in .NET apps, see [Resources in .NET apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index).

## Work with resources

In a managed code project, open the project properties window. You can open the properties window by either:

- Right-clicking the project node in **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Properties**
- Typing **project properties** in the **Ctrl**+**Q** search box
- Pressing **Alt**+**Enter** in **Solution Explorer**

Select the **Resources** tab. You can add a *.resx* file if your project does not contain one already, add and delete different kinds of resources, and modify existing resources.

## Resources in other project types

Resources are managed differently in .NET projects than in other project types. For more information about resources in:

- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, see [App resources and the Resource Management System](/windows/uwp/app-resources/)
- C++ projects, see [Work with resource files](/cpp/windows/working-with-resource-files) and [How to: Create a resource](/cpp/windows/how-to-create-a-resource)
