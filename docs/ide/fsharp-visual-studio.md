# Develop with Visual F# in Visual Studio

This article includes information about Visual Studio features for F# development.

## Install F# support

To develop with F# in Visual Studio, first install the **.NET desktop development** workload if you haven't already. You install Visual Studio workloads through Visual Studio Installer, which you can open by selecting **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**.

## F# project features

Various project and item templates are available for F# in Visual Studio. The following image shows some of the F# project templates for .NET Core and .NET Standard:

For more information about the item templates for data access, see [F# type providers](/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/index).

The following table summarizes features in project properties for F#:

## Project Designer

**Project Designer** consists of several project property pages grouped by related functionality. The pages available for F# projects are mostly a subset of those available for other languages, and are described in the following table. Links are provided to the corresponding C# **Project Designer** page.

|Project Designer page|Related links|Description|
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
|Application|[Application Page, Project Designer](reference/application-page-project-designer-csharp.md)|Enables you to specify application-level settings and properties, such as whether you are creating a library or an executable file, what version of the .NET Framework the application is targeting, and information about where the resource files that the application uses are stored.|

|Debug|[Debug Page, Project Designer](reference/debug-page-project-designer.md)|Enables you to control how the application runs during debugging. This includes what commands to use and what your application's starting directory is, and any special debugging modes you want to enable, such as native code and SQL.|
|Package (.NET SDK only)|N/A|Enables you to define NuGet Package metadata when publishing as a NuGet package.|

The following table summarizes settings that are specific to F#:

|Project Designer page|Setting|Description|
|---------------------|-------|-----------|
|Build|Generate tail calls|If selected, enables the use of the tail Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) instruction. This causes the stack frame to be reused for tail recursive functions. Equivalent to the `--tailcalls` compiler option.|

|Go to Definition from QuickInfo|Clickable symbols inside tooltips that invoke Go to Definition.|Yes|
|Go to All|Enables global, fuzzy-matching navigation for all F# constructs via **ctrl+T**.|Yes|
