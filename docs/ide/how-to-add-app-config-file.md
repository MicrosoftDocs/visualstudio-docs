# How to: Add an application configuration file to a C# project

By adding an application configuration file (*app.config* file) to a C# project, you can customize how the common language runtime locates and loads assembly files. For more information about application configuration files, see [How the runtime locates assemblies (.NET Framework)](/dotnet/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies).

> [!NOTE]
> UWP apps don't contain an *app.config* file.

When you build your project, the development environment automatically copies your *app.config* file, changes the file name of the copy to match your executable, and then moves the copy to the **bin** directory.

## To add an application configuration file to a C# project

1. On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

     The **Add New Item** dialog box appears.

1. Expand **Installed** > **Visual C# Items**, and then choose the **Application Configuration File** template.

1. In the **Name** text box, enter a name, and then choose the **Add** button.

     A file named *app.config* is added to your project.
