# Step 6: Add a subtraction problem
In the sixth part of this tutorial, you'll add a subtraction problem and learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Store the subtraction values.

- Generate random numbers for the problem (and be sure that the answer is between 0 and 100).

- Update the method that checks the answers so that it checks the new subtraction problem too.

- Update your timer's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event handler so that the event handler fills in the correct answer when time runs out.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is part of a tutorial series about basic coding concepts. For an overview of the tutorial, see [Tutorial 2: Create a timed math quiz](../ide/tutorial-2-create-a-timed-math-quiz.md).

## To add a subtraction problem

1. Add two integer variables for the subtraction problem to your form, between the integer variables for the addition problem and the timer. The code should look like the following.

     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/vb/form1.vb" id="Snippet12":::
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/cs/form1.cs" id="Snippet12":::

     [!INCLUDE [devlang-control-csharp-vb](./includes/devlang-control-csharp-vb.md)]

     The names of the new integer variables—**minuend** and **subtrahend**—aren't programming terms. They're the traditional names in arithmetic for the number that's being subtracted (the subtrahend) and the number from which the subtrahend is being subtracted (the minuend). The difference is the minuend minus the subtrahend. You could use other names, because your program doesn't require specific names for variables, controls, components, or methods. You must follow rules such as not starting names with digits, but you can generally use names such as x1, x2, x3, and x4. However, generic names make code difficult to read and problems nearly impossible to track down. To keep variable names unique and helpful, you'll use the traditional names for multiplication (multiplicand × multiplier = product) and division (dividend ÷ divisor = quotient) later in this tutorial.

     Next, you'll modify the `StartTheQuiz()` method to provide random values for the subtraction problem.

2. Add the following code after the "Fill in the subtraction problem" comment.

     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/vb/form1.vb" id="Snippet13":::
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/cs/form1.cs" id="Snippet13":::

     To prevent negative answers for the subtraction problem, this code uses the <xref:System.Random.Next> method of the <xref:System.Random> class a little differently from how the addition problem does. When you give the `Next()` method two values, it picks a random number that's greater than or equal to the first value and less than the second one. The following code chooses a random number from 1 through 100 and stores it in the minuend variable.

     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/vb/form1.vb" id="Snippet21":::
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/cs/form1.cs" id="Snippet21":::

     You can call the `Next()` method of the Random class, which you named "randomizer" earlier in this tutorial, in multiple ways. Methods that you can call in more than one way are referred to as overloaded, and you can use IntelliSense to explore them. Look again at the tooltip of the IntelliSense window for the `Next()` method.

     ![IntelliSense window tooltip](../ide/media/express_overloads.png)<br/>
***IntelliSense*** *window tooltip*

     The tooltip shows **(+ 2 overload(s))**, which means that you can call the `Next()` method in two other ways. Overloads contain different numbers or types of arguments, so that they work slightly differently from one another. For example, a method might take a single integer argument, and one of its overloads might take an integer and a string. You choose the correct overload based on what you want it to do. When you add the code to the `StartTheQuiz()` method, more information appears in the IntelliSense window as soon as you enter `randomizer.Next(`. To cycle through the overloads, choose the **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys as shown in the following illustration:

     ![Overload for Next&#40;&#41; method in IntelliSense](../ide/media/express_nextoverload.png)<br/>
*Overload for* ***Next()*** *method in* ***IntelliSense***

     In this case, you want to choose the last overload, because you can specify minimum and maximum values.

3. Modify the `CheckTheAnswer()` method to check for the correct subtraction answer.

     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/vb/form1.vb" id="Snippet14":::
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/cs/form1.cs" id="Snippet14":::

     In C#, `&&` is the `logical and` operator. In Visual Basic, the equivalent operator is `AndAlso`. These operators indicate "If the sum of addend1 and addend2 equals the value of the sum NumericUpDown and if minuend minus subtrahend equals the value of the difference NumericUpDown." The `CheckTheAnswer()` method returns `true` only if the answers to the addition and the subtraction problems are both correct.

4. Replace the last part of the timer's Tick event handler with the following code so that it fills in the correct answer when time runs out.

     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/vb/form1.vb" id="Snippet22":::
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step5_6/cs/form1.cs" id="Snippet22":::

5. Save and run your code.

     Your program includes a subtraction problem, as the following illustration shows:
