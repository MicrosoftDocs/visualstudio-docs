# Connect to projects in Team Explorer

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

Use the **Team Explorer** tool window to coordinate your code efforts with other team members to develop a project, and to manage work that's assigned to you, your team, or your projects. **Team Explorer** connects Visual Studio to Git and GitHub repositories, Team Foundation version control (TFVC) repositories, and projects hosted on [Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops-services) or an on-premises [Azure DevOps Server](/azure/devops/index-all) (formerly known as TFS). You can manage source code, work items, and builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the recent release of Visual Studio 2019 [version 16.8](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/), the new Git version control experience is now on by default. However, if you prefer to continue to use Team Explorer, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features** and then toggle the **New Git user experience** checkbox. For more information, see the [Git experience in Visual Studio](git-with-visual-studio.md) page.
