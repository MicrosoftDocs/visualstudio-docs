# Connect to projects in Team Explorer

Use the **Team Explorer** tool window to coordinate your code efforts with other team members to develop a project, and to manage work that's assigned to you, your team, or your projects. **Team Explorer** connects Visual Studio to Git and GitHub repositories, Team Foundation version control (TFVC) repositories, and projects hosted on [Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops-services) or an on-premises [Azure DevOps Server](/azure/devops/index-all) (formerly known as TFS). You can manage source code, work items, and builds.

> [!TIP]
> If you open Visual Studio and **Team Explorer** doesn't appear, open it by choosing **View** > **Team Explorer** from the menu bar, or by pressing **Ctrl**+**&#92;**, **Ctrl**+**M**.

## Connect to a project or repository

Connect to a project or repository on the **Connect** page.
