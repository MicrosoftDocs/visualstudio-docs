# Install Dotfuscator Community Edition (CE)

Visual Studio 2017 introduces a new low-impact installation experience.
As a result, Dotfuscator Community Edition (Dotfuscator CE) is not installed by default.
However, it is easy to install Dotfuscator CE even if you have already installed Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the versions of Dotfuscator CE shipped with releases of Visual Studio,
> PreEmptive Solutions also periodically provides updated versions on its website.
> If you want to download the **latest version** directly instead of installing from Visual Studio,
> **[click here to go to the Dotfuscator Downloads page][download]**.

## Within Visual Studio

You can install Dotfuscator CE from the Visual Studio IDE:

1. In the **Quick Launch** (Ctrl+Q) search bar, type `dotfuscator`. <br/> <br/> ![](media/install_from_vs_12.png) <br/> <br/>
2. In the Quick Launch results shown, under the *Install* heading, select **PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator (Individual Component)**.
  * If you instead see, under the *Menus* heading, **Tools - PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator**, then Dotfuscator CE is already installed. For usage details, see [the Getting Started page of the full Dotfuscator CE User Guide][get-started].
3. A Visual Studio Installer window will launch, pre-configured with to install Dotfuscator CE.
  * You may be required to provide administrator credentials to continue.
