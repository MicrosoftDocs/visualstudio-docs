# Notifications tool window

The **Notifications** tool window shows messages about Visual Studio, including critical issues with your license and informational notifications of updates to Visual Studio or to packages.

A bell icon at the bottom right of the Visual Studio IDE shows the count of notifications. Click the bell to open the Notifications tool window.

You can also open the **Notifications** tool window by the menu entry **View** > **Us**er Notifications**.

To open the **Notifications** tool window with the keyboard, press the key sequence **Ctrl**+**/**, **Ctrl**+**N**. 

You can also press **Ctrl**+**Q** to bring up **Feature Search**, and type in `Notifications` to find and open the window.

The following image shows a typical user notification, showing that a new preview is available for installation:

If you click on the **View details** link, the Visual Studio installer opens. Close any other instance of the installer before clicking the link. To install later, you can choose the **Update on close** link. Visual Studio will start the update the next time you close the IDE.

Dismiss notifications by pressing the `X` next to the notification, or click on **Dismiss All** to dismiss all notifications.
