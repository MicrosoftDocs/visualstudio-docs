# Manage application settings (.NET)

Application settings enable you to store application information dynamically. Settings allow you to store information on the client computer that should not be included in the application code (for example a connection string), user preferences, and other information you need at runtime.

Application settings replace the dynamic properties used in earlier versions of Visual Studio.

Each application setting must have a unique name. The name can be any combination of letters, numbers, or an underscore that does not start with a number, and it cannot have spaces. The name is changed through the `Name` property.

Application settings can be stored as any data type that is serialized to XML or has a `TypeConverter` that implements `ToString`/`FromString`. The most common types are `String`, `Integer`, and `Boolean`, but you can also store values as <xref:System.Drawing.Color>, <xref:System.Object>, or as a connection string.

Application settings also hold a value. The value is set with the **Value** property and must match the data type of the setting.

In addition, application settings can be bound to a property of a form or control at design time.

There are two types of application settings, based on scope:

- Application-scoped settings can be used for information such as a URL for a web service or a database connection string. These values are associated with the application. Therefore, users cannot change them at run time.

- User-scoped settings can be used for information such as persisting the last position of a form or a font preference. Users can change these values at run time.

You can change the type of a setting by using the **Scope** property.

The project system stores application settings in two XML files:

- an *app.config* file, which is created at design time when you create the first application setting

- a *user.config* file, which is created at run time when the user who runs the application changes the value of any user setting.

Notice that changes in user settings are not written to disk unless the application specifically calls a method to do this.

## Create application settings at design time

At design time, you can create application settings in two ways: by using the **Settings** page of the **Project Designer**, or by using the **Properties** window for a form or control, which allows you to bind a setting to a property.

When you create an application-scoped setting (for example, a database connection string, or a reference to server resources), [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] saves it in *app.config* with the `<applicationSettings>` tag. (Connection strings are saved under the `<connectionStrings>` tag.)

When you create a user-scoped setting (for example, default font, home page, or window size), [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] saves it in *app.config* with the `<userSettings>` tag.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you store connection strings in *app.config*, you should take precautions to avoid revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or server paths, in the connection string.
>
> If you take connection string information from an external source, such as a user supplying a user ID and password, you must be careful to ensure that the values that you use to construct your connection string do not contain additional connection string parameters that change the behavior of your connection.
>
> Consider using the Protected Configuration feature to encrypt sensitive information in the configuration file. For more information, see [Protect connection information](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information).

> [!NOTE]
> Because there is no configuration file model for class libraries, application settings do not apply for Class Library projects. The exception is a Visual Studio Tools for Office DLL project, which can have a configuration file.

## Use customized settings files

You can add customized settings files to your project for convenient management of groups of settings. Settings that are contained in a single file are loaded and saved as a unit. Storing settings in separate files for frequently used and infrequently used groups can save time in loading and saving settings.

For example, you can add a file such as *SpecialSettings.settings* to your project. While your `SpecialSettings` class is not exposed in the `My` namespace, **View Code** can read the custom settings file that contains `Partial Class SpecialSettings`.

The **Settings Designer** first searches for the *Settings.settings* file that the project system creates; this file is the default file that the **Project Designer** displays in the **Settings** tab. *Settings.settings* is located in the *My Project* folder for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects and in the *Properties* folder for [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] projects. The **Project Designer** then searches for other settings files in the project's root folder. Therefore, you should put your custom settings file there. If you add a *.settings* file elsewhere in your project, the **Project Designer** will not be able to locate it.

## Access or change application settings at run time in Visual Basic

In Visual Basic projects, you can access application settings at run time by using the `My.Settings` object. On the **Settings** page, click the **View code** button to view the *Settings.vb* file. *Settings.vb* defines the `Settings` class, which enables you to handle these events on the settings class: <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.SettingChanging>, <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.PropertyChanged>, <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.SettingsLoaded>, and <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase.SettingsSaving>. Notice that the `Settings` class in *Settings.vb* is a partial class that displays only the user-owned code, not the whole generated class. For more information about accessing application settings by using the `My.Settings` object, see [Access application settings (.NET Framework)](/dotnet/visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/accessing-application-settings).

The values of any user-scoped settings that the user changes at run time (for example, the position of a form) are stored in a *user.config* file. Notice that the default values are still saved in *app.config*.

If any user-scoped settings are changed during run time, for example in testing the application, and want to reset these settings to their default values, click the **Synchronize** button.

We strongly recommend that you use the `My.Settings` object and the default *.settings* file to access settings. This is because you can use the **Settings Designer** to assign properties to settings, and, additionally, user settings are automatically saved before application shutdown. However, your Visual Basic application can access settings directly. In that case you have to access the `MySettings` class and use a custom *.settings* file in the root of the project. You must save the user settings before ending the application, as you would do for a C# application; this is described in the following section.

## Access or change application settings at run time in C#
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD003 -->

In languages other than Visual Basic, such as C#, you must access the `Settings` class directly, as shown in the following [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] example.

```csharp
Properties.Settings.Default.FirstUserSetting = "abc";
```

You must explicitly call the `Save` method of this wrapper class in order to persist the user settings. You usually do this in the `Closing` event handler of the main form. The following C# example shows a call to the `Save` method.

```csharp
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();
```

For general information about accessing application settings through the `Settings` class, see [Application settings overview (.NET Framework)](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview).
