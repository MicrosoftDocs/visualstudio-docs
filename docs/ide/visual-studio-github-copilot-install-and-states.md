# Install GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio

## Manage your Copilot state 

With Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 Preview 3, you see a Copilot status icon in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment that indicates if Copilot is active, inactive, unavailable, or not installed. Using the dropdown menu from the status icon, you can easily access options that help manage or troubleshoot your Copilot state. Some options are available or greyed out depending on your Copilot state.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the status icon is moving from the bottom panel of the Visual Studio editor. 

### Copilot is active

Copilot is in an active state and fully functional if you [signed into Visual Studio with a GitHub account](work-with-github-accounts.md) that has an active [subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot) to [GitHub Copilot for Individuals](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-individuals) or [GitHub Copilot for Business](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business).

Using the dropdown menu, you can easily open the Chat window, access Copilot settings, and manage Copilot subscription.

### Copilot is inactive

If Copilot is installed but in an inactive state, it may be because:
-  you're not yet signed into Visual Studio with a GitHub account
-  your signed in GitHub account doesn't have an active [Copilot subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot)

Select **Add GitHub Account with a Copilot Subscription** in the dropdown from the status icon to open **Account Settings** and [sign in with a GitHub account](work-with-github-accounts.md) that has an active subscription to use Copilot. When you're signed in, the Copilot status icon updates to active.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/visual-studio-github-copilot-install-and-states/copilot-state-inactive.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copilot badge when Copilot is in an inactive state.":::

If Copilot is inactive as the signed in GitHub account credentials need to be refreshed, select [**Refresh your GitHub credentials**](visual-studio-github-copilot-troubleshoot.md#refresh-your-credentials) from the dropdown to refresh your GitHub account and sign in again.

If [Copilot is disabled by your administrator](visual-studio-github-copilot-troubleshoot.md#copilot-is-disabled), contact your IT administrator to learn more.

### Copilot is unavailable

If Copilot is installed but unavailable for use, it may be due to network connectivity issues, server-side technical problems, or an expired service plan. In this state, Copilot doesn't provide its usual services until the external issues are resolved.

Select **Copilot is unreachable** in the dropdown menu to open the **Troubleshooting** page on diagnosing and resolving common network errors with GitHub Copilot. When the issue is resolved and you're signed in with an active subscription, the Copilot status icon updates to [active](#copilot-is-active).

## Copilot not installed

If you chose to opt out of the default recommended install by unchecking the **GitHub Copilot** component in the installer, the status icon is still available in the IDE. 

Select **Install Copilot** from the dropdown to install Copilot.
If you choose to not install Copilot, you can select **Hide Copilot** from the dropdown to hide the Copilot status icon from the IDE.
