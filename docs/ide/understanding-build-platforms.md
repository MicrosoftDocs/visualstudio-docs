# Understand build platforms

You can store different versions of solution and project properties that apply to different target platforms. For example, you can create a Debug configuration that targets an x86 platform and a Debug configuration that targets an x64 platform. You can quickly change the active platform so that you can easily build multiple configurations.

## In this section

[How to: Configure projects to target multiple platforms](../ide/how-to-configure-projects-to-target-multiple-platforms.md)\
Explains how to configure a project to target multiple platforms.
