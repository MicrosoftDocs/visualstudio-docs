# How to: Change text case in the editor

You can use menu commands or keyboard shortcuts to convert the case of selected text to all upper case or to all lower case.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in this article, which are based on the **General** environment settings. To change your environment settings, choose **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**, and then choose **Reset all settings**.

## To change text case

1. Select the text you want to convert.

2. To convert text to all upper case, choose **Edit** > **Advanced** > **Make Uppercase** or press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**U**.

   To convert text to all lower case, choose **Edit** > **Advanced** > **Make Lowercase** or press **Ctrl**+**U**. (If you have the C++ development workload installed, this keybinding may be used by a different command.)

> [!TIP]
> To revert to the previous case formatting before this change, select **Undo** from the **Edit** menu.
