# How to: Manage editor modes

You can display the Visual Studio code editor in various display modes.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in this article depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, for example to **General** or **Visual C++** settings, choose **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings**, and then choose **Reset all settings**.

## Enable full screen mode

You can choose to hide all tool windows and view only document windows by enabling **Full Screen** mode.

- Press **Alt**+**Shift**+**Enter** to enter or exit **Full Screen** mode.

     -- or --

- Issue the command `View.Fullscreen` in the **Command** window.

## Enable virtual space mode

In **Virtual Space** mode, spaces are inserted at the end of each line of code. Select this option to position comments at a consistent point next to your code.

1. Select **Options** from the **Tools** menu.

2. Expand the **Text Editor** folder, and choose **All Languages** to set this option globally, or choose a specific language folder. For example, to turn on line numbers only in Visual Basic, choose the **Basic** > **Text Editor** node.

3. Select **General** options, and under **Settings**, select **Enable Virtual Space**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Virtual Space** is enabled in **Column Selection** mode. When **Virtual Space** mode is not enabled, the insertion point moves from the end of one line directly to the first character of the next.
