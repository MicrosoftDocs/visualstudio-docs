# Supplying XML Code Comments
You can make the comments in source code files available as IntelliSense. When you add the /doc switch to the Visual Basic, C#, or C++ compiler command line, an .xml file is generated that serves as the basis for IntelliSense documentation.  
  
 For more information about documenting code in Visual Basic, see see [How to: Create XML Documentation](/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-create-xml-documentation).  
  
 For more information about documenting code in C#, see [XML Documentation Comments](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/xml-documentation-comments).  
  
 For more information about documenting code in C++, see [Comments](/cpp/cpp/comments-cpp) and [XML Documentation](/cpp/ide/xml-documentation-visual-cpp).
