## Suggest a Feature
We have introduced a brand new experience for suggesting features alongside the current ability to report problems in Visual Studio Developer Community. Until now Visual Studio users have used User Voice forums to propose new feature ideas. 
With the aim of providing a single platform for all customer feedback and improving user engagement with Visual Studio product teams, we are bringing both the functions under one platform., we are bringing both the functions under one platform.
We have migrated an initial set of ideas from the User Voice forums based on the community impact of the feedback and our product roadmap priorities. Please let us know if you were expecting to see a suggestion here that we may have missed. 
The voting system in User Voice operates differently from the votes in Developer Community. To maintain integrity of Developer Community vote counts and avoid skewing the data, we decided to show the User Voice vote counts prominently as a tag for each suggestion. Users will be able to continue to vote on suggestions in Developer Community, those vote counts will show separately.
UserVoice site is now read only and new suggestions can only be added only on Developer Community.
