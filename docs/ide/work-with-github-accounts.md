# Add your GitHub accounts to your Visual Studio keychain

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"

In this article, you learn how to add your public GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account to your Visual Studio keychain. After you add your account, you can [track your code changes in GitHub repositories](../version-control/git-create-repository.md), right from Visual Studio. You can also create and use [GitHub Actions for deployment automation](../azure/azure-deployment-using-github-actions.md).

## Adding public GitHub accounts

You can add your public GitHub account at any point, after you've [signed into Visual Studio with a Microsoft account, work account, or school account](signing-in-to-visual-studio.md#sign-in-to-your-account).

::: moniker range="vs-2022"

In this article, you learn how to add your public GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account to your Visual Studio keychain. After you add your account, you can use [GitHub Copilot](visual-studio-github-copilot-install-and-states.md) and [track your code changes in GitHub repositories](../version-control/git-create-repository.md), right from Visual Studio. You can also create and use [GitHub Actions for deployment automation](../azure/azure-deployment-using-github-actions.md).

## Adding public GitHub accounts

You can add your public GitHub account at first launch or later, without needing to [sign into Visual Studio with a Microsoft account, work account, or school account](signing-in-to-visual-studio.md#sign-in-to-your-account). You can add multiple GitHub accounts to the IDE. The first account added becomes the **active** account, but you can switch the active account to another one at any time. Adding multiple GitHub accounts impacts Copilot, and version control scenarios,  as well as general GitHub authentication experiences across Visual Studio.

If you have [GitHub Copilot installed](visual-studio-github-copilot-install-and-states.md), you can add a GitHub account with a Copilot subscription by selecting **Sign in to use Copilot** from the [GitHub Copilot status icon](visual-studio-github-copilot-install-and-states.md#copilot-is-inactive) or [**Sign up for Copilot Free**](copilot-free-plan.md) from the chat window, even if you haven't [signed into Visual Studio with a Microsoft account, work account, or school account](signing-in-to-visual-studio.md#sign-in-to-your-account).

### Add a GitHub account at first launch

With Visual Studio 17.13, you can now sign in with a GitHub account when you [launch Visual Studio for the first time](signing-in-to-visual-studio.md#sign-in).

:::image type="content" source="../ide/media/vs-2022/visual-studio-sign-in-pop-up-first-launch.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sign in at Visual Studio first launch.":::

If you choose to not sign in with GitHub at first launch, you can add your GitHub account later using the **profile card** or the **Account Settings** dialog as follows.

### Add a GitHub account from the **profile card**

Select the **Sign in** link in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment and sign in with a [Microsoft account, work account, or school account](signing-in-to-visual-studio.md) or a GitHub account.

:::image type="content" source="../ide/media/vs-2022/signin-profile-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing profile card in Visual Studio.":::

Then, follow these instructions to add your GitHub account.

1. Select the icon with your profile name in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio environment, select **GitHub** if you haven't already signed in or **Add another account**, and then select **GitHub**.

1. You'll be redirected to the browser, where you can sign in with your GitHub credentials. After you sign in, you'll get a success window in the browser, and you can return to Visual Studio.

1. The GitHub account you added will now be present in your profile card. Note that the account you signed in with first is the **Active** account.

## Troubleshooting sign in issues

If you're experiencing issues when adding or re-authenticating GitHub accounts, try the following steps:

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) issues
Verify that HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is not enabled for `localhost` on your system's default web browser:
- On Microsoft Edge, you can type: edge://net-internals/#hsts and enter `localhost` under the **Delete domain security policies** section.
- On Google Chrome, type: chrome://net-internals/#hsts and enter `localhost` under the **Delete domain security policies** section.

### Run-as issues
Running Visual Studio using an account that doesn't match your signed-in Windows account, may cause issues when adding GitHub accounts to Visual Studio. You may encounter this issue when using 3rd party products that attempt to run Visual Studio elevated.

You can verify the user by following these steps:
1. Open the `Task Manager`
2. Navigate to the `Details` tab
3. Search for the `devenv.exe` process
4. Ensure the username for that process matches the signed in Windows Account
   
To fix this, run Visual Studio as the user you're signed into Windows with, and then add your GitHub account. 

> [!NOTE]
> Please [report a problem](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report?space=8&entry=problem) if you're still experiencing sign in issues.
