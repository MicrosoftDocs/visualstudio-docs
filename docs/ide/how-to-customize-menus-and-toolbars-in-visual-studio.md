# How to: Customize menus and toolbars in Visual Studio

You can customize Visual Studio not only by adding and removing toolbars and menus on the menu bar, but also by adding and removing commands on any given toolbar or menu.

> [!WARNING]
> After you customize a toolbar or menu, make sure that its check box remains selected in the **Customize** dialog box. Otherwise, your changes won't persist after you close and reopen Visual Studio.

## Add, remove, or move a menu on the menu bar

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Customize**.

     The **Customize** dialog box opens.

2. On the **Commands** tab, leave the **Menu bar** option button selected, leave **Menu Bar** selected in the list next to that option, and then perform one of the following sets of steps:

    - To add a menu, choose the **Add New Menu** button, choose the **Modify Selection** button, and then name the menu that you want to add.

        ![Customize dialog box showing how to add a menu](../ide/media/addmenu.png)

    - To remove a menu, choose it in the **Controls** list, and then choose the **Delete** button.

    - To move a menu within the menu bar, choose the menu in the **Controls** list, and then choose the **Move Up** or **Move Down** button.

## Add, remove, or move a toolbar

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Customize**.

     The **Customize** dialog box opens.

2. On the **Toolbar** tab, perform one of the following sets of steps:

    - To add a toolbar, choose the **New** button, specify a name for the toolbar that you want to add, and then choose the **OK** button.

        ![Customize dialog box showing how to add a toolbar](../ide/media/addtoolbar.png)

    - To remove a custom toolbar, choose it in the **Toolbars** list, and then choose the **Delete** button.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > You can delete toolbars that you create but not default toolbars.

    - To move a toolbar to a different docking location, choose it in the **Toolbars** list, choose the **Modify Selection** button, and then choose a location in the list that appears.

        You can also drag a toolbar by its left edge to move it anywhere in the main docking area.

        > [!NOTE]
        > For more information about how to improve the usability and accessibility of toolbars, see [How to: Set IDE accessibility options](../ide/reference/how-to-set-ide-accessibility-options.md).
