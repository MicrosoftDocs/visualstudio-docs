# Visual C++ Code Snippets
In Visual Studio, you can use code snippets to add commonly-used code to your C++ code files. In general, you can use code snippets in much the same way as in C#, but the set of default code snippets is different.  
  
 You can either add a code snippet at a particular location in your code (insertion) or surround some selected code with a code snippet.  
  
## Inserting a Code Snippet  
 To insert a code snippet, open a C++ code file (.cpp or .h), click somewhere inside the file, and do one of the following:  
  
-   Right-click to get the context menu and select **Insert Snippet**  
  
-   In the **Edit / IntelliSense** menu, select **Insert Snippet**  
  
-   Use the hotkeys: **CTRL + K + X**  
  
 You should see a list of choices beginning with **#if**. When you select **#if**, you should see the following code added to the file:  
  
```cpp  
#if 0  
  
#endif // 0  
```  
  
 You can then replace the 0 with the correct condition.  
  
## Using a Code Snippet to Surround Selected Code  
 To use a code snippet to surround selected code, select a line (or multiple lines) and do one of the following:  
  
1.  Right-click to get the context menu and select **Surround With**  
  
2.  In the **Edit / IntelliSense** menu, select **Surround With**  
  
3.  Use the hotkeys: **CTRL + K + S**  
  
 Select **#if**. You should see something like this:  
  
```cpp  
#if 0  
#include "pch.h"  // or whatever line you had selected  
#endif // 0  
```  
  
 You can then replace the 0 with the correct condition.  
  
## Where can I find a complete list of the C++ code snippets?  
 You can find the complete list of C++ code snippets by going to the **Code Snippets Manager** (on the **Tools** menu) and setting the **Language** to **Visual C++**. In the window below, expand **Visual C++**. You should see the names of all the C++ code snippets in alphabetical order.  
  
 The names of most code snippets are self-explanatory, but some names might be confusing.  
  
## Class vs. classi  
 The **class** snippet provides the definition of a class named MyClass, with the appropriate default constructor and destructor, where the definitions of the constructor and destructor are located outside the class:  
  
```cpp  
class MyClass  
{  
public:  
MyClass();  
~MyClass();  
  
private:  
  
};  
  
MyClass::MyClass()  
{  
}  
  
MyClass::~MyClass()  
{  
}  
```  
  
 The classi code snippet also provides the definition of a class named MyClass, but the default constructor and destructor are defined inside the class definition:  
  
```cpp  
class MyClass  
{  
public:  
MyClass()  
{  
}  
  
~MyClass()  
{  
}  
  
private:  
  
};  
```  
  
## For vs. foreach vs. forr vs rfor  
 There are four different for snippets that provide different kinds of for loops.  
  
 The **for** snippet provides a `for` loop in which the condition is based on the length (in `size_t`) of an object:  
  
```cpp  
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++)  
{  
  
}  
```  
  
 The **foreach** snippet provides a `for each` loop that iterates over the members of a collection:  
  
```cpp  
for each (object var in collection_to_loop)  
{  
  
}  
```  
  
 The **forr** snippet provides a reverse `for` loop in which the condition is based on the length (in integers) of an object:  
  
```cpp  
for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--)  
{  
  
}  
```  
  
 The **rfor** snippet provides a [range-based](/cpp/cpp/range-based-for-statement-cpp) for loop (link):  
  
```cpp  
for (auto& i : v)  
{  
  
}  
```  
  
## The destructor snippet (~)  
 The destructor snippet (**~**) shows different behavior in different contexts. If you insert this snippet inside a class, it provides a destructor for that class. For example, given the following code:  
  
```cpp  
class SomeClass {  
  
};  
```  
  
 If you insert the destructor snippet, it provides a destructor for SomeClass:  
  
```cpp  
class SomeClass {  
    ~SomeClass()  
    {  
  
    }  
};  
```  
  
 If you try to insert the destructor snippet outside a class, it provides a destructor with a placeholder name:  
  
```cpp  
~TypeNamePlaceholder()  
{  
  
```
