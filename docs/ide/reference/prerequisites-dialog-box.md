# Prerequisites Dialog Box
This dialog box specifies which prerequisite components are installed, how they are installed, and which order the packages are installed.  
  
 To access this dialog box, select a project node in **Solution Explorer**, and then, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. When the **Project Designer** appears, click the **Publish** tab. On the **Publish** page, click **Prerequisites**. For Setup projects, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. When the **Property Pages** dialog box appears, click **Prerequisites**.  
  
## UIElement List  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Create setup program to install prerequisite components**|Includes the prerequisite components in your application's Setup program (Setup.exe) so that they will be installed before your application, in order of dependency. By default, this option is selected. If it is not selected, no Setup.exe is created.|  
|**Choose which prerequisites to install**|Specifies whether to install components such as [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], Crystal Reports, and so on.<br /><br /> For example, by selecting the check box next to **SQL Server 2005 Express Edition SP2**, you specify that the Setup program verify whether this component is installed on the target computer and install it if it is not already installed.<br /><br /> For detailed information about each prerequisite package, see the Prerequisites Information table later in this topic.|  
|**Check Microsoft Update for more redistributable components**|Clicking this link takes you to the [Bootstrapper Packages to Redistribute Components](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=208835) website to check for updates.|  
|**Download prerequisites from the component vendor's web site**|Specifies that the prerequisite components be installed from the vendor's Web site. This is the default option.|  
|**Download prerequisites from the same location as my application**|Specifies that the prerequisite components be installed from the same location as the application. This copies all the prerequisite packages to the publish location. For this option to work, the prerequisite packages must be on the development computer.|  
|**Download prerequisites from the following location**|Specifies that the prerequisite components be installed from the location that you select. You can use the **Browse** button to select a location.|  
  
## Prerequisites Information  
 The prerequisite components that appear in the **Prerequisites** dialog box might differ from those in the following list. The prerequisite packages listed in the **Prerequisites Dialog Box** are set automatically the first time that you open the dialog box. If you subsequently change the project's target framework, you will have to select the prerequisites manually to match the new target framework.
