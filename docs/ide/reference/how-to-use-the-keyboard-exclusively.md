# How to: Use the keyboard exclusively

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about recent accessibility updates, see the [Accessibility improvements in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/accessibility-improvements-in-visual-studio-2017-version-15-3/) blog post.

[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides many default shortcut key combinations to make it easy to navigate and code within the integrated development environment (IDE). For a full listing of shortcut keys used in Visual Studio, see [Default keyboard shortcuts](../../ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio.md). For information on keyboard shortcuts available for other Microsoft products, see [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/keyboard.aspx](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=40400).

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## Toolbox controls

You can add a control on the Toolbox to a form or designer using the keyboard.

   The control is added to the form or designer.

 You can move among the options in a dialog and change option settings using the keyboard.

### To set dialog box options from the keyboard

    -   For drop-down lists, use **Alt** + **DOWNARROW** to display items and then use **UPARROW** and **DOWNARROW** to change the selected item.

    -   For buttons, press **Enter** to invoke.

    -   For grids, use the Arrow keys to navigate. For drop-down lists in grids, use **Shift** + **Alt** + **DOWNARROW** to display items and then use **UPARROW** and **DOWNARROW** to change the selected item.

## Window and file navigation

 The IDE provides several ways for you to move among open tool and document windows using the keyboard. You can also move and dock tool windows in different locations using the keyboard.

### To navigate among windows and files in the IDE from the keyboard

-   To move among files in an editor or designer, choose CTRL + TAB keys to display the IDE Navigator with **Active Files** selected. Choose the Enter key to navigate to the highlighted file.

2.  On the **Window** menu, select the  **Dockable** option.

3.  Press **ALT** + **Space** and then choose **Move**.

     The docking guide diamond appears.

4.  Use the **ARROW** keys to move the window to a new location.

     The mouse pointer moves with the window as you use the **ARROW** keys.

5.  When you have reached the new location, use the **ARROW** keys to move the mouse pointer over the correct portion of the guide diamond.

     An outline of the tool window appears in the new docking location.

6.  Press **ENTER**.

     The tool window snaps into place at the new docking location.
