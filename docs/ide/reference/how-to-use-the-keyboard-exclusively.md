# Use the keyboard exclusively

Keyboard shortcuts can make it easier to navigate the Visual Studio IDE and to write code. This article explores a few ways you can use keyboard shortcuts more effectively.

For a full listing of command shortcut keys in Visual Studio, see [Default keyboard shortcuts](../../ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your settings or the edition of Visual Studio you use, the dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help. To change your settings, select **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide.md#reset-all-settings).

## Toolbox controls

To add a control on the Toolbox to a form or designer without using the mouse:

1. On the menu bar, select **View** > **Toolbox**.

2. Use the **Ctrl**+**Up arrow** or **Ctrl**+**Down arrow** keys to move among the sections in the **Toolbox** tab.

3. Use the **Up arrow** key or **Down arrow** key to move among the controls in a section.

4. After you select the control, use the **Enter** key to add the control to the form or designer.

## Dialog box options

To move among the options in a dialog box and change option settings by using only the keyboard:

1. Use **Tab** or **Shift**+**Tab** to move up and down through the controls in the dialog box.

2. To change option settings:

   - For radio buttons, use the **Up arrow** and **Down arrow** keys to change the selection.

   - For check boxes, press **Spacebar** to select or unselect.

   - For drop-down lists, use **Alt**+**Down arrow** to display items, and then use the **Up arrow** and **Down arrow** keys to change the selected item.

   - For buttons, select **Enter** to invoke.

   - For grids, use the arrow keys to navigate. For drop-down lists in grids, use **Shift**+**Alt**+**Down arrow** to display items, and then use the **Up arrow** and **Down arrow** keys to change the selected item.

## Navigate between windows and files

- To move among files in an editor or designer, use the **Ctrl**+**Tab** keyboard shortcut to display the IDE Navigator with **Active Files** selected. Choose the **Enter** key to navigate to the highlighted file.

- To move among docked tool windows, use the **Alt**+**F7** keyboard shortcut to display the IDE Navigator with **Active Tool Windows** selected. Choose the **Enter** key to navigate to the highlighted window.

## Move and dock tool windows

1. Navigate to the tool window you intend to move and give it focus.

2. On the **Window** menu, select the **Dockable** option.

3. Press **Alt**+**Spacebar**, and then select **Move**.

   The docking guide diamond appears.

4. Use the arrow keys to move the window to a new location.

   The mouse pointer moves with the window as you use the arrow keys.

5. When you've reached the new location, use the arrow keys to move the mouse pointer over the correct portion of the guide diamond.

   An outline of the tool window appears in the new docking location.

6. Press **Enter**.

   The tool window snaps into place at the new docking location.
