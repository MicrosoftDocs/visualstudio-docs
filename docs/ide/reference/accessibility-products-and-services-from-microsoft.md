##  <a name="windows"></a> Accessibility Features of Windows  
 The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features are installed during Setup. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8431).  
  
### Free Step-by-Step Tutorials  
 Microsoft offers a series of step-by-step tutorials that provide detailed procedures for adjusting the accessibility options and settings on your computer. This information is presented in a side-by-side format so that you can learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both.
