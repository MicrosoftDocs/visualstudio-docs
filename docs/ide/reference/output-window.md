# Output Window
The **Output** window can display status messages for various features in the integrated development environment (IDE). To open the **Output** window, on the menu bar, choose **View/Output** (or click CTRL + ALT + O).  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  The Output window does not appear on the View menu in Visual Studio Express editions. To bring it up, use the hotkey CTRL + ALT + O.  
  
## Toolbar  
 **Show output from**  
 Displays one or more output panes to view. Several panes of information might be available, depending on which tools in the IDE have used the **Output** window to deliver messages to the user.  
  
 **Find Message in Code**  
 Moves the insertion point in the code editor to the line that contains the selected build error.  
  
 **Go to Previous Message**  
 Changes the focus in the **Output** window to the previous build error and moves the insertion point in the code editor to the line that contains that build error.  
  
 **Go to Next Message**  
 Changes the focus in the **Output** window to the next build error and moves the insertion point in the code editor to the line that contains that build error.  
  
 **Clear all**  
 Clears all text from the **Output** pane.  
  
 **Toggle Word Wrap**  
 Turns the Word Wrap feature on and off in the **Output** pane. When Word Wrap is on, text in longer entries that extends beyond the viewing area is displayed on the following line.  
  
## Output Pane  
 The **Output** pane selected in the **Show output from** list displays output from the source indicated.  
  
## Routing Messages to the Output Window  
 To display the **Output** window whenever you build a project, in the **General, Projects and Solutions, Options** dialog box, select **Show Output window when build starts**. Then, with a code file open for editing, choose the **Go to Next Message** and **Go To Previous Message** buttons on the **Output** window toolbar to select entries in the **Output** pane. As you do this, the insertion point in the code editor jumps to the line of code where the selected problem occurs.  
  
 Certain IDE features and commands invoked in the [Command Window](../../ide/reference/command-window.md) deliver their output to the **Output** window. Output from external tools such as .bat and .com files, which is typically displayed in the Command Prompt window, is routed to an **Output** pane when you select the **Use Output Window** option in the [Managing External Tools](../../ide/managing-external-tools.md). Many other kinds of messages can be displayed in **Output** panes as well. For example, when Transact-SQL syntax in a stored procedure is checked against a target database, the results are displayed in the **Output** window.  
  
 You can also program your own applications to write diagnostic messages at run time to an **Output** pane. To do this, use members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug> class or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace> class in the <xref:System.Diagnostics> namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library. Members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug> class display output when you build Debug configurations of your solution or project; members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace> class display output when you build either Debug or Release configurations. For more information, see [Diagnostic Messages in the Output Window](../../debugger/diagnostic-messages-in-the-output-window.md).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)], you can create custom build steps and build events whose warnings and errors are displayed and counted in the **Output** pane. By pressing F1 on a line of output, you can display an appropriate help topic. For more information, see [Formatting the Output of a Custom Build Step or Build Event](/cpp/ide/formatting-the-output-of-a-custom-build-step-or-build-event).  
  
## Scrolling Behavior  
 If you use autoscrolling in the Output window and then navigate by using the mouse or arrow keys, autoscrolling stops. To resume autoscrolling, press CTRL+END.
