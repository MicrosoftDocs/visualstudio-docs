# What is the Project Designer?

The Project Designer in Visual Studio is a dialog box that you can use to specify applications settings and properties for a project. The Project Designer includes several different project properties pages to interact with. What you see depends on your project type, platform, or programming language.

The following screenshot shows the project properties pages in the Project Designer that you'll see after you select **Properties** from the right-click context menu in **Solution Explorer**:

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project properties that you can access by using the Project Designer differ from the properties you can access by using the [Properties window](properties-window.md) in Solution Explorer.
