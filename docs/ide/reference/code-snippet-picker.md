# Code Snippet Picker

The Visual Studio Code Editor provides a **Code Snippet Picker** that allows you, in a few mouse clicks, to insert ready-made blocks of code into the active document.

The procedure to display the **Code Snippet Picker** varies according to the language you are using.

- Visual Basic - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and select **Insert Snippet**.

- C# - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.

- C++ - The **Code Snippet Picker** is not available.

- F# - The **Code Snippet Picker** is not available.

- JavaScript - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.

- XML - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.

- HTML - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet** or **Surround With**.

- SQL - Right-click at the desired location in the Code Editor to display the Shortcut menu, and click **Insert Snippet**.

In most Visual Studio development languages, you can use the **Code Snippets Manager** to add folders to the folder list that the **Code Snippet Picker** scans for XML snippet files. You can also create your own snippets to add to the list. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a code snippet](../../ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet.md).

## UIElement List

Item Name

An editable text field that displays the name of the item selected in the **Item List**. To perform an incremental search for the item you want, begin typing its name in this field. Continue adding letters until the desired item is selected in the **Item List**.

Item List

A list of code snippets available for insertion, or a list of folders containing code snippets. To insert a snippet or expand a folder, select the item you want and press Enter.
