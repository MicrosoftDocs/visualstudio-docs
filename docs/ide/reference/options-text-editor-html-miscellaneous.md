# Options, Text Editor, HTML (Web Forms), Miscellaneous

Use the **Miscellaneous** options page to set preferences for how the HTML editor handles elements pasted into the page. To access this page, on the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and then expand **Text Editor** > **HTML (Web Forms)** > **Miscellaneous**.

## Miscellaneous HTML options

- **Format HTML on paste**

   When this check box is selected, the editor reformats elements pasted into the page, using currently defined formatting rules. If this check box isn't selected, the editor pastes the elements, using the exact formatting of the original element.

- **Require '<' to trigger tag completion window**

   When this check box is selected, the tag completion window appears when you type the less-than character ("<").
