# Options, Text Editor, U-SQL, IntelliSense

Use the **IntelliSense** options page to modify some text editor settings for U-SQL. To access this options page, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and then choose **Text Editor** > **U-SQL** > **IntelliSense**.

## IntelliSense Settings

Select a check box to enable **Quick Info** or **Intellisense**. Quick Info displays the complete declaration when you hover the mouse cursor over a variable.

## Completion Lists

- **Show completion list after a character is typed**

   When this option is selected, IntelliSense automatically displays the completion list when you begin typing. If you don't select this option, IntelliSense completion is still available from the IntelliSense menu or by pressing **Ctrl** + **Spacebar**.

- **Place keywords in completion lists**

   When this option is selected, IntelliSense includes keywords in the completion list.

- **Place code snippets in completion lists**

   When this option is selected, IntelliSense includes code snippets in the completion list.

## Selection in Completion List

- **Commit by typing the following characters**

   This field shows the characters that cause the currently highlighted completion list suggestion to be committed. You can add or remove characters from this list.

- **Commit by pressing the Spacebar**

   When this option is selected, you can commit the highlighted completion list suggestion by pressing the spacebar.

- **Add a new line at the end of fully typed word on Enter**

   When selected, a new line is added automatically and the cursor moves to the new line when you type all the characters for a completion list suggestion.
