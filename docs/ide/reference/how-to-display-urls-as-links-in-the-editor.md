# How to: Display URLs as Links in the Editor

You can choose to have the Code Editor treat Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) in your code as active links. When you use this feature, URLs:

-   Appear underlined.

-   Display a **ToolTip** when you hover over them.

-   Attempt to open the website indicated when you **Ctrl**+**click** on the link. By default, the website is displayed in the internal web browser.

## Display URLs as links

1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.

2.  Click **Text Editor**.

3.  To change the option for only one language, expand the folder for that language and choose **General**.

     —or—

     To change the option for all languages, expand the **All Languages** folder and choose **General**.

4.  Under **Display**, select **Enable single-click URL navigation**.
