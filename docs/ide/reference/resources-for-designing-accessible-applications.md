# Resources for designing accessible applications

Learn more about technologies that support accessible design. We've also included tips and links to tutorials that can help you develop accessible Windows apps and websites.

>[!NOTE]
>For more information about how we develop products that empower everyone, see [Microsoft Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility/).

## Technologies

* **Microsoft Active Accessibility** A COM-based technology that improves the way accessibility aids work with applications running on Microsoft Windows. It provides dynamic-link libraries that are incorporated into the operating system and a COM interface. It also has application programming elements that provide methods for exposing information about user interface elements. For more information, see [Microsoft active accessibility](/windows/desktop/WinAuto/microsoft-active-accessibility).

* **Microsoft .NET Speech Technologies** The Microsoft .NET Speech SDK provides a set of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] controls, a Microsoft Internet Explorer Speech add-in, sample applications, and documentation. Web developers can use these tools to create, debug, and deploy speech-enabled [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] applications. The tools are integrated seamlessly into Microsoft Visual Studio, allowing developers to work in the familiar development environment. For more information, see [Speech server](/previous-versions/office/developer/speech-technologies/ms950383\(v\=msdn.10\)).

* **Understanding SAMI 1.0** Microsoft Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI) technology provides a way for developers to caption audio content for PC multimedia. For more information, see [Understanding SAMI 1.0](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/understanding-sami-1.0).

## Windows applications

* **[Walkthrough: Creating an accessible Windows-based application](/dotnet/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-an-accessible-windows-based-application)** This article provides step-by-step instructions for including the five accessibility requirements for the "Certified for Windows" logo in a sample Windows application.

* **Guidelines for keyboard user interface design** This technical article describes how to design a Windows application that users can navigate from the keyboard. For more information, see [Guidelines for keyboard user interface design](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/guidelines-for-keyboard-user-interface-design).

* **Console accessibility** This technical article describes the APIs and events used to expose the console in Windows XP for accessibility aids. For more information, see [Console accessibility](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/console-accessibility).

## Websites

- [Walkthrough: Accessibility Guidelines for Using Image Controls, Menu Controls, and AutoPostBack](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/ff7b5021-48b3-46bf-921f-9fe1e0e32202) This article provides step-by-step instructions for including accessible controls in a sample web page. It also gives some accessibility design tips for the Web.

- **Creating Accessible Web Pages with DHTML** This technical article lists HTML 4.0 elements that are accessible as well as accessible web design tips. For more information, see [Create accessible web pages with DHTML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms528445.aspx).

### Third-party resources

- **Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** This website provides guidelines and techniques for accessible website development. For more information, see [https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/).
