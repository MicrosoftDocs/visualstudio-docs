# Convert Dialog Box
The **Convert** dialog box allows you to select a conversion tool to create a new project from an old one, such as creating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvblong](../../ide/reference/includes/vbprvblong_md.md)] project from a Visual Basic 6 project. You can also use the [Visual Studio Project Converter](https://github.com/ssvaidya/VSProjectConverter) to upgrade projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio.   
  
## Opening the Convert Dialog Box  
  
#### To access the Convert dialog box  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open**, **Convert**.  
  
     You will see a list of the code-conversion tools that are currently available.  
  
2.  Select the tool that is appropriate for your application.
