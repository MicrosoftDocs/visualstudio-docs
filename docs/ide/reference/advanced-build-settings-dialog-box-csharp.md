# Advanced Build Settings dialog box (C#)

Use the **Advanced Build Settings** dialog box of the **Project Designer** to specify the project's advanced build configuration properties. This dialog box applies to C# projects only.

## General

The following options enable you to set general advanced settings.

**Language Version**

Links to [/langversion (C# compiler options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/langversion-compiler-option), which provides information about how a default language version is chosen based on a project's target framework.

**Internal Compiler Error Reporting**

Specifies whether to report compiler errors to Microsoft. If set to **prompt** (the default), you will receive a prompt if an internal compiler error occurs, giving you the option of sending an error report electronically to Microsoft. If set to **send**, an error report will be sent automatically. If set to **queue**, error reports will be queued. If set to **none**, the error will be reported only in the compiler's text output. For more information, see [/errorreport (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errorreport-compiler-option).

**Check for arithmetic overflow/underflow**

Specifies whether an integer arithmetic statement that is not in the scope of the [checked](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked) or [unchecked](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/unchecked) keywords and that results in a value outside the range of the data type will cause a run-time exception. For more information, see [/checked (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/checked-compiler-option).

**Do not reference mscorlib.dll**

Specifies whether mscorlib.dll will be imported into your program, defining the entire <xref:System> namespace. Check this box if you want to define or create your own <xref:System> namespace and objects. For more information, see [/nostdlib (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option).

## Output

The following options enable you to specify advanced output options.

**Debug Information**

Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler. For information on how to configure the debug performance of an application, see [Making an Image Easier to Debug](/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/making-an-image-easier-to-debug). This setting has the following options:

- **none**

   Specifies that no debugging information will be generated.

- **full**

   Enables attaching a debugger to the running program.

- **pdbonly**

   Allows source code debugging when the program is started in the debugger but will only display assembler when the running program is attached to the debugger.

- **portable**

   Produces a .PDB file, a non-platform-specific, portable symbol file that provides other tools, especially debuggers, information about what is in the main executable file and how it was produced. See [Portable PDB](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/diagnostics/portable-pdb.md) for more information.

- **embedded**

   Embeds portable symbol information into the assembly. No external .PDB file is produced.

For more information, see [/debug (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/debug-compiler-option).

**File Alignment**

Specifies the size of sections in the output file. Valid values are **512**, **1024**, **2048**, **4096**, and **8192**. These values are measured in bytes. Each section will be aligned on a boundary that is a multiple of this value, affecting the size of the output file. For more information, see [/filealign (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/filealign-compiler-option).

**Library Base Address**

Specifies the preferred base address at which to load a DLL. The default base address for a DLL is set by the .NET Framework common language runtime. For more information, see [/baseaddress (C# Compiler Options)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/baseaddress-compiler-option).
