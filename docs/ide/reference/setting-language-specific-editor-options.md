# Setting language-specific editor options

Visual Studio offers a variety of text editor options that apply to specific programming languages. You can configure options in the **Options** dialog box, which is accessed from the **Tools** menu. You can also configure some editor settings on a project- or codebase-basis by creating an EditorConfig file. See [Create portable, custom editor settings with EditorConfig](../../ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options.md).
