# VC++ Project Settings, Projects and Solutions, Options Dialog Box
This dialog box lets you define [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] project settings related to build logging and supporting file types.  
  
### To access this dialog box  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2.  Select **Projects and Solutions**, and then select **VC++ Project Settings**.  
  
## Build Customization Search Path  
 Specifies the list of directories that contain .rules files, which help you define build rules for your projects.  
  
## Build Logging  
 **Yes**  
 Turns on generation of the build log file. This option generates BuildLog.htm, which can be found in the project's intermediate files directory. Every fresh build overwrites the previous BuildLog.htm file.  
  
 **No**  
 Turns off generation of the build log file.  
  
## Build Timing  
 **Yes**  
 Turns on build timing. If selected, the time it takes for the build to complete is posted to the Output window. For more information, see [Output Window](../../ide/reference/output-window.md).  
  
 **No**  
 Turns off build timing.  
  
## Extensions to Hide  
 Specifies the file name extensions of files that will not be displayed in **Solution Explorer** when **Show All Files** is enabled.  
  
## Extensions to Include  
 Specifies the file name extensions of files that can be ported into your project.  
  
## Maximum concurrent C++ compilations  
 Specifies the maximum number of CPU cores to use for parallel C++ compilation.  
  
## Show Environment in Log  
 **Yes**  
 Lists environment variables in the build log file. This option specifies to echo all environment variables, during builds of [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] projects, into the build log file.  
  
 **No**  
 Exclude environment variables from the build log file.  
  
## Solution Explorer Mode  
 **Show only files in project**  
 Configures **Solution Explorer** to only display files in the project.  
  
 **Show all files**  
 Configures **Solution Explorer** to show files in the project and files on disk in the project folder.
