# How to: Build multiple configurations in a single build request

You can build most types of projects with multiple, or even all, of their build configurations with one IDE action by using the **Batch Build** dialog box. However, you can't build the following types of projects in multiple build configurations at the same time:

1. [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../debugger/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps built for Windows using JavaScript.

2. All Visual Basic projects.

3. CMake projects.

If a solution contains any project of those two project types, then **Batch Build** is not available for that solution. In that case, the command doesn't appear on the **Build** menu.

   For more information about build configurations, see [Understand build configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md).

## To build a project in multiple build configurations

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Batch Build**. Or, press **Ctrl**+**Q** to open the search box, and search for `Batch Build`.

2. In the **Build** column, select the check boxes for the configurations in which you want to build a project.

    > [!TIP]
    > To edit or create a build configuration for a solution, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager** on the menu bar to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box. After you have edited a build configuration for a solution, choose the **Rebuild** button in the **Batch Build** dialog box to update all build configurations for the projects in the solution.

3. Choose the **Build** or **Rebuild** buttons to build the project with the configurations that you specified.
