# Designing Classes and Types (Class Designer)
Using **Class Designer**, you can not only visualize classes and types, but design them as well. The following topics describe how to do this.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When working with the Class Designer, you should inspect the code it emits before executing it in order to verify that the code is appropriate for your security context.
