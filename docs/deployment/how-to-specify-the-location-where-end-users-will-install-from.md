# How to: Specify the location where end users will install from
When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application, the location where users go to download and install the application is not necessarily the location where you initially publish the application. For example, in some organizations a developer might publish an application to a staging server, and then an administrator would move the application to a Web server.

In this case, you can use the `Installation URL` property to specify the Web server where users will go to download the application. This is necessary so that the application manifest knows where to look for updates.

The `Installation URL` property can be set on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Installation URL` property can also be set using the **PublishWizard**. For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).

### To specify an Installation URL

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Publish** tab.

3. In the Installation URL field, enter the installation location using a fully qualified URL using the format `https://www.contoso.com/ApplicationName`, or a UNC path using the format `\Server\ApplicationName`.
