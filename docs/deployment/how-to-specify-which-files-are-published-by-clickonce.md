# How to: Specify which files are published by ClickOnce
When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application, all non-code files in the project are deployed along with the application. In some cases, you may not want or need to publish certain files, or you may want to install certain files based on conditions. Visual Studio provides the capabilities to exclude files, mark files as data files or prerequisites, and create groups of files for conditional installation.

 Files for a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application are managed in the **Application Files** dialog box, accessible from the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.

 Initially, there is a single file group named **(Required)**. You can create additional file groups and assign files to them. You cannot change the **Download Group** for files that are required for the application to run. For example, the application's .exe or files marked as data files must belong to the **(Required)** group.

 The default publish status value of a file is tagged with **(Auto)**. For example, the application's .exe has a publish status of **Include (Auto)** by default.

 Files with the **Build Action** property set to **Content** are designated as application files and will be marked as included by default. They can be included, excluded, or marked as data files. The exceptions are as follows:

- Data files such as SQL Database (*.mdf* and *.mdb*) files and XML files will be marked as data files by default.

- References to assemblies (*.dll* files) are designated as follows when you add the reference: If **Copy Local** is **False**, it is marked by default as a prerequisite assembly (**Prerequisite (Auto)**) that must be present in the GAC before the application is installed. If **Copy Local** is **True**, the assembly is marked by default as an application assembly (**Include (Auto)**) and will be copied into the application folder at installation. A COM reference will appear in the **Application Files** dialog box (as an *.ocx* file) only if its **Isolated** property is set to **True**. By default, it will be included.

### To add files to the Application Files dialog box

1. Select a data file in **Solution Explorer**.

2. In the Properties window, change the **Build Action** property to the **Content** value.

4. In the **Application Files** dialog box, select the file that you wish to exclude.

### To add a new file group

5. In the **Download Group** field, select **\<New...>** from the drop-down list.

6. In the **New Group** dialog box, enter a name for the group, and then click **OK**.
