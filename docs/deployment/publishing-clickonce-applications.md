# Publish ClickOnce applications
When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application for the first time, publish properties can be set using the Publish Wizard. Only a few of the properties are available in the wizard; all other properties are set to their default values.

 Subsequent changes to publish properties are made on the **Publish** page in the **Project Designer**.

## Publish Wizard
 You can use the Publish Wizard to set the basic settings for publishing your application. This includes the following publishing properties:

- Publishing Folder Location - where Visual Studio will copy the files (local computer, network file share, FTP server, or Web site)

- Installation Folder Location - where end users will install from (network file share, FTP server, Web site, CD/DVD)

- Online or Offline availability - if end users can access the application with or without a network connection

- Update frequency - how often the application checks for new updates.

  For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).

## Publish Page
 The **Publish** page of the **Project Designer** is used to configure properties for ClickOnce deployment. The following table lists topics.

|Title|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|[How to: Specify where Visual Studio copies the files](../deployment/how-to-specify-where-visual-studio-copies-the-files.md)|Describes how to set where Visual Studio puts the application files and manifests.|
|[How to: Specify the location where end users will install from](../deployment/how-to-specify-the-location-where-end-users-will-install-from.md)|Describes how to set the location where users go to download and install the application.|
|[How to: Specify the ClickOnce offline or online install mode](../deployment/how-to-specify-the-clickonce-offline-or-online-install-mode.md)|Describes how to set whether the application will be available offline or online.|
|[How to: Set the ClickOnce publish version](../deployment/how-to-set-the-clickonce-publish-version.md)|Describes how to set the ClickOnce **Publish Version** property, which determines whether or not the application that you are publishing will be treated as an update.|
|[How to: Automatically increment the ClickOnce publish version](../deployment/how-to-automatically-increment-the-clickonce-publish-version.md)|Describes how to automatically increment the Revision number of the **PublishVersion** each time you publish the application.|

 For more information, see [Publish Page, Project Designer](../ide/reference/publish-page-project-designer.md)

### Application Files dialog box
 This dialog box allows you to specify how the files in your project are categorized for publishing, dynamic downloading, and updating. It contains a grid that lists the project files that are not excluded by default, or that have a download group.

 To exclude files, mark files as data files or prerequisites, and create groups of files for conditional installation in the Visual Studio UI, see [How to: Specify which files are published by ClickOnce](../deployment/how-to-specify-which-files-are-published-by-clickonce.md). You can also mark data files by using the Mage.exe. For more information, see [How to: Include a data file in a ClickOnce application](../deployment/how-to-include-a-data-file-in-a-clickonce-application.md).

### Prerequisites dialog box
 This dialog box specifies which prerequisite components are installed, as well as how they are installed. For more information, see [How to: Install prerequisites with a ClickOnce application](../deployment/how-to-install-prerequisites-with-a-clickonce-application.md) and [Prerequisites dialog box](../ide/reference/prerequisites-dialog-box.md).

### Application Updates dialog box
 This dialog box specifies how the application installation should check for updates. For more information, see [How to: Manage updates for a ClickOnce application](../deployment/how-to-manage-updates-for-a-clickonce-application.md).

### Publish Options dialog box
 The Publish Options dialog box specifies an application's deployment options.
