# How to: Disable URL activation of ClickOnce applications

Typically, a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application will launch automatically immediately after it is installed from a Web server. For security reasons, you may decide to disable this behavior, and tell users to launch the application from the **Start** menu instead. The following procedure describes how to disable URL activation.

This technique can be used only for [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] applications installed on the user's computer from a Web server. It cannot be used for online-only applications, which can be launched only by using their URL. For more information on the difference between online-only and installed applications, see [Choosing a ClickOnce Deployment Strategy](../deployment/choosing-a-clickonce-deployment-strategy.md).

This procedure uses the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) tool MageUI.exe. For more information on this tool, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](/dotnet/framework/tools/mageui-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool-graphical-client). You can also perform this procedure using Visual Studio.

## Procedure

### To disable URL activation for your application

1. Open your deployment manifest in MageUI.exe. If you have not yet created one, follow the steps in [Walkthrough: Manually deploy a ClickOnce application](../deployment/walkthrough-manually-deploying-a-clickonce-application.md).

2. Select the **Deployment Options** tab.

3. Clear the **Automatically run application after installing** check box.

4. Save and sign the manifest.
