# How to: Set a security zone for a ClickOnce application
When setting code access security permissions for a ClickOnce application, you need to start with a base set of permissions on the **Security** page of the **Project Designer**.

 In most cases, you can also choose the **Internet** zone which contains a limited set of permissions, or the **Local Intranet** zone which contains a greater set of permissions. If your application requires custom permissions, you can do so by choosing the **Custom** security zone. For more information about setting custom permissions, see [How to: Set Custom Permissions for a ClickOnce Application](../deployment/how-to-set-custom-permissions-for-a-clickonce-application.md).

### To set a security zone

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Security** tab.

3. Select the **Enable ClickOnce Security Settings** check box.

4. Select the **This is a partial trust application** option button.

     The controls in the **ClickOnce security permissions** section are enabled.

5. In the **Zone your application will be installed from** drop-down list, select a security zone.
