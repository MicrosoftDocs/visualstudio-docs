# Publish a Web app to a web site using Visual Studio

You can use the **Publish** tool to publish ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, and Python apps to a website from Visual Studio. For Node.js, the steps are supported but the user interface is different.

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-prereqs](includes/quickstart-prereqs.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to publish a Windows desktop application to a network file share, see [Deploy a desktop app using ClickOnce](how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md) (C# or Visual Basic). For C++/CLR, see [Deploy a native app using ClickOnce](/cpp/windows/clickonce-deployment-for-visual-cpp-applications) or, for C/C++, see [Deploy a native app using a Setup project](/cpp/windows/walkthrough-deploying-a-visual-cpp-application-by-using-a-setup-project).

## Publish to a Web site

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project and choose **Publish** (or use the **Build** > **Publish** menu item).

    ![The Publish command on the project context menu in Solution Explorer](../deployment/media/quickstart-publish.png "Choose Publish")

1. If you have previously configured any publishing profiles, the **Publish** pane appears. Select **Create new profile**.

1. In the **Publish** dialog box, choose **Web Server (IIS)**.

1. Choose **Web Deploy** as the deployment method. Web Deploy simplifies deployment of Web applications and Web sites to IIS servers, and must be installed as an application on the server. Use the [Web platform installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) to install it.
