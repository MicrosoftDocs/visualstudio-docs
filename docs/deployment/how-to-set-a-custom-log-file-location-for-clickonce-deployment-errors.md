# How to: Set a custom log file location for ClickOnce deployment errors
[!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] maintains activation log files for all deployments. These logs document any errors pertaining to installing and initializing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] creates one log file for each deployment activation. It stores these log files in the Temporary Internet Files folder. The log file for a deployment is displayed to the user when an activation failure occurs, and the user clicks **Details** in the resulting error dialog box.

 You can change this behavior for a specific client by using Registry Editor (**regedit.exe**) to set a custom log file path. In this case, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] logs activation successes and failures for all deployments in a single file.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to truncate or delete the log file occasionally to prevent it from growing too large.

 The following procedure describes how to set a custom log file location for a single client.

### To set a custom log file location

1. Open **Regedit.exe**.

2. Navigate to the node `HKCU\Software\Classes\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Deployment`.

3. Set the string value `LogFilePath` to the full path and filename of your preferred custom log location.

     This location must be in a directory to which the user has write access. For example, on Windows Vista, create the following folder structure and set `LogFilePath` to *C:\Users\\\<username>\Documents\Logs\ClickOnce\installation.log*.
