# Walkthrough: Download satellite assemblies on demand with the ClickOnce deployment API using the Designer
Windows Forms applications can be configured for multiple cultures through the use of satellite assemblies. A *satellite assembly* is an assembly that contains application resources for a culture other than the application's default culture.

 As discussed in [Localizing ClickOnce Applications](../deployment/localizing-clickonce-applications.md), you can include multiple satellite assemblies for multiple cultures within the same [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] will download all of the satellite assemblies in your deployment to the client machine, although a single client will probably require only one satellite assembly.

 This walkthrough demonstrates how to mark your satellite assemblies as optional, and download only the assembly a client machine needs for its current culture settings.

> [!NOTE]
>  For testing purposes, the following code examples programmatically set the culture to `ja-JP`. See the "Next Steps" section later in this topic for information on how to adjust this code for a production environment.

### To mark satellite assemblies as optional

1.  Build your project. This will generate satellite assemblies for all of the cultures you are localizing to.

2.  Right-click on your project name in Solution Explorer, and click **Properties**.

3.  Click the **Publish** tab, and then click **Application Files**.

4.  Select the **Show all files** check box to display satellite assemblies. By default, all satellite assemblies will be included in your deployment and will be visible in this dialog box.

     A satellite assembly will have a name in the form *\<isoCode>\ApplicationName.resources.dll*, where \<isoCode> is a language identifier in RFC 1766 format.

5.  Click **New** in the **Download Group** list for each language identifier. When prompted for a download group name, enter the language identifier. For example, for a Japanese satellite assembly, you would specify the download group name `ja-JP`.

6.  Close the **Application Files** dialog box.

### To download satellite assemblies on demand in C\#

1.  Open the *Program.cs* file. If you do not see this file in Solution Explorer, select your project, and on the **Project** menu, click **Show All Files**.

2.  Use the following code to download the appropriate satellite assembly and start your application.

     [!code-csharp[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssemblies#1](../deployment/codesnippet/CSharp/walkthrough-downloading-satellite-assemblies-on-demand-with-the-clickonce-deployment-api-using-the-designer_1.cs)]

### To download satellite assemblies on demand in Visual Basic

1.  In the **Properties** window for the application, click the **Application** tab.

2.  At the bottom of the tab page, click **View Application Events**.

3.  Add the following imports to the beginning of the *ApplicationEvents.VB* file.

     [!code-vb[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#1](../deployment/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-downloading-satellite-assemblies-on-demand-with-the-clickonce-deployment-api-using-the-designer_2.vb)]

4.  Add the following code to the `MyApplication` class.

     [!code-vb[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#2](../deployment/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-downloading-satellite-assemblies-on-demand-with-the-clickonce-deployment-api-using-the-designer_3.vb)]

## Next steps
 In a production environment, you will likely need to remove the line in the code examples that sets <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> to a specific value, because client machines will have the correct value set by default. When your application runs on a Japanese client machine, for example, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> will be `ja-JP` by default. Setting it programmatically is a good way to test your satellite assemblies before you deploy your application.
