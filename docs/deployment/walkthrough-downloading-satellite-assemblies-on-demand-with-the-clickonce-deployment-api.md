# Walkthrough: Download satellite assemblies on demand with the ClickOnce deployment API
Windows Forms applications can be configured for multiple cultures through the use of satellite assemblies. A *satellite assembly* is an assembly that contains application resources for a culture other than the application's default culture.

 As discussed in [Localize ClickOnce applications](../deployment/localizing-clickonce-applications.md), you can include multiple satellite assemblies for multiple cultures within the same [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] will download all of the satellite assemblies in your deployment to the client machine, although a single client will probably require only one satellite assembly.

 This walkthrough demonstrates how to mark your satellite assemblies as optional, and download only the assembly a client machine needs for its current culture settings. The following procedure uses the tools available in the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../deployment/includes/winsdklong_md.md)]. You can also perform this task in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  Also see [Walkthrough: Download satellite assemblies on demand with the ClickOnce deployment API using the Designer](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012/ms366788(v=vs.110)) or [Walkthrough: Download satellite assemblies on demand with the ClickOnce deployment API using the Designer](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/ms366788(v=vs.120)).

> [!NOTE]
> For testing purposes, the following code example programmatically sets the culture to `ja-JP`. See the "Next Steps" section later in this topic for information on how to adjust this code for a production environment.

## Prerequisites
 This topic assumes that you know how to add localized resources to your application using Visual Studio. For detailed instructions, see [Walkthrough: Localize Windows forms](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/y99d1cd3(v=vs.100)).

### To download satellite assemblies on demand

1. Add the following code to your application to enable on-demand downloading of satellite assemblies.

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK/CS/Program.cs" id="Snippet1":::
    :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK/VB/Form1.vb" id="Snippet1":::

2. Generate satellite assemblies for your application by using [Resgen.exe (Resource File Generator)](/dotnet/framework/tools/resgen-exe-resource-file-generator) or [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

3. Generate an application manifest, or open your existing application manifest, by using *MageUI.exe*. For more information about this tool, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](/dotnet/framework/tools/mageui-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool-graphical-client).

4. Click the **Files** tab.

5. Click the **ellipsis** button (**...**) and select the directory containing all of your application's assemblies and files, including the satellite assemblies you generated using *Resgen.exe*. (A satellite assembly will have a name in the form *\<isoCode>\ApplicationName.resources.dll*, where \<isoCode> is a language identifier in RFC 1766 format.)

6. Click **Populate** to add the files to your deployment.

7. Select the **Optional** check box for each satellite assembly.

8. Set the group field for each satellite assembly to its ISO language identifier. For example, for a Japanese satellite assembly, you would specify a download group name of `ja-JP`. This will enable the code you added in step 1 to download the appropriate satellite assembly, depending upon the user's <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property setting.

## Next steps
 In a production environment, you will likely need to remove the line in the code example that sets <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> to a specific value, because client machines will have the correct value set by default. When your application runs on a Japanese client machine, for example, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> will be `ja-JP` by default. Setting this value programmatically is a good way to test your satellite assemblies before you deploy your application.
