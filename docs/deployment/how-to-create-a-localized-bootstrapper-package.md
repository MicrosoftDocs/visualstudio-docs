# How to: Create a localized bootstrapper package
After you create a bootstrapper package, you can create localized versions of the bootstrapper package by creating two more files for each locale: a software license terms file (such as a *eula.rtf*) and a package manifest (*package.xml*).

 By default, Visual Studio 2010 includes localized bootstrapper packages only for .NET Framework 4, .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, F# Runtime 2.0, and F# Runtime 4.0. You can create localized packages for other bootstrappers by completing three steps.

1. Create a folder that is named after the locale name in *\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\\\<BootstrapperPackageName>*.

2. Create a file that contains the software license terms for the bootstrapper package and put it in the new folder.

3. Create a package manifest named *package.xml*, update the strings and culture, and put the file in the new folder. If you have already created a bootstrapper of Visual Studio in the target language, you can copy the Visual Studio *package.xml* file and modify it in this step.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a Setup project to deploy applications, you can localize your application by changing the **Localization** property.

### To create a localized bootstrapper package

1. Create a folder that is named after the locale name.

     On 32-bit computers, create the folder in the *\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\\\<BootstrapperPackageName>\\* folder.

     On 64-bit computers, create the folder in the *\Program Files (86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\\\<BootstrapperPackageName>\\* folder.

     The following table shows the folder names that you can use to match a locale.

    |Locale|Folder name|
    |------------|-----------------|
    |Chinese (Simplified)|zh-Hans|
    |Chinese (Traditional)|zh-Hant|
    |Czech|cs|
    |German|de|
    |English|en|
    |Spanish|es|
    |French|fr|
    |Italian|it|
    |Korean|ko|
    |Japanese|ja|
    |Polish|pl|
    |Portuguese (Brazil)|pt-BR|
    |Russian|ru|
    |Turkish|tr|

2. Create a file that contains the software license terms for the bootstrapper package and put it in the new folder.

3. Create a package manifest named *package.xml* and put it in the new folder. For more information, see [How to: Create a package manifest](../deployment/how-to-create-a-package-manifest.md).

4. Update the `<Strings>` section of the package manifest so that the strings are in the correct language for the locale.

5. Change the `<String Name="Culture">` value to match the folder name.

6. Save the *package.xml* file.

### To create a bootstrapper package for .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 localized in French

1. Create a folder that is named *fr*. The folder name must match the locale name.

     On 32-bit computers, create the folder in the *\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\DotNetFX35SP1\\* folder.

     On 64-bit computers, create the folder in the *\Program Files (86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\DotNetFX35SP1\\* folder.

2. Put a localized version of the software license terms into the *fr* folder.

3. Copy the *\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\DotNetFX35SP1\en\package.xml* file to the *fr* folder, and open the file in the XML Designer.

4. Update the `<Strings>` section of the package manifest so that the error strings are in French.

5. Change the `<String Name="Culture">` value to *fr*.

6. Save the *package.xml* file.
