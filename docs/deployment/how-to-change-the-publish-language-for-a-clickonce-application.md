# How to: Change the publish language for a ClickOnce application

When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application, the user interface displayed during installation defaults to the language and culture of your development computer. If you are publishing a localized application, you will need to specify a language and culture to match the localized version. This is determined by the `Publish language` property for your project.

The `Publish language` property can be set in the **Publish Options** dialog box, accessible from the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../ide/environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## To change the publish language

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Publish** tab.

3. Click the **Options** button to open the **Publish Options** dialog box.

4. Click **Description**.

5. In the **Publish Options** dialog box, select a language and culture from the **Publish language** drop-down list, and then click **OK**.
