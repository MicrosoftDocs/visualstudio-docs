# How to: Create a package manifest
To deploy prerequisites for your application, you can use a bootstrapper package. A bootstrapper package contains a single product manifest file but a package manifest for each locale. Shared functionality across different localized versions should go into the product manifest.

 For more information about product manifests, see [How to: Create a product manifest](../deployment/how-to-create-a-product-manifest.md).

## Create the package manifest

#### To create the package manifest

1. Create a directory for the bootstrapper package. This example uses *C:\package*.

2. Create a subdirectory with the name of the locale, such as *en* for English.

3. In Visual Studio, create an XML file that is named *package.xml*, and save it to the *C:\package\en* folder.

4. Add XML to list the name of the bootstrapper package, the culture for this localized package manifest, and the optional license agreement. The following XML uses the variables `DisplayName` and `Culture`, which are defined in a later element.

    ```xml
    <Package
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/2004/01/bootstrapper"
        Name="DisplayName"
        Culture="Culture"
        LicenseAgreement="eula.txt">
    ```

5. Add XML to list all the files that are in the locale-specific directory. The following XML uses a file that is named *eula.txt* that is applicable for the **en** locale.

    ```xml
    <PackageFiles>
      <PackageFile Name="eula.txt"/>
    </PackageFiles>
    ```

6. Add XML to define localizable strings for the bootstrapper package. The following XML adds error strings for the **en** locale.

    ```xml
      <Strings>
        <String Name="DisplayName">Custom Bootstrapper Package</String>
        <String Name="CultureName">en</String>
        <String Name="NotAnAdmin">You must be an administrator to install
    this package.</String>
        <String Name="GeneralFailure">A general error has occurred while
    installing this package.</String>
    </Strings>
    ```

7. Copy the *C:\package* folder to the Visual Studio bootstrapper directory. For Visual Studio 2010, this is the *\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages* directory.

## Example
 The package manifest contains locale-specific information, such as error messages, software license terms, and language packs.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Package
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/2004/01/bootstrapper"
  Name="DisplayName"
  Culture="Culture"
  LicenseAgreement="eula.txt">

  <PackageFiles>
    <PackageFile Name="eula.txt"/>
  </PackageFiles>

  <Strings>
    <String Name="DisplayName">Custom Bootstrapper Package</String>
    <String Name="Culture">en</String>
    <String Name="NotAnAdmin">You must be an administrator to install this package.</String>
    <String Name="GeneralFailure">A general error has occurred while
installing this package.</String>
  </Strings>
</Package>
```
