# How to: Automatically increment the ClickOnce publish version

When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application, changing the `Publish Version` property causes the application to be published as an update. By default, Visual Studio automatically increments the `Revision` number of the `Publish Version` each time you publish the application.

You can disable this behavior on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../ide/environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## To disable automatically incrementing the publish version

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Publish** tab.

3. In the **Publish Version** section, clear the **Automatically increment revision with each release** check box.
