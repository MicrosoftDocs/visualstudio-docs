# Deploy an app to a folder using Visual Studio

You can use the **Publish** tool to publish ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, and Python apps to a folder from Visual Studio. For Node.js, the steps are supported but the user interface is different.

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-prereqs](includes/quickstart-prereqs.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to publish a .NET 3.1, or newer, Windows desktop application to a folder, see [Deploy a .NET Windows application using ClickOnce](quickstart-deploy-using-clickonce-folder.md). For .NET Framework Windows desktop applications see [Deploy a desktop app using ClickOnce](how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md) (C# or Visual Basic)
. For C++/CLR, see [Deploy a native app using ClickOnce](/cpp/windows/clickonce-deployment-for-visual-cpp-applications) or, for C/C++, see [Deploy a native app using a Setup project](/cpp/windows/walkthrough-deploying-a-visual-cpp-application-by-using-a-setup-project).

## Deploy to a local folder

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project and choose **Publish** (or use the **Build** > **Publish** menu item).

    ![The Publish command on the project context menu in Solution Explorer](../deployment/media/quickstart-publish.png "Choose Publish")

1. If you have previously configured any publishing profiles, the **Publish** window appears. Select **New**.

1. In the **Publish** window, select **Folder**.

    ![Choose folder as a publish target](../deployment/media/quickstart-publish-folder-new.png "Choose Folder")

1. If you are deploying a .NET 3.1, or newer, Windows Application you may need to select **Folder** in the **Specific target** window.

1. If you wish to publish a .NET 3.1, or newer, Windows application with ClickOnce, see [Deploy a .NET Windows application using ClickOnce](quickstart-deploy-using-clickonce-folder.md).

1. Enter a path or select **Browse** to specify a folder.

    ![Specify the path to the folder](../deployment/media/quickstart-publish-folder-path.png "Choose Folder")

1. Select **Publish**. Visual Studio builds the project and publishes it to the specified folder. The project properties **Publish** pane appears, showing a profile summary.

    ![Publish property pane showing a profile summary](../deployment/media/quickstart-publish-folder-summary.png)

1. To configure deployment settings, select **Edit** in the publish profile summary and select the **Settings** tab.

   The settings you see depend on your application type. The following illustration shows example settings for an ASP.NET Core app.

    ![Profile settings](../deployment/media/quickstart-profile-settings.png "Profile settings")

    For additional help to choose settings in .NET, see the following:

    - [Framework-dependent vs. self-contained deployment](/dotnet/core/deploying/)
    - [Target runtime identifiers (portable RID, et al)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)
    - [Debug and release configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md)

1. Configure options such as whether to deploy a Debug or Release configuration, and then select **Save**.

1. To republish, select **Publish**.

Deploy the published files in any way you like. For example, you can package them in a *.zip* file, use a simple copy command, or deploy them with any installation package of your choice.
