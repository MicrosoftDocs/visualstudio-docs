# Deploy an app to a local folder using Visual Studio

You can use the **Publish** tool to publish ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, and Python apps to a local folder from Visual Studio. For Node.js, the steps are supported but the user interface is different.

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-prereqs](includes/quickstart-prereqs.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to publish a Windows desktop application to a local folder, see [Deploy a desktop app using ClickOnce](how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md) (C# or Visual Basic). For C++/CLR, see [Deploy a native app using ClickOnce](/cpp/windows/clickonce-deployment-for-visual-cpp-applications) or, for C/C++, see [Deploy a native app using a Setup project](/cpp/windows/walkthrough-deploying-a-visual-cpp-application-by-using-a-setup-project).

## Deploy to a local folder

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project and choose **Publish** (or use the **Build** > **Publish** menu item).

1. In the **Publish** dialog, select **Folder**.

1. Enter a path or select **Browse** to specify a folder.

1. Select **Publish**. Visual Studio builds the project and publishes it to the specified folder. The project properties **Publish** pane appears, showing a profile summary.

1. To configure deployment settings, select **Edit** in the publish profile summary and select the **Settings** tab.

1. Configure options such as whether to deploy a Debug or Release configuration, and then select **Save**.

1. To republish, select **Publish**.

Deploy the published files in any way you like. For example, you can package them in a *.zip* file, use a simple copy command, or deploy them with any installation package of your choice.
