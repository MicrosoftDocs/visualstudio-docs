> [!NOTE]
> In ClickOnce for .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 or later, you set deployment properties using the Publish tool instead of the Publish wizard and the Publish page of the Project Designer. For more information, see [Deploy a .NET Windows application using ClickOnce](../../deployment/quickstart-deploy-using-clickonce-folder.md) and [ClickOnce for .NET](../../deployment/clickonce-deployment-dotnet.md).
