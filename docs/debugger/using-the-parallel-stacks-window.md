# View threads and tasks in the Parallel Stacks window (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

The **Parallel Stacks** window is useful for debugging multithreaded applications. It has several views:

- [Threads view](#threads-view) shows call stack information for all threads in the app. You can navigate between threads and stack frames on those threads.

- [Tasks view](#tasks-view) shows task-centered call stack information.
  - In managed code, **Tasks** view shows call stacks of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=fullName> objects.
  - In native code, **Tasks** view shows call stacks of [task groups](/cpp/parallel/concrt/task-parallelism-concurrency-runtime), [parallel algorithms](/cpp/parallel/concrt/parallel-algorithms), [asynchronous agents](/cpp/parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents), and [lightweight tasks](/cpp/parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime).

- [Method View](#method-view) pivots the call stack on a selected method.

## Use the Parallel Stacks window

To open the **Parallel Stacks** window, you must be in a debugging session. Select **Debug** > **Windows** > **Parallel Stacks**.

### Toolbar controls

The **Parallel Stacks** window has the following toolbar controls:
::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Screenshot of Toolbar in Parallel Stacks window.](../debugger/media/parallel-stackstoolbar.png "Parallel Stacks toolbar.")

|Icon|Control|Description|
|-|-|-|
|![Threads/Tasks combo box](media/parallel-toolbar1.png "Threads/Tasks combo box")|**Threads**/**Tasks** combo box|Switches the view between call stacks of threads and call stacks of tasks. For more information, see [Tasks view](#tasks-view) and [Threads view](#threads-view).|
|![Show Only Flagged icon](media/parallel-toolbar2.png "Show Only Flagged icon")|Show Only Flagged|Shows call stacks only for the threads that are flagged in other debugger windows, such as the **GPU Threads** window and the **Parallel Watch** window.|

::: moniker-end

### Context menu items
The following shortcut menu items are available when you right-click a method in **Threads** view or **Tasks** view. The last six items are the same as in the [Call Stack window](how-to-use-the-call-stack-window.md).

## Threads view

In **Threads** view, the stack frame and call path of the current thread are highlighted in blue. The current location of the thread is shown by the yellow arrow.

To change the current stack frame, double-click a different method. This might also switch the current thread, depending on whether the method you select is part of the current thread or another thread.

When the **Threads** view graph is too large to fit into the window, a **Bird's Eye View** control appears in the window. You can move the frame in the control to navigate to different parts of the graph.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

The following illustration shows one thread that goes from Main to a Managed to Native code transition. Six threads are in the current method. Two threads continue to Thread.Sleep, and two continue to Console.WriteLine and the current thread continues to SyncTextWriter.WriteLine.

 ![Screenshot of Threads view in Parallel Stacks window.](../debugger/media/parallel-stack1.png "Threads view in Parallel Stacks window.")

The following table describes the main features of the **Threads** view:

|Callout|Element name|Description|
|-|-|-|
|1|Call stack segment or node|Contains a series of methods for one or more threads. If the frame has no arrow lines connected to it, the frame shows the entire call path for the thread(s).|
|2|Blue highlight|Indicates the call path of the current thread.|
|3|Arrow lines|Connect nodes to make up the entire call path for the thread(s).|
|4|Node header|Shows the number of processes and threads for the node.|
|5|Method|Represents one or more stack frames in the same method.|
|6|Tooltip on method|Appears when you hover over a method. In **Threads** view, the tooltip shows all threads, in a table similar to the **Threads** window. |

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"

The following illustration shows the Main thread in a Managed to Native code transition. Five threads are in the current method. Four threads continue executing in the S.C method context, while one worker thread continues in a Managed to Native code transition, setting the name on a worker thread.

 [![Screenshot of Threads view in Parallel Stacks window 2022.](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-toolbar-threads-view.png "Threads view in Parallel Stacks window.")](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-toolbar-threads-view.png#lightbox)

The following table describes the main features of the **Threads** view:

|Callout|Element name|Description|
|-|-|-|
|1|Call stack segment or node|Contains a series of methods for one or more threads. If the frame has no arrow lines connected to it, the frame shows the entire call path for the thread(s).|
|2|Blue highlight|Indicates the call path of the current thread.|
|3|Arrow lines|Connect nodes to make up the entire call path for the thread(s).|
|4|Node header|Shows the number of processes/threads, thread name, and thread ID for the node.|
|5|Method|Represents one or more stack frames in the same method.|
|6|Tooltip on method|Appears when you hover over a method. In **Threads** view, the tooltip shows all threads, in a table similar to the **Threads** window. |
|7|Thread description|AI-generated description of the thread. Starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13 Preview 1, this description is present when [Copilot](../ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-install-and-states.md) is installed and activated. |

## Tasks view
If your app uses <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=fullName> objects (managed code) or `task_handle` objects (native code) to express parallelism, you can use **Tasks** view. **Tasks** view shows call stacks of tasks instead of threads.

In **Tasks** view:

- Call stacks of threads that aren't running tasks aren't shown.
- Call stacks of threads that are running tasks are visually trimmed at the top and bottom, to show the most relevant frames for tasks.
- When several tasks are on one thread, the call stacks of those tasks are shown in separate nodes.

To see an entire call stack, switch back to **Threads** view by right-clicking in a stack frame and selecting **Go to Thread**.

The following illustration shows the **Threads** view at the top and the corresponding **Tasks** view at the bottom.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
![Screenshot of Threads and Tasks views.](../debugger/media/parallel-threads-tasks.png "Threads and Tasks views.")

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
[![Screenshot of Tasks view in Parallel Stacks window.](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-toolbar-threads-tasks-view.png "Tasks view in Parallel Stacks window.")](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-toolbar-threads-tasks-view.png#lightbox)
::: moniker-end

Hover over a method to show a tooltip with additional information. In **Tasks** view, the tooltip shows all the tasks in a table similar to the **Tasks** window.

The following image shows the tooltip for a method in the **Threads** view at the top and for the corresponding **Tasks** view at the bottom.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

![Screenshot of Threads and Tasks tooltips.](../debugger/media/parallel-threads-tasks-tooltips.png "Threads and Tasks tooltips.")

::: moniker-end
## Method View
From either **Threads** view or **Tasks** view, you can pivot the graph on the current method by selecting the **Toggle Method View** icon on the toolbar. **Method View** shows at a glance all methods on all threads that either call or are called by the current method. The following illustration shows how the same information looks in **Threads** view on the left and in **Method View** on the right.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

[![Screenshot of Methods view in Parallel Stacks window.](../debugger/media/parallel-methodview.png "Methods view in Parallel Stacks window.")](../debugger/media/parallel-methodview.png#lightbox)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
[![Screenshot of Methods view in Parallel Stacks window 2022.](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-methods-view.png "Methods view in Parallel Stacks window.")](../debugger/media/vs-2022/parallel-stacks-methods-view.png#lightbox)
::: moniker-end

If you switch to a new stack frame, you make that method the current method, and **Method View** shows all callers and callees for the new method. This may cause some threads to appear or disappear from the view, depending on whether that method appears on their call stacks. To return to the call stack view, select the **Method View** toolbar icon again.
