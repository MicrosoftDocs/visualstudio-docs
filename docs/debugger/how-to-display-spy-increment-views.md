# How to: Display Spy++ Views
When Spy++ starts, it opens in [Windows View](../debugger/windows-view.md), a tree view of all windows and controls available on your machine. This root window is captioned "Windows 1." There are also three other Spy++ views available: [Messages View](../debugger/messages-view.md), [Processes View](../debugger/processes-view.md), and [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md). You can display the desired view from the **Spy** menu. For more information, see [Spy++ Views](../debugger/spy-increment-views.md).
