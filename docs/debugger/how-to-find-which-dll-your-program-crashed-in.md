# How to: Find Which DLL Your Program Crashed In (C#, C++, Visual Basic, F#)

 If your application crashes during a call to a system DLL or someone else's code, you need to find out which DLL was active when the crash occurred. If you experience a crash in a DLL outside your own program, you can identify the location using the **Modules** window.

### To find where a crash occurred using the Modules window

1. Note the address where the crash occurred.

    If the address is not shown in the error message, you may need to use alternative methods to identify the DLL. If you suspect a system DLL, you can [load symbols](../debugger/specify-symbol-dot-pdb-and-source-files-in-the-visual-studio-debugger.md) from the Microsoft Symbol Servers when debugging. Otherwise, you may need to [create a dump file](../debugger/using-dump-files.md) with heap information instead. Various [tools](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/andrehal/2009/12/31/what-is-a-dump-and-how-do-i-create-one/) are available to create dump files.

2. On the **Debug** menu, choose **Windows**, and click **Modules**.

3. In the **Modules** window, find the **Address** column. You may need to use the scrollbar to see it.

4. Click the **Address** button at the top of the column to sort the DLLs by address.

5. Scan the sorted list to find the DLL whose address range contains the crash location.

6. Look at the **Name** and **Path** columns to see the DLL name and path.
