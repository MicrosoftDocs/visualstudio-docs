# How to: Debug a Self-Hosted WCF Service
A *self-hosted service* is a WCF service that does not run inside IIS, the WCF Service Host, or the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Development Server. The easiest way to debug a self-hosted WCF is to configure [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to launch both client and server when you choose **Start Debugging** on the **Debug** menu.

 If the WCF service is self-hosting inside or a process that cannot be launched in this manner, such as NT service, you cannot use this method. Instead, you can do one of the following:

- Manually attach the debugger to the hosting process. For more information, see [Attach to Running Processes](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).

     — or —

- Start debugging the client, and then step into a call to the service. This requires that you enable debugging in the app.config file. For more information, [Limitations on WCF Debugging](../debugger/limitations-on-wcf-debugging.md).

### To start both client and host from Visual Studio

1. Create a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] solution that contains both the client and server projects.

2. Configure the solution to start both client and server processes when you choose **Start** on the **Debug** menu.

   1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the solution name.

   2. Click **Set Startup Projects**.

   3. In the **Solution \<name> Properties** dialog box, select **Multiple Startup Projects**.

   4. In the **Multiple Startup Projects** grid, on the line that corresponds to the server project, click **Action** and choose **Start**.

   5. On the line that corresponds to the client project, click **Action** and choose **Start**.

   6. Click **OK**.
