# How to: Debug On a High-Performance Cluster (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

Debugging a multiprocessing program on a high-performance cluster is like debugging an ordinary program on a remote computer. However, there are some additional considerations. For general remote setup requirements, see [Remote Debugging](../debugger/remote-debugging.md).

 When you debug on a high-performance cluster, you can use all the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugging windows and techniques that are available for remote debugging. Because you are debugging remotely, however, the external console window is not available.

 The **Threads** window and **Processes** window are especially useful for debugging parallel applications. For tips on how to use these windows, see [How to: Use the Processes Window](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/7h8h5sdw(v=vs.100)) and [Walkthrough: Debug using the Threads Window](../debugger/how-to-use-the-threads-window.md).

 The following procedures show some techniques that are especially useful for debugging on a high-performance cluster.

 When you debug a parallel application, you might want to set a breakpoint on a particular thread, process, or computer. You can do this by creating a normal breakpoint, and then adding a breakpoint filter.

### To open the Breakpoint Filter dialog box

1. Right-click a breakpoint glyph in a source window, the **Disassembly** window, the **Call Stack** window, or the **Breakpoints** window.

2. On the shortcut menu, click **Filter**. This option may appear at the top level or in the submenu under **Breakpoints**.

### To set a breakpoint on a specific computer

1. Get the computer name from the **Processes** window.

2. Select a breakpoint, and open the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box as described in the previous procedure.

3. In the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box, type:

     MachineName =*yourmachinename*

     To create a more complex filter, you can combine clauses using `&`, the AND operator, `||`, the OR operator, `!`, the NOT operator, and parentheses.

4. Click **OK**.

### To set a breakpoint on a specific process

1. Get the process name or process ID number from the **Processes** window.

2. Select a breakpoint, and open the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box as in the first procedure.

3. In the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box, type:

     `ProcessName =`  *yourprocessname*

     —or—

     `ProcessID =` *yourprocessIDnumber*

     To create a more complex filter, you can combine clauses using `&`, the AND operator, `||`, the OR operator, `!`, the NOT operator, and parentheses.

4. Click **OK**.

### To set a breakpoint on a specific thread

1. Get the thread name or thread ID number from the **Threads** window.

2. Select a breakpoint, and open the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box as described in the first procedure.

3. In the **Breakpoint Filter** dialog box, type:

     `ThreadName =` *yourthreadname*

     —or—

     `ThreadID =` *yourthreadIDnumber*

     To create a more complex filter, you can combine clauses using `&`, the AND operator, `||`, the OR operator, `!`, the NOT operator, and parentheses.

4. Click **OK**.

## Example
 The following example shows how to create a filter for a breakpoint on a computer named `marvin` and a thread named `fourier1`.

`(MachineName = marvin) & (ThreadName = fourier1)`
