# Walkthrough: Debug a multithreaded app using the Threads window (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

Several Visual Studio user interface elements help you debug multithreaded apps. This article introduces multithreaded debugging features in the code editor window, **Debug Location** toolbar, and **Threads** window. For information about other tools for debugging multithreaded apps, see [Get started debugging multithreaded apps](../debugger/get-started-debugging-multithreaded-apps.md).

Completing this tutorial takes only a few minutes, and familiarizes you with the basics of debugging multithreaded apps.

## Create a multithreaded app project

Create the following multithreaded app project to use in this tutorial:

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project.

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

   If the start window is not open, choose **File** > **Start Window**.

   On the start window, choose **Create a new project**.

   On the **Create a new project** window, enter or type *console* in the search box. Next, choose **C#** or **C++** from the Language list, and then choose **Windows** from the Platform list. 

   After you apply the language and platform filters, choose the **Console App (.NET Core)** or, for C++, **Console App** template, and then choose **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see the correct template, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Choose the **.NET desktop development** or **Desktop development with C++** workload, then choose **Modify**.

   In the **Configure your new project** window, type or enter *MyThreadWalkthroughApp* in the **Project name** box. Then, choose **Create**.

   ::: moniker-end
   ::: moniker range="vs-2017"
   From the top menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project**. In the left pane of the **New project** dialog box, choose the following:

   - For a C# app, under **Visual C#**, choose **Windows Desktop**, and then in the middle pane choose **Console App (.NET Framework)**.
   - For a C++ app, under **Visual C++**, choose **Windows Desktop**,, and then choose **Windows Console Application**.

   If you don't see the **Console App (.NET Core)** or, for C++, the **Console App** project template, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Choose the **.NET desktop development** or **Desktop development with C++** workload, then choose **Modify**.

   Then, type a name like *MyThreadWalkthroughApp* and click **OK**.

   Select **OK**.
   ::: moniker-end

   A new console project appears. After the project has been created, a source file appears. Depending on the language you have chosen, the source file might be called *Program.cs*, *MyThreadWalkthroughApp.cpp*, or *Module1.vb*.

1. Replace the code in the source file with the C# or C++ example code from [Get started debugging multithreaded apps](../debugger/get-started-debugging-multithreaded-apps.md).

1. Select **File** > **Save All**.

## Start debugging

1. Find the following lines in the source code:

   ```csharp
   Thread.Sleep(3000);
   Console.WriteLine();
   ```

   ```C++
   Thread::Sleep(3000);
   Console.WriteLine();
   ```

1. Set a breakpoint on the `Console.WriteLine();` line by clicking in the left gutter, or selecting the line and pressing **F9**.

   The breakpoint appears as a red circle in the left gutter next to the code line.

1. Select **Debug** > **Start Debugging**, or press **F5**.

   The app starts in debug mode, and pauses at the breakpoint.

1. While in break mode, open the **Threads** window by selecting **Debug** > **Windows** > **Threads**. You must be in a debugging session to open or see the **Threads** and other debugging windows.

## Examine thread markers

1. In the source code, locate the `Console.WriteLine();` line.

   1. Right-click in the **Threads** window, and select **Show Threads in Source** ![Show Threads in Source](../debugger/media/dbg-multithreaded-show-threads.png "ThreadMarker") from the menu.

   The gutter next to the source code line now displays a *thread marker* icon ![Thread Marker](../debugger/media/dbg-thread-marker.png "Thread Marker"). The thread marker indicates that a thread is stopped at this location. If there is more than one stopped thread at the location, the ![multiple threads](../debugger/media/dbg-multithreaded-show-threads.png "multiple threads") icon appears.

1. Hover the pointer over the thread marker. A DataTip appears, showing the name and thread ID number for the stopped thread or threads. The thread names may be `<No Name>`.

   >[!TIP]
   >To help identify nameless threads, you can rename them in the **Threads** window. Right-click the thread and select **Rename**.

1. Right-click the thread marker in the source code to see the available options on the shortcut menu.

## Flag and unflag threads

You can flag threads to keep track of threads you want to pay special attention to.

Flag and unflag threads from the source code editor or from the **Threads** window. Choose whether to display only flagged threads, or all threads, from the **Debug Location** or **Threads** window toolbars. Selections made from any location affect all locations.

### Flag and unflag threads in source code

1. Open the **Debug Location** toolbar by selecting **View** > **Toolbars** > **Debug Location**. You can also right-click in the toolbar area and select **Debug Location**.

1. The **Debug Location** toolbar has three fields: **Process**, **Thread**, and **Stack Frame**. Drop down the **Thread** list, and note how many threads there are. In the **Thread** list, the currently executing thread is marked by a **>** symbol.

1. In the source code window, hover over a thread marker icon in the gutter and select the flag icon (or one of the empty flag icons) in the DataTip. The flag icon turns red.

   You can also right-click a thread marker icon, point to **Flag**, and then select a thread to flag from the shortcut menu.

1. On the **Debug Location** toolbar, select the **Show Only Flagged Threads** icon ![Show Flagged Threads](../debugger/media/dbg-threads-show-flagged.png "Show Flagged Threads"), to the right of the **Thread** field. The icon is grayed out unless one or more threads are flagged.

   Only the flagged thread now appears in the **Thread** dropdown in the toolbar. To show all threads again, select the **Show Only Flagged Threads** icon again.

   >[!TIP]
   >After you have flagged some threads, you can place your cursor in the code editor, right-click, and select **Run Flagged Threads to Cursor**. Make sure to choose code that all flagged threads will reach. **Run Flagged Threads to Cursor** will pause threads on the selected line of code, making it easier to control the order of execution by [freezing and thawing threads](#bkmk_freeze).

1. To toggle the flagged or unflagged status of the currently executing thread, select the single flag **Toggle Current Thread Flagged State** toolbar button, to the left of the **Show Only Flagged Threads** button. Flagging the current thread is useful for locating the current thread when only flagged threads are showing.

1. To unflag a thread, hover over the thread marker in the source code and select the red flag icon to clear it, or right-click the thread marker and select **Unflag**.

### Flag and unflag threads in the Threads window

In the **Threads** window, flagged threads have red flag icons next to them, while unflagged threads, if shown, have empty icons.

![Threads Window](../debugger/media/dbg-threads-window.png "Threads Window")

Select a flag icon to change the thread state to flagged or unflagged, depending on its current state.

You can also right-click a line and select **Flag**, **Unflag**, or **Unflag All Threads** from the shortcut menu.

The **Threads** window toolbar also has a **Show Flagged Threads Only** button, which is the righthand one of the two flag icons. It works the same as the button on the **Debug Location** toolbar, and either button controls the display in both locations.

### Other Threads window features

In the **Threads** window, select the header of any column to sort the threads by that column. Select again to reverse the sort order. If all threads are showing, selecting the flag icon column sorts the threads by flagged or unflagged status.

The second column of the **Threads** window (with no header) is the **Current Thread** column. A yellow arrow in this column marks the current execution point.

The **Location** column shows where each thread appears in the source code. Select the expand arrow next to the **Location** entry, or hover over the entry, to show a partial call stack for that thread.

>[!TIP]
>For a graphical view of the call stacks for threads, use the [Parallel Stacks](../debugger/using-the-parallel-stacks-window.md) window. To open the window, while debugging, select **Debug**> **Windows** > **Parallel Stacks**.

In addition to **Flag**, **Unflag**, and **Unflag All Threads**, the right-click context menu for **Thread** window items has:

- The **Show Threads in Source** button.
- **Hexadecimal display**, which changes the **Thread ID**s in the **Threads** window from decimal to hexadecimal format.
- [Switch To Thread](#switch-to-another-thread), which immediately switches execution to that thread.
- **Rename**, which lets you change the thread name.
- [Freeze and Thaw](#bkmk_freeze) commands.

## <a name="bkmk_freeze"></a> Freeze and thaw thread execution

You can freeze and thaw, or suspend and resume, threads to control the order in which the threads perform work. Freezing and thawing threads can help you resolve concurrency issues, such as deadlocks and race conditions.

> [!TIP]
> To follow a single thread without freezing other threads, which is also a common debugging scenario, see [Get started debugging multithreaded applications](../debugger/get-started-debugging-multithreaded-apps.md#bkmk_follow_a_thread).

**To freeze and unfreeze threads:**

1. In the **Threads** window, right-click any thread and then select **Freeze**. A **Pause** icon in the **Current Thread** column indicates that the thread is frozen.

1. Select **Columns** in the **Threads** window toolbar, and then select **Suspended Count** to display the **Suspended Count** column. The suspended count value for the frozen thread is **1**.

1. Right-click the frozen thread and select **Thaw**.

   The **Pause** icon disappears, and the **Suspended Count** value changes to **0**.

## Switch to another thread

You may see a **The application is in break mode** window when you try to switch to another thread. This window tells you that the thread does not have any code that the current debugger can display. For example, you may be debugging managed code, but the thread is native code. The window offers suggestions for resolving the issue.

**To switch to another thread:**

1. In the **Threads** window, make a note of the current thread ID, which is the thread with a yellow arrow in the **Current Thread** column. You'll want to switch back to this thread to continue your app.

1. Right-click a different thread and select **Switch To Thread** from the context menu.

1. Observe that the yellow arrow location has changed in the **Threads** window. The original current thread marker also remains, as an outline.

   Look at the tooltip on the thread marker in the code source editor, and the list in the **Thread** dropdown on the **Debug Location** toolbar. Observe that the current thread has also changed there.

1. On the **Debug Location** toolbar, select a different thread from the **Thread** list. Note that the current thread changes in the other two locations also.

1. In the source code editor, right-click a thread marker, point to **Switch To Thread**, and select another thread from the list. Observe that the current thread changes in all three locations.

With the thread marker in source code, you can switch only to threads that are stopped at that location. By using the **Threads** window and **Debug Location** toolbar, you can switch to any thread.

You've now learned the basics of debugging multithreaded apps. You can observe, flag and unflag, and freeze and thaw threads by using the **Threads** window, the **Thread** list in the **Debug Location** toolbar, or thread markers in the source code editor.
