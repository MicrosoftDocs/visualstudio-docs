# Error: Unable to initiate DCOM communication
A DCOM error occurred when the local machine tried to communicate with the remote machine. This is caused by a firewall on the remote server or broken Windows authentication on the remote machine.

### To correct this error

- If the remote machine has Windows Firewall enabled, see [Remote Debugging](../debugger/remote-debugging.md) for instructions about how to configure the firewall for local debugging.

- To restore Windows authentication, try rebooting both machines. Examine event logs on local and remote machines for Kerberos errors and contact domain administrators for known problems.
