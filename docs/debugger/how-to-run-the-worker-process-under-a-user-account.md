# How to: Run the Worker Process Under a User Account
To set up your computer so that you can run the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] worker process (aspnet_wp.exe or w3wp.exe) under a user account, follow these steps.

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Starting with Windows Server 2008 R2, we recommend the use of the [ApplicationPoolIdentity](/iis/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities) as the identity for each application pool.

## Procedure

#### To run aspnet_wp.exe under a user account

1. Open the machine.config file, located on your computer in the CONFIG folder under the path where you installed the runtime.

2. Find the &lt;processModel&gt; section and change the user and password attributes to the name and password of the user account you want aspnet_wp.exe to run under.

3. Save the machine.config file.

4. On [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../debugger/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)], IIS 6.0 is installed by default. The corresponding worker process is w3wp.exe.To run in IIS 6.0 mode with aspnet_wp.exe as the worker process, you must follow these steps:

   1. Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools** and then choose **Internet Information Services**.

   2. In the **Internet Information Services** dialog box, right-click the **Web Sites** folder and choose **Properties**.

   3. In the **Web Sites Properties** dialog box, choose **Service**.

   4. Select **Run WWW service in IIS6.0 isolation mode**.

   5. Close the **Properties** dialog box and **Internet Services Manager**.

5. Open a Windows Command Prompt and reset the server by running:

   ```cmd
   iisreset
   ```

   — or —

   ```cmd
   net stop iisadmin /y
   net start w3svc
   ```

6. Locate the Temporary [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Files folder, which should be in the same path as the CONFIG folder. Right-click the Temporary [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Files folder and choose **Properties** on the shortcut menu.

7. In the **Temporary ASP.NET Files Properties** dialog box, click the **Security** tab.

8. Click **Advanced**.

9. In the **Advanced Security Settings for Temporary ASP.Net Files** dialog box, click **Add**.

    The **Select User, Computer, or Group dialog box** appears.

10. Type the user name in the **Enter the object name to select** box, and then click **OK**. The user name must follow this format: DomainName\UserName.

11. In the **Permission Entry for Temporary ASP.NET Files** dialog box, give the user **Full Control**, and then click **OK** to close the **Entry for Temporary ASP.NET Files** dialog box.

12. A **Security** dialog box will appear, and asks if you really want to change the permissions on a system folder. Click **Yes**.

13. Click **OK** to close the **Temporary ASP.NET Files Properties** dialog box.
