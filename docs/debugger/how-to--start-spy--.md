# How to: Start Spy++
You can start Spy++ either from Visual Studio or at a command prompt.  
  
 When you start Spy++, if a message is displayed to ask permission to make changes to the computer, click **Yes**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can run only one instance of Spy++. If you try to run another instance, it just causes the currently running instance to get the focus.  
  
### To start Spy++ from Visual Studio  
  
-   On the **Tools** menu, click **Spy++**.  
  
     Because Spy++ runs independently, after you start it, you can close Visual Studio.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you log messages with Spy++, it may cause the operating system to perform more slowly.  
  
### To start Spy++ at a command prompt  
  
1.  In a Command Prompt window, change directories to the folder that contains spyxx.exe. Typically, the path of this folder is ..\\*Visual Studio installation folder*\Common7\Tools\\.  
  
2.  Type **spyxx.exe** and then press ENTER.
