# How to: Display Window Properties
To find out more about a window listed in [Windows View](../debugger/windows-view.md), use the [Window Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/window-properties-dialog-box.md).

### To open the Window Properties dialog box

1. Select the item, then choose **Properties** from the **View** menu.

   Properties dialog boxes are not modal. As you click from item to item in a view window, the dialog box is automatically refreshed with information on each item selected.
