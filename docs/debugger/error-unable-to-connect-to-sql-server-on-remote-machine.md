# Error: Unable to connect to SQL Server on remote machine
Unable to connect to SQL Server on remote machine *name*. Access denied. Verify that you have installed the remote debugger on the remote machine. If the remote machine is not on a domain, or if Visual Studio is running as a local account, the remote machine must have an account with the same user name and password as the local account.

### To correct this error
