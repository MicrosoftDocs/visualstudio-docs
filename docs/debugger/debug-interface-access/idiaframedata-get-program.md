# IDiaFrameData::get_program
Retrieves the program string that is used to compute the register set before the call to the current function.

## Syntax

```C++
HRESULT get_program (Â 
   BSTR* pRetVal
);
```

#### Parameters
 `pRetVal`

[out] Returns the program string.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`. Returns `S_FALSE` if this property is not supported. Otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 The program string is a sequence of macros that is interpreted in order to establish the prologue. For example, a typical stack frame might use the program string `"$T0 $ebp = $eip $T0 4 + ^ = $ebp $T0 ^ = $esp $T0 8 + ="`. The format is reverse polish notation, where the operators follow the operands. `T0` represents a temporary variable on the stack. This example performs the following steps:

1. Move contents of register `ebp` to `T0`.

2. Add `4` to the value in `T0` to produce an address, get the value from that address, and store the value in register `eip`.

3. Get the value from the address stored in `T0` and store that value in register `ebp`.

4. Add `8` to the value in `T0` and store that value in register `esp`.

   Note that the program string is specific to the CPU and to the calling convention set up for the function represented by the current stack frame.
