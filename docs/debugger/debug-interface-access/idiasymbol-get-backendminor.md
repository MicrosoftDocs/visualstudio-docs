# IDiaSymbol::get_backEndMinor
Retrieves the back end minor version number of the compiler.

## Syntax

```C++
HRESULT get_backEndMinor (Â 
   DWORD* pRetVal
);
```

#### Parameters
 `pRetVal`

[out] Returns the back end minor version number. See Remarks.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns `S_FALSE` or an error code.

> [!NOTE]
> A return value of `S_FALSE` means that the property is not available for the symbol.

## Remarks
 A compiler is typically composed of two primary elements: the front end (the parser), which handles parsing the source code into an intermediate form, and a back end (code generator), which converts the intermediate form into assembly. It is not uncommon for the front end to have a different version than the back end.

 A front end or back end version number is composed of three parts: \<major>.\<minor>.\<build>, where \<major> is the major version number, \<minor> is the minor version number, and \<build> is the build number. For example, 13.10.3077.
