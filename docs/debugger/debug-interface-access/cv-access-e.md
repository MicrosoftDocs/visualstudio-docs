# CV_access_e
Specifies the scope of visibility (access level) of member functions and variables.

## Syntax

```C++
typedef enum CV_access_e {
    CV_private   = 1,
    CV_protected = 2,
    CV_public    = 3
} CV_access_e;
```

## Elements
CV_private
Member has private access.

CV_protected
Member has protected access.

CV_public
Member has public access.

## Remarks
The `friend` access specifier is not included here because it is typically used by non-member functions that have access to both private and protected elements of the class. Use the [IDiaSymbol::get_symTag](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiasymbol-get-symtag.md) method to find symbols with `SymTagFriend` access.

## Requirements
Header: cvconst.h
