# DiaAddressMapEntry
Describes an entry in an address map.

## Syntax

```C++
struct DiaAddressMapEntry {
    DWORD rva,
    DWORD rvaTo
};
```

## Elements
`rva`
A relative virtual address (RVA) in image A.

`rvaTo`
The relative virtual address `rva` is mapped to in image B.

## Remarks
An address map provides a translation from one image layout (A) to another (B). An array of `DiaAddressMapEntry` structures sorted by `rva` defines an address map.

To translate an address, `addrA`, in image A to an address, `addrB`, in image B, perform the following steps:

1. Search the map for the entry, `e`, with the largest `rva` less than or equal to `addrA`.

2. Set `delta = addrA - e.rva`.

3. Set `addrB = e.rvaTo + delta`.

    An array of `DiaAddressMapEntry` structures is passed to the [IDiaAddressMap::set_addressMap](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiaaddressmap-set-addressmap.md) method.
