# IDiaAddressMap::put_addressMapEnabled
Specifies whether the address map should be used to translate symbol addresses.

## Syntax

```C++
HRESULT put_addressMapEnabled (Â 
   BOOL NewVal
);
```

#### Parameters
 NewVal

[in] Set to `TRUE` to enable the translation of symbols, or `FALSE` to disable.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 Executable post-processors sometimes update the executable. DIA contains a mechanism to support the translation of symbols to the new layout.

 When a PDB file is loaded, the address map stored in the file is enabled. There are times, however, when a client application may need to supply its own address map by calling the [IDiaAddressMap::set_addressMap](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiaaddressmap-set-addressmap.md) method. If the `set_addressMap` method is successful, the client application must call the `put_addressMapEnabled` method with a `NewVal` parameter of `TRUE` to enable the use of that address map.

 The current state of the address map being enabled can be retrieved with a call to the [IDiaAddressMap::get_addressMapEnabled](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiaaddressmap-get-addressmapenabled.md) method.
