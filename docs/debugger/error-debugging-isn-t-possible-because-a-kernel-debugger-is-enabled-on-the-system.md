# Error: Debugging Isn&#39;t Possible Because a Kernel Debugger is Enabled on the System
When you debug managed code, you might receive the following error message:

```cmd
Debugging isn't possible because a kernel debugger is enabled on the system
```

 This message occurs when you try to debug managed code:

- on a [!INCLUDE[win7](../debugger/includes/win7_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../debugger/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)]system that has been started in debug mode.

- the application uses the CLR version CLR 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5.

## Solution

#### To fix this problem

- Upgrade your application to use CLR version 4.0 or 4.5

   —or—

- Disable kernel debugging and debug in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

   —or—

- Debug using the Kernel Debugger instead of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

   —or—

- In the Kernel Debugger, disable user-mode exceptions.

#### To disable kernel debugging in the current session

- At the command prompt, type:

    ```cmd
    Kdbgctrl.exe -d
    ```

#### To disable kernel debugging for all sessions (Windows Vista and Windows 7)

1. At the command prompt, type:

    ```cmd
    bcdedit /debug off
    ```

2. Restart the computer.

#### To disable kernel debugging for all sessions (other Windows operating systems)

1. Locate boot.ini on your system drive (usually C:\\). The boot.ini file might be hidden and read-only. Therefore, you must use the following command to see it:

    ```cmd
    dir /ASH
    ```

2. Open boot.ini using Notepad and remove the following options:

    ```cmd
    /debug
    /debugport
    /baudrate
    ```

3. Restart the computer.

#### To debug with the Kernel Debugger

1. If the Kernel Debugger is hooked up, you will see a message that asks whether you want to continue to debug. Click the button to continue.

2. You might get a `User break exception(Int 3).` If this occurs, type the following Kernel Debugger command to continue to debug:

     `gn`
