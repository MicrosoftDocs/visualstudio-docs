# View snapshots with IntelliTrace step-back (Visual Studio Enterprise) (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

**IntelliTrace step-back** automatically takes a snapshot of your application at every breakpoint and debugger step event. The recorded snapshots enable you to go back to previous breakpoints or steps and view the state of the application as it was in the past. IntelliTrace step-back can save you time when you want to see the previous application state but don't want to restart debugging or recreate the desired app state.

You can navigate and view snapshots by using the **Step Backward** and **Step Forward** buttons in the Debug toolbar. These buttons navigate the events that appear in the **Events** tab in the **Diagnostic Tools** window.
