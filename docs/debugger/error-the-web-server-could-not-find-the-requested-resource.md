# Error: The Web Server Could Not Find the Requested Resource
Due to security considerations, IIS has returned a generic error.

One possible cause is the security configuration of the server. IIS 6.0 and earlier versions used an add-on program, known as URLScan, to filter out suspicious and malformed requests. IIS 7.0 has built-in Request Filtering for the same purpose. In both cases, overly restrictive request filtering can prevent Visual Studio from debugging the server.

Another possible cause of this error is that the W3SVC service for IIS is not started. Check that this service is started (grayed out) in the Services window (*services.msc*).

There are numerous additional possible causes of this error. A few of the most common causes include a problem with the IIS installation or configuration, the web site configuration, or permissions in the file system. You can try accessing the resource with a browser. Depending on how IIS is configured, you might have to use a local browser on the server or inspect the IIS error log to get a detailed error message.

 For more information on troubleshooting IIS, see [IIS Management and Administration](/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/iis-management-and-administration).
