# Create custom views of data in the Visual Studio debugger (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger provides many tools for inspecting and modifying the state of your program. Most of these tools function only in break mode.

## Create custom views of data in variable windows and DataTips

 Many of the [debugger windows](../debugger/debugger-windows.md), such as the **Autos** and **Watch** windows, allow you to inspect variables. You can customize how C++ types, managed objects, and your own types are shown in the debugger variable windows and in [DataTips](../debugger/view-data-values-in-data-tips-in-the-code-editor.md). For more information, see [Create custom views of C++ objects](../debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects.md) and [Create custom views of managed objects](../debugger/create-custom-views-of-managed-objects.md).

## Create custom visualizers

 Visualizers enable you to view the contents of an object or variable in a meaningful way. In the Visual Studio debugger, a visualizer refers to the different windows that you can open using the magnifying glass ![VisualizerIcon](../debugger/media/dbg-tips-visualizer-icon.png "Visualizer icon") icon. For example, the HTML visualizer shows how an HTML string would be interpreted and displayed in a browser. You can access visualizers from DataTips, the **Watch** window, the **Autos** window, and the **Locals** window. The **QuickWatch** dialog box also provides a visualizer. For more information, see [Create custom visualizers](../debugger/create-custom-visualizers-of-data.md).
