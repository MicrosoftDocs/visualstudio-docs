# Protected mode for dump debugging

When debugging dump files from untrusted sources, Visual Studio by default enables protected mode to provide a secure debugging environment.

## What is protected mode?

Protected mode isolates the debugger process from the rest of the system using AppContainer isolation. This isolation helps prevent malicious code or data within the dump file from affecting your system or accessing sensitive information.

## Limitations

* The **Tasks** view will be empty in the Parallel Stacks window
* The debugger **Tasks** window (**Debug->Windows->Tasks**) will be empty
* Protected mode isn't enabled for Diagnostic Analysis and Debug Managed Memory

## Disable protected mode

Protected mode can be disabled for a dump temporarily by unselecting the **Protected** toggle on the dump summary page, or permanently for the dump by marking it as trusted using the **Trust** button.
