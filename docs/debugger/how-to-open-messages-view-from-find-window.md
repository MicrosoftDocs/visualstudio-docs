# How to: Open Messages View from Find Window
You might find it convenient to use the **Find Window** dialog box to select a target window, and then open a Messages view of that window.

### To open a Messages view window using the Find Window dialog box

1. Arrange your windows so that both Spy++ and the target window are visible.

2. From the **Spy** menu, choose **Find Window**.

    The [Find Window Dialog Box](../debugger/find-window-dialog-box.md) opens.

3. From the **Windows** tab, drag the **Finder Tool** over the target window. As you drag the tool, the **Find Window** dialog box displays details on the selected window.

     If you have the handle of the window you want to examine (for example, copied from the debugger), you can type it into the **Handle** text box.

4. Under **Show**, select **Messages**.

5. Press **OK**.

    A blank [Messages View](../debugger/messages-view.md) window opens, and a **Messages** menu is added to the Spy++ toolbar.

6. From the **Messages** menu, choose **Logging Options**.

    The [Message Options Dialog Box](../debugger/message-options-dialog-box.md) opens.

7. Select the options for the messages you want to display.

8. Press **OK** to begin logging messages.

    Depending upon the options selected, messages begin streaming into the active Messages view window.

9. When you have enough messages, choose **Stop Logging** from the **Messages** menu.
