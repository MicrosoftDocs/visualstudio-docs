The Visual Studio debugger provides complete support for debugging UWP apps. See the following articles for UWP debug tasks.

|Debug task|Article|
|-|-|
|Run UWP apps on a local machine, remote or connected device, or app simulator.|[Start a debugging session for a UWP app](../debugger/start-a-debugging-session-for-a-store-app-in-visual-studio-vb-csharp-cpp-and-xaml.md)|
|Debug deployed apps, both local and remote.|[Debug an installed app package](../debugger/debug-installed-app-package.md)|
| [Write and debug running XAML code](../xaml-tools/xaml-hot-reload.md) | You can use XAML Hot Reload to explore the visual tree of a UWP XAML object and view the dependency properties for the objects in that tree. This topic describes how to use XAML Hot Reload. |
| [Inspect XAML properties while debugging](../xaml-tools/xaml-hot-reload.md) | You can use the Live Visual Tree to explore the visual tree of a UWP XAML object and view the dependency properties for the objects in that tree. |
|Analyze the effect of the ContentPrefetcher class on UWP apps.|[Prefetch content for UWP apps](../debugger/prefetch-content-for-windows-store-apps.md)|
