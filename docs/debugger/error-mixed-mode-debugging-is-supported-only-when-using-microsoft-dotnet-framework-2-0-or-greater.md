# Error: Mixed mode debugging is supported only when using Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or greater
To debug mixed native and managed code, you must have .NET Framework version 2.0, 3.0. 3.5, or 4.0. Mixed-mode debugging with earlier versions of the .NET Framework is not supported.

### To correct this error

- Upgrade the .NET Framework to version 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0.
