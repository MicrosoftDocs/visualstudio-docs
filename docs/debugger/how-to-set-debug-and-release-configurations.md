# How to: Set debug and release configurations in Visual Studio
Visual Studio projects have separate release and debug configurations for your program. As the names imply, you build the debug version for debugging and the release version for the final release distribution.  
  
The debug configuration of your program is compiled with full symbolic debug information and no optimization. Optimization complicates debugging, because the relationship between source code and generated instructions is more complex.  
  
The release configuration of your program contains no symbolic debug information and is fully optimized. Debug information can be generated in .pdb files, [depending on the compiler options](#BKMK_symbols_release) that are used. Creating .pdb files can be very useful if you later have to debug your release version.  
  
For more information about build configurations, see [Understanding Build Configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md).  
  
You can change the build configuration from the **Build** menu, from the toolbar, or in the project's property pages. Project property pages are language-specific. The procedure below shows how to change the build configuration from the menu and the toolbar. For more information about how to change the build configuration in projects in different languages, see the See Also section below.  
  
## Change the build configuration  
  
1.  From the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manager**, then select **Debug** or **Release**.  
  
2.  On the toolbar, choose either **Debug** or **Release** from the **Solution Configurations** list box.  
  
     ![toolbar build configuration](../debugger/media/toolbarbuildconfiguration.png "ToolbarBuildConfiguration")  
  
     This toolbar is not available in Express editions. You can use the **Build Solution F6** and **Start Debugging F5** menu items to choose the configuration.

## <a name="BKMK_symbols_release"></a>Generate symbol (.pbd) files for a build

For most project types, the .pdb files are generated by default for both debug and release builds, but the default settings are different depending on your specific project type and the version of Visual Studio. You can configure whether the compiler generates .pdb files and what kind of debug information to include.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The debugger will load only a .pdb file for an executable file that exactly matches the .pdb file that was created when the executable was built (that is, the .pdb must be the original or a copy of the original .pdb file). For more information see [Why does Visual Studio require debugger symbol files to exactly match the binary files that they were built with?](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jimgries/2007/07/06/why-does-visual-studio-require-debugger-symbol-files-to-exactly-match-the-binary-files-that-they-were-built-with/)

Each project type may have a different way of setting these options.

### Generate symbol files for a C#, ASP.NET, or Visual Basic project

For detailed information on project settings for debug configurations in C#, see [Project settings for a C# Debug configuration](../debugger/project-settings-for-csharp-debug-configurations.md). For Visual Basic, see [this topic](../debugger/project-settings-for-a-visual-basic-debug-configuration.md).

1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**.

2. Choose a **Release** or **Debug** build from the **Configuration** list.

2. Choose **Build** settings and then click the **Advanced** button.

    In Visual Basic, you choose the **Compile** settings and the **Advanced Compile Options** button instead.

3. Choose **full**, **portable**, or **pdb_only** in the **Debugging information** list box (**Generate debug info** in Visual Basic).

    The portable format is the most recent cross-platform format for .NET Core. For more information on options, see [Advanced Build Settings dialog box (C#)](../ide/reference/advanced-build-settings-dialog-box-csharp.md).

4. Build your project.

    The symbol file(s) get created in the same folder as the executable or the main output file.

### Generate symbol files for a C++ project

1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**.

2. Choose a **Release** or **Debug** build from the **Configuration** list.

2. Under **Linker > Debugging**, select desired options for **Generate Debug Info**.

    For detailed information on project settings for debug configurations in C++, see [Project settings for a C++ Debug configuration](../debugger/project-settings-for-a-cpp-debug-configuration.md).

4. Configure options for Generate Program Database Files

    In most C++ projects, the default value is `$(OutDir)$(TargetName).pdb`, which generates .pdb files in the output folder.

5. Build your project.

    The symbol file(s) get created in the same folder as the executable or the main output file.
