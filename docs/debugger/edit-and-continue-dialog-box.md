# Edit and Continue Dialog Box

(Native Only) This dialog box appears when you have edited code while debugging and **Edit and Continue** recognizes that it can apply code changes. For more information, see [Edit and Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-enable-and-disable-edit-and-continue).

 **Never show me this dialog again**
 If you select this check box, **Edit and Continue** will apply code changes without asking permission in the future. You can turn this warning on again by going to the **Options** dialog box, opening the **Debugging** Folder, clicking the **Edit and Continue** page, and selecting **Invoked by debug commands** and **Ask me first**.
