# How to: Expand and Collapse Spy++ Trees
You can expand and collapse the Windows, Processes, and Threads views using two methods: by clicking on the icons in the window or by using the **Tree** menu. The + and - icons in the tree act as they do in the C++ project window.

 The **Tree** menu contains four commands:

|Menu Command|Description|
|------------------|-----------------|
|**Expand One Level**|Expands the currently selected item to the next level.|
|**Expand Branch**|Fully expands the currently selected item.|
|**Expand All**|Fully expands all items in the window.|
|**Collapse**|Fully collapses the currently selected item.|

> [!TIP]
> If you expand a process, you see all the threads the process owns. If you expand a thread, you see a list of all the windows it owns.

### To expand or collapse Spy++ trees

1. Highlight one of the items in the Windows, Processes, or Threads view.

2. From the **Tree** menu, choose one of the expand or collapse commands.
