# How to: Expand and Collapse Spy++ Trees
You can expand and collapse the Windows, Processes, and Threads views using two methods: by clicking on the icons in the window or by using the **Tree** menu. The + and – icons in the tree act as they do in the Visual C++ project window.  
  
 The **Tree** menu contains four commands:  
  
|Menu Command|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**Expand One Level**|Expands the currently selected item to the next level.|  
|**Expand Branch**|Fully expands the currently selected item.|  
|**Expand All**|Fully expands all items in the window.|  
|**Collapse**|Fully collapses the currently selected item.|  
  
> [!TIP]
>  If you expand a process, you see all the threads the process owns. If you expand a thread, you see a list of all the windows it owns.  
  
### To expand or collapse Spy++ trees  
  
1.  Highlight one of the items in the Windows, Processes, or Threads view.  
  
2.  From the **Tree** menu, choose one of the expand or collapse commands.
