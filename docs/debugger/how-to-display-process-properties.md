# How to: Display Process Properties
To find out more about a process listed in [Processes View](../debugger/processes-view.md), use the [Process Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/process-properties-dialog-box.md).

### To open a Process Properties dialog box

1. Select a process from the tree displayed in **Processes view**.

2. From the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.

   Properties dialog boxes are not modal, so you can click on another item in a view window and the dialog box will show information on the selected item.
