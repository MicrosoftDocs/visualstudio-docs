# Debug Registers

The architecture (platform configuration) that your program runs on has a limited number of hardware data breakpoints it can use. The table below indicates how many registers are available to use per architecture.

| Architecture | Number of Hardware Supported Data Breakpoints | Max Byte Size|
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-------------:|
| x86 | 4 | 4 |
| x64 | 4 | 8 |
| ARM | 1 | 4 |
| ARM64 | 2 | 8 |
