# Error: Mixed-mode debugging for x64 processes is supported only when using Microsoft .NET Framework 4 or greater
To debug mixed native and managed code in a 64-bit process, you must have .NET Framework version 4. Mixed-mode debugging of 64-bit processes with .NET Framework versions earlier than 4 is not supported.

### To correct this error

- Perform one of the following steps:

  - Upgrade your .NET Framework to version 4.

  - Build a 32-bit version of your application for debugging.
