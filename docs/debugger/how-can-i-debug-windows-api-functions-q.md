# How Can I Debug Windows API Functions?
If you want to debug a Windows API function that has NT symbols loaded, you must do the following.

### To set a breakpoint on a Windows API function with NT symbols loaded

- In the [function breakpoint](../debugger/using-breakpoints.md#BKMK_Set_a_breakpoint_in_a_source_file), enter the function name together with the name of the DLL where the function resides (see the [context operator](../debugger/context-operator-cpp.md)). In 32-bit code, use the decorated form of the function name. To set a breakpoint on **MessageBeep**, for example, you must enter the following.

    ```cpp
    {,,USER32.DLL}_MessageBeep@4
    ```

     To obtain the decorated name, see [Viewing Decorated Names](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f79e2717-a4db-4d12-a689-69830cce2be0).

     You can test the decorated name and view it in disassembly code. While paused at the function in the Visual Studio debugger, right-click the function in the code editor or call stack window and choose **Go to Disassembly**.

- In 64-bit code, you can use the undecorated name.

    ```cpp
    {,,USER32.DLL}MessageBeep
    ```
