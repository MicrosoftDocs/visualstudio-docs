# Report Hook Functions
A report hook function, installed using [_CrtSetReportHook](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtsetreporthook), is called every time [_CrtDbgReport](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtdbgreport-crtdbgreportw) generates a debug report. You can use it, among other things, for filtering reports to focus on specific types of allocations. A report hook function should have a prototype like the following:  
  
```  
int YourReportHook(int nRptType, char *szMsg, int *retVal);  
```  
  
 The pointer that you pass to **_CrtSetReportHook** is of type **_CRT_REPORT_HOOK**, as defined in CRTDBG.H:  
  
```  
typedef int (__cdecl *_CRT_REPORT_HOOK)(int, char *, int *);  
```  
  
 When the run-time library calls your hook function, the *nRptType* argument contains the category of the report (**_CRT_WARN**, **_CRT_ERROR**, or **_CRT_ASSERT**), *szMsg* contains a pointer to a fully assembled report message string, and *retVal* specifies whether `_CrtDbgReport` should continue normal execution after generating the report or start the debugger. (A *retVal* value of zero continues execution, a value of 1 starts the debugger.)  
  
 If the hook handles the message in question completely, so that no further reporting is required, it should return **TRUE**. If it returns **FALSE**, `_CrtDbgReport` will report the message normally.
