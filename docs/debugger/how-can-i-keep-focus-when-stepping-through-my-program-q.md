# How Can I Keep Focus When Stepping Through My App?
## Description
 My program has a window-activation problem. Stepping through the program with the debugger interferes with my ability to reproduce the problem because my program keeps losing focus. Is there any way to avoid this?

## Solution
 If you have a second computer, use remote debugging. You can operate your program on the remote computer while you run the debugger on the host. For more information, see [How to: Select a Remote Computer](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/w8wtw2f3(v=vs.100)).
