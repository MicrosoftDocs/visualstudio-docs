# Error: ASP.NET Not Installed
This error occurs when [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] is not installed correctly on the computer that you are trying to debug. This might mean that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] was never installed or that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] was installed first and IIS was installed later.

### To reinstall ASP.NET

1. From a command prompt window, run the following command:

   ```cmd
   \WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version\aspnet_regiis -i
   ```

    where *version* represents the version number of the .NET Framework installed on your computer, such as v1.0.370. You can determine the framework version by looking in the `\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework` directory.

   > [!NOTE]
   > With Windows Server 2003, you can install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] by using **Add or Remove Programs** in Control Panel.
