# Select Code Type Dialog Box

To open this dialog box, open the **Attach to Process** dialog box, and then click the **Select** button.

**Automatically determine the type of code to debug**
The appropriate debugger will be selected based on the kind of code that is running.

**Debug these code types:**
From the list provided, choose the type(s) of code you want to debug. This can be helpful when [troubleshooting a failure to attach](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md#BKMK_Troubleshoot_attach_errors). This option restricts detection to only those types of code you want to debug.

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"
   - Blazor WebAssembly - Client-side Blazor WebAssembly
   - GPU - Software Emulator - C++ code running on a GPU software emulator
   - JavaScript (Chrome) - JavaScript running in Chrome
   - JavaScript (Microsoft Edge - Chromium) - JavaScript running in Chromium-based Microsoft Edge for Windows 10
   - JavaScript CDP (V3) Debugger - Chrome DevTools Protocol version 3, used for debugging in a CDP client
   - Managed (CoreCLR) - .NET Core
   - Managed (Native compilation) - C++/CLR code
   - Managed (v3.5, v3.0, v2.0) - .NET Framework code for .NET Framework 2.0 and higher (up to 3.5)
   - Managed (v.4.6, v4.5, v4.0) - .NET Framework code for .NET Framework 4.0 and higher
   - Native - C/C++
   - Node.js Debugging - Code hosted by the Node.js runtime
   - Python - Python 
   - Script - Specifies the general script debugger for JavaScript. Use more restrictive options if they apply to your scenario, such as JavaScript (Chrome).
   - T-SQL - Transact-SQL
   - Unity - Unity
   - Managed Compatibility Mode - Specifies the legacy debugger for managed code, for use typically in mixed-mode debugging with C++/CLR code (enables Edit and Continue for mixed mode) or to support extensions that targeted the legacy debugger. In most mixed-mode debugging scenarios, select **Native** and the appropriate **Managed** code types instead of Managed Compatibility Mode.
   ::: moniker-end

   For most scenarios, attaching multiple debuggers in the same debugging session is not supported. You may be able to do this using a second instance of Visual Studio.
