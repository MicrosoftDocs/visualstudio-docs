# Introducing Spy++
Spy++ lets you perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Display a graphical tree of relationships among system objects. These include [processes](../debugger/processes-view.md), [threads](../debugger/threads-view.md), and [windows](../debugger/windows-view.md).  
  
-   Search for specified [windows](../debugger/how-to-search-for-a-window-in-windows-view.md), [threads](../debugger/how-to-search-for-a-thread-in-threads-view.md), [processes](../debugger/how-to-search-for-a-process-in-processes-view.md), or [messages](../debugger/how-to-search-for-a-message-in-messages-view.md).  
  
-   View the properties of selected [windows](../debugger/how-to-display-window-properties.md), [threads](../debugger/how-to-display-thread-properties.md), [processes](../debugger/how-to-display-process-properties.md), or [messages](../debugger/how-to-display-message-properties.md).  
  
-   Select a window, thread, process, or message directly in the view.  
  
-   Use the [Finder Tool](../debugger/how-to-use-the-finder-tool.md) to select a window by mouse pointer positioning.  
  
-   Set [message option](../debugger/how-to-open-messages-view-from-find-window.md) by using complex message log selection parameters.  
  
 Spy++ has a toolbar and hyperlinks to help you work faster. It also provides a **Refresh** command to update the active view, a **Window Finder Tool** to make spying easier, and a **Font** dialog box to customize view windows. Additionally, Spy++ lets you save and restore user preferences.  
  
 In various Spy++ windows, you can right-click to display a shortcut menu of frequently used commands. Which commands are displayed depends on where the pointer is. For example, if you right-click an entry in the Window view and the selected window is visible, then clicking **Highlight** on the shortcut menu causes the border of the selected window to flash so that it can be located more easily.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  There are two other utilities that resemble Spy++: PView, which shows details about processes and threads, and DDESPY.EXE, which lets you monitor Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) messages.  
  
## 64-Bit Operating Systems  
 There are two versions of Spy++. The first version, named Spy++ (spyxx.exe), is designed to display messages sent to a window that is running in a 32-bit process. For example, Visual Studio runs in a 32-bit process. Therefore, you can use Spy++ to display messages sent to **Solution Explorer**. Because the default configuration for most builds in Visual Studio is to run in a 32-bit process, this first version of Spy++ is the one that is [available on the **Tools** menu](../debugger/how-to-start-spy-increment.md) in Visual Studio.  
  
 The second version, named Spy++ (64-bit) (spyxx_amd64.exe), is designed to display messages sent to a window that is running in a 64-bit process. For example, on a 64-bit operating system, Notepad runs in a 64-bit process. Therefore, you can use Spy++ (64-bit) to display messages sent to Notepad. Spy++ (64-bit) is typically located in  
  
 ..\\*Visual Studio installation folder*\Common7\Tools\spyxx_amd64.exe.  
  
 You can run either version of Spy++ directly from the command line.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Although the Spy++ (64-bit) file name contains "amd", it runs on any x64 Windows operating system.
