# How to: Use Native Run-Time Checks
In a Visual Studio C++ project, you can use native [runtime_checks](/cpp/preprocessor/runtime-checks) to catch common run-time errors such as:

- Stack pointer corruption.

- Overruns of local arrays.

- Stack corruption.

- Dependencies on uninitialized local variables.

- Loss of data on an assignment to a shorter variable.

  If you use **/RTC** with an optimized (**/O**) build, a compiler error results. If you use a `runtime_checks` pragma in an optimized build, the pragma has no effect.

  When you debug a program that has run-time checks enabled, the default action is for the program to stop and break to the debugger when a run-time error occurs. You can change this default behavior for any run-time check. For more information, see [Managing Exceptions with the Debugger](../debugger/managing-exceptions-with-the-debugger.md).

  The following procedures describe how to enable native run-time checks in a debug build, and how to modify native run-time check behavior.

  Other topics in this section provide information about:

- [Customizing Run-Time Checks with the C Run-Time Library](../debugger/native-run-time-checks-customization.md)

- [Using Run-Time Checks without the C Run-Time Library](../debugger/using-run-time-checks-without-the-c-run-time-library.md)

### To enable native run-time checks in a debug build

- Use the **/RTC** option and link with the debug version of a C run-time library (/MDd, for example).

### To modify native run-time check behavior

- Use the `runtime_checks` pragma.
