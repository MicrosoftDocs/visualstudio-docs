# Error: The Visual Studio Remote Debugger service on the target computer cannot connect back to this computer
This error means that the remote debugger service is running under a user account that cannot authenticate when it tries to connect to the computer that you are debugging from. This error may occur when remote debugging using the legacy debugging engine, and the remote debugger is running as a service.

 The following table shows what accounts can access the computer:

|Scenario|LocalSystem account|Domain account|Local accounts that have the same username and password on both computers|
|-|-|-|-|
|Both computers on the same domain|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Both computers on domains that have two-way trust|No|No|Yes|
|One or both computers on a workgroup|No|No|Yes|
|Computers on different domains|No|No|Yes|

 In addition:

- The account you run the Visual Studio Remote Debugger service under should be an administrator on the remote computer so that it can debug any process.

- The account also has to be granted the `Log on as a service` privilege on the remote computer that is using the **Local Security Policy** administrative tool.

- If you are using a local account access the computer, you must run the Visual Studio Remote Debugger service under a local account.

### To correct this error

1. Make sure the Visual Studio Remote Debugger service is correctly set up on the remote computer. For more information, see [Remote Debugging](../debugger/remote-debugging.md).

2. Run the remote debugger service under an account that can access the debugger host computer, as shown in the previous table.

### To add "Log on as a service" privilege

1. On the **Start** menu, choose **Control Panel**.

2. In Control Panel, choose **Classic View**, if necessary.

3. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.

4. In the Administrative Tools window, double-click **Local Security Policy**.

5. In the **Local Security Settings** window, expand the **Local Policies** folder.

6. Click **User Rights Assignment**.

7. In the **Policy** column, double-click **Log on as a service** to view current local Group Policy assignments in the **Log on as a service** dialog box.

8. To add new users, click the **Add User or Group** button.

9. When you are finished adding users, click **OK**.

### To work around this error

- Run the Remote Debugging Monitor as an application instead of a service.
