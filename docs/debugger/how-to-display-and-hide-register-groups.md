# How to: Display and Hide Register Groups (C#, C++, Visual Basic, F#)

The **Registers** window is available only if address-level debugging is enabled in the **Options** dialog box, **Debugging** node, **General** category.

To reduce clutter, the **Registers** window organizes registers into groups. If you right-click the **Registers** window, you will see a shortcut menu containing these groups, which you can display or hide as you see fit following the procedure below.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../ide/environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## Display or hide register groups

1. Right-click the **Registers** window.

2. On the shortcut menu, select the register groups you want to show or hide.

     Register groups that are not supported by the hardware you are debugging on are disabled on the shortcut menu, so they cannot be selected.
