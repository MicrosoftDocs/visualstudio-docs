# How to: Apply Edits in Break Mode with Edit and Continue (Visual Basic)
You can use Edit and Continue to edit your code in Break mode, and then continue without stopping and restarting execution.

For limitations on using Edit and Continue while debugging, see [Supported Code Changes (C# and Visual Basic)](../debugger/supported-code-changes-csharp.md).

### To edit code in Break mode

1. Enter Break mode by doing one of the following:

    - Set a breakpoint in your code, then choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu and wait for the application to hit the breakpoint.

         -or-

    - Start debugging, and then select **Break All** from the **Debug** menu.

         -or-

    - When an exception occurs, choose **Enable Editing** on the **Exception Assistant**.

2. Make any desired and supported code changes.

     For more information, see [Supported Code Changes (C# and Visual Basic)](../debugger/supported-code-changes-csharp.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you attempt to make a code change that is not allowed by Edit and Continue, your edit will be underlined by a purple wavy line and a task will appear in the Task List. You will not be able to continue code execution unless you undo the illegal code change.

3. On the **Debug** menu, click **Continue** to resume execution.

     Your code now executes with your applied edits incorporated into the project.
