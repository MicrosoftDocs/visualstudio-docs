# How to: Verify IIS Property Settings

You can set the properties for a Web application using the IIS administration tool. These properties must be set correctly for the application to run, so verifying these settings is often a necessary step in troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../ide/environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## To check IIS settings for the Web application

1. Open the **Administrative Tools** window: On the **Start** menu, point to **Programs**, and then click **Administrative Tools**. If **Administrative Tools** does not appear in the **Programs** menu, then look for it in the **Control Panel**.

   - On Windows 2000, select **Internet Services Manager**.

   - On Windows XP, select **Internet Information Services**.

   - On Windows Server 2003, double-click **Manage Your Server**.

        The **Manage Your Server** window opens. Under **Application Server**, click **Manage this application server**.

        The **Application Server** window opens. Open the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** node in the left pane.

2. In the dialog box, click the tree control node for your machine. Click the **Web Sites** node, and select the Web application's node. It will either be a Web site node, and thus a sibling of the **Default Web Site** node, or a virtual directory node underneath an existing Web site node.

3. Right-click the Web application, and on the shortcut menu, click **Properties**.

4. Verify the security settings for the Web application:

   1. In the Web application **Properties** window, click the **Directory Security** tab, and click **Edit**.

   2. In the **Authentication Methods** dialog box, select **Enable Anonymous Access** and **Integrated Windows authentication** if they are not already selected.

   3. Click **OK** to close the **Authentication Methods** dialog box.

5. For an ATL Server application, verify that the DEBUG verb is associated with your ISAPI extension. For more information, see [How to: Associate DEBUG Verb with Extension](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/50d261d3-4bd4-41c0-b44e-3591086f121e).

6. For an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application, make sure the virtual folder for the application has an Application Name set in **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**, **Internet Services Manager** or **Internet Information Services**.

   1. In the Web application **Properties** window, select the **Directory** tab, if the application is in a virtual directory, or the **Home Directory** tab, if the application is in a Web site.

   2. Verify that the name in the **Local path** matches the name of the directory where the application was actually deployed.

   3. Under **Application Settings**, type the name of the root directory that contains the application.

   4. Click **OK** to close the **Properties** dialog box.

7. For an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application, click the **ASP.NET** tab and verify that the correct version of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../code-quality/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] is specified.

8. Click **OK** to close the **Properties** dialog box.

9. Click **OK** to close the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**, **Internet Services Manager**, or **Internet Information Services** dialog box.
