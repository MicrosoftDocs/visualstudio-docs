# Debug Hook Function Writing
This section describes a number of custom debug hook functions you can write that allow you to insert your code into some predefined points inside the debugger's normal processing.

## In This Section
 [Client Block Hook Functions](../debugger/client-block-hook-functions.md)
 Provides guidance and a prototype for writing functions that validate or report the contents of the data stored in _CLIENT_BLOCK blocks.

 [Allocation Hook Functions](../debugger/allocation-hook-functions.md)
 Defines an allocation hook function, explores its different uses, points out restrictions, and provides a prototype.

 [Allocation Hooks and CRT Memory Allocations](../debugger/allocation-hooks-and-c-run-time-memory-allocations.md)
 Describes the restriction on allocation hook functions of explicitly ignoring `_CRT_BLOCK` blocks if they make any calls to C run-time library functions that allocate internal memory. This topic also lists the consequences if your allocation hook does not ignore `_CRT_BLOCK` blocks (with examples) and how to change the default allocation hook function, **CrtDefaultAllocHook**.

 [Report Hook Functions](../debugger/report-hook-functions.md)
 Discusses `_CrtSetReportHook`, which you can use to filter reports to focus on specific types of allocations. This topic also provides a prototype.
