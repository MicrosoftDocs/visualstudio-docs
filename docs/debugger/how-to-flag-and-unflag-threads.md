# How to: Flag and Unflag Threads (C#, Visual Basic, C++)

You can flag a thread that you want to give special attention by marking it with an icon in the **Threads**, **Parallel Stacks** (thread view), **Parallel Watch**, and **GPU Threads** windows. This icon can help you and others distinguish flagged threads from other threads.

Flagged threads also receive special treatment in the **Thread** list on the **Debug Location** toolbar and in the other multithreaded debugging windows. You can show all threads or only flagged threads in the **Thread** list or in the other windows.

### To flag or unflag a thread

- In the **Threads** or **Parallel Watch** window, find the thread you are interested in and click the flag icon to select or clear the flag.
- In the **Parallel Stacks** window, right-click on a thread or group of threads and select **Flag / \<thread>** or **Unflag / \<thread>**.

### To unflag all threads

- In the **Threads** window, right-click any thread and then click **Unflag All Threads**.
- In the **Parallel Watch** window, select all flagged threads, then right-click and select **Unflag**.

### To display only flagged threads

- Choose the **Show Flagged Threads Only** button in one of the multithreaded debugging windows.

### To flag Just My Code

1. On the toolbar at the top of the **Threads** window, click the flag icon.

2. In the drop-down list, click **Flag Just My Code**.

### To flag threads that are associated with selected modules

1. On the toolbar of the **Threads** window, click the flag icon.

2. In the drop-down list, click **Flag Custom Module Selection**.

3. In the **Select Modules** dialog box, select the modules that you want.

4. (Optional) In the **Search** box, type a string to search for specific modules.

5. Click **OK**.
