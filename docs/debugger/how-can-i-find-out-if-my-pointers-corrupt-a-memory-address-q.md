# How Can I Find Out If My Pointers Corrupt a Memory Address?
## Problem Description
 I think that one of my pointers may be corrupting memory at address 0x00408000. How can I find out what is happening there?

## Solution

#### Check for heap corruption

- Most memory corruption is actually due to heap corruption. Try using the Global Flags Utility (gflags.exe) or pageheap.exe. See [/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags-and-pageheap](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags-and-pageheap).

#### To find where the memory address is modified

1. Set a data breakpoint at 0x00408000. See [Set a data change breakpoint (native C++ only)](../debugger/using-breakpoints.md#BKMK_set_a_data_breakpoint_native_cplusplus).

2. When you hit the breakpoint, use the **Memory** window to view memory contents starting at 0x00408000. For more information, see [Memory Windows](../debugger/memory-windows.md).
