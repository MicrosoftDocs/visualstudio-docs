# Debug Versions of Heap Allocation Functions
The C run-time library contains special Debug versions of the heap allocation functions. These functions have the same names as the Release versions with _dbg appended to them. This topic describes the differences between the Release version of a CRT function and the _dbg version, using `malloc` and `_malloc_dbg` as examples.  
  
 When [_DEBUG](/cpp/c-runtime-library/debug) is defined, the CRT maps all [malloc](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloc) calls to [_malloc_dbg](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloc-dbg). Therefore, you do not need to rewrite your code using `_malloc_dbg` instead of `malloc` to receive the benefits while debugging.  
  
 You might want to call `_malloc_dbg` explicitly, however. Calling `_malloc_dbg` explicitly has some added benefits:  
  
-   Tracking `_CLIENT_BLOCK` type allocations.  
  
-   Storing the source file and line number where the allocation request occurred.  
  
 If you do not want to convert your `malloc` calls to `_malloc_dbg`, you can obtain the source file information by defining [_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC](/cpp/c-runtime-library/crtdbg-map-alloc), which causes the preprocessor to directly map all calls to `malloc` to `_malloc_dbg` instead of relying on a wrapper around `malloc`.  
  
 To track the separate types of allocations in client blocks, you must call `_malloc_dbg` directly and set the `blockType` parameter to `_CLIENT_BLOCK`.  
  
 When _DEBUG is not defined, calls to `malloc` are not disturbed, calls to `_malloc_dbg` are resolved to `malloc`, the definition of [_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC](/cpp/c-runtime-library/crtdbg-map-alloc) is ignored, and source file information pertaining to the allocation request is not provided. Because `malloc` does not have a block type parameter, requests for `_CLIENT_BLOCK` types are treated as standard allocations.
