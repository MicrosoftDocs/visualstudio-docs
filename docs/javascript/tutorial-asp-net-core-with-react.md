# Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core app with React in Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

In this article, you learn how to build an ASP.NET Core project to act as an API backend and a React project to act as the UI.

Visual Studio includes ASP.NET Core Single Page Application (SPA) templates that support Angular and React. The templates provide a built-in Client App folder in your ASP.NET Core projects that contains the base files and folders of each framework.

You can use the method described in this article to create ASP.NET Core Single Page Applications that:

- Put the client app in a separate project, outside from the ASP.NET Core project
- Create the client project based on the framework CLI installed on your computer

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7 or later with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload installed. Go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta) page to install it for free.
  If you need to install the workload and already have Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Choose the **ASP.NET and web development** workload, then choose **Modify**.
- npm ([https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)), which is included with Node.js
- npx ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx))

## Create the frontend app

1. In the Start window, select **Create a new project**. <!-- Avoid parenthetical clauses. https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/localization-mt-guidance?branch=main-->

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Create a new project":::

1. Search for React in the search bar at the top and then select **React and ASP.NET Core (Preview)**. This is a JavaScript template.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/react-choose-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing choosing a template":::

1. Name the project **ReactWithASP** and then choose **Create**.

   Solution Explorer shows the following:

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-with-react-solution-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Solution Explorer":::

   Compared to the [standalone React template](../javascript/tutorial-create-react-app.md), you see some new and modified files for integration with ASP.NET Core:

   - aspnetcore-https.js
   - vite.config.js
   - App.js (modified)
   - App.test.js (modified)

1. Select an installed browser from the Debug toolbar, such as Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

   If the browser you want is not yet installed, install the browser first, and then select it.

## Set the project properties

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the ***ReactWithASP.Server*** project and choose **Properties**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/react-choose-template2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing choosing a template":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-project-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Open project properties":::

1. In the Properties page, open the **Debug** tab and select **Open debug launch profiles UI** option. Uncheck the **Launch Browser** option for https.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-deselect-launch-browser.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Debug launch profiles UI"::: 

   This prevents opening the web page with the source weather data.

   >[!NOTE]
   > In Visual Studio, *launch.json* stores the startup settings associated with the **Start** button in the Debug toolbar. *launch.json* is in the *.vscode* folder.

## Start the project

Press **F5** or select the **Start** button at the top of the window to start the app. Two command prompts appear:

- The ASP.NET Core API project running
- The Vite CLI showing a message such as `VITE v4.4.9 ready in 780 ms`

   >[!NOTE]
   > Check console output for messages. For example there might be a message to update Node.js.

The React app appears and is populated via the API. If you don't see the app, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Publish the project

<!-- All this is unnecessary. I have much better instructions should you want to  keep them 
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the ***ReactWithASP.Server*** project and choose **Add** > **Project Reference**.

1. The **reactwithasp.client*** project is selected. Choose **OK**.

1. Right-click the***ReactWithASP.Server** project which opens the *.csproj* file for the project.

1. Notice the `<ReferenceOutputAssembly>` has the value set to `false`.

   When you've updated the reference, it should look like the following.  The project folder and project name differ.

   ```xml
   <ProjectReference Include="..\reactprojectfolder\reactprojectname.esproj">
       <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
   </ProjectReference>
   ```

1. Right.click the ASP.NET Core project and choose **Reload Project**.  -->

1. In *Program.cs*, update the check for `Environment.IsDevelopment` so it looks like the following.

   ```csharp
   // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
   if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
      app.UseSwagger();
      app.UseSwaggerUI();
   }
   else
   {
      app.UseDefaultFiles();
      app.UseStaticFiles();
   }
   ```

1. To publish, right click the ASP.NET Core project, choose **Publish**, and select options to match your desired publish scenario, such as Azure, publish to a folder, et al.

   The publish process takes more time than it does for just an ASP.NET Core project, since the `npm run build` command gets invoked when publishing.

   You can modify the `npm run build` command using the **Production Build Command** in the React project properties. To modify it, right-click the React project in Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**.

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy error

You may see the following error:

```cmd
[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /weatherforecast from localhost:4200 to https://localhost:7183 (ECONNREFUSED) (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)
```

If you see this issue, most likely the frontend started before the backend. Once you see the backend command prompt up and running, just refresh the React App in the browser.

### Verify ports

If the weather data does not load correctly, you may also need to verify that your ports are correct.

1. Make sure that the port numbers match. Go to the *launchSettings.json* file in your ASP.NET Core **webapi** project (in the *Properties* folder). Get the port number from the `applicationUrl` property.

   If there are multiple `applicationUrl` properties, look for one using an `https` endpoint. It looks similar to `https://localhost:7183`.

1. Open the *vite.config.js* file for the React project. Update the `target` property to match the `applicationUrl` property in *launchSettings.json*. The updated value looks similar to the following:

   ```js
   target: 'https://localhost:7183/',
   ```

### Privacy error

You may see the following certificate error:

```
Your connection isn't private
```

Try deleting the React certificates from *%appdata%\local\asp.net\https* or *%appdata%\roaming\asp.net\https*, and then retry.

## Next steps

For more information about SPA applications in ASP.NET Core, see the React section under [Developing Single Page Apps](/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/intro#developing-single-page-apps). The linked article provides additional context for project files such as *aspnetcore-https.js*, although details of the implementation are different based on the template differences. For example, instead of a ClientApp folder, the React files are contained in a separate project.
