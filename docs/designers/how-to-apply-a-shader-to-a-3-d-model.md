# How to: Apply a shader to a 3D model

This article demonstrates how to use the Model Editor to apply a Directed Graph Shader Language (DGSL) shader to a 3D model.

## Apply a shader to a 3D model

You can apply a shader effect to a 3D model to give it an interesting appearance.

Before you begin, make sure that the **Properties** window is displayed.

1. Begin with a 3D scene that contains one or more models. If you don't have a suitable 3D scene, create one as described in [How to: Create a basic 3D Model](../designers/how-to-create-a-basic-3-d-model.md). You must also have a DGSL shader that you can apply to the model. If you don't have a suitable shader, create one as described in [How to: Create a basic color shader](../designers/how-to-create-a-basic-color-shader.md) and make sure that you've saved it to a file before you continue.

2. In **Select** mode, select the model to which you want to apply the shader, and then in the **Properties** window, in the **Filename** property of the **Effect** property group, specify the DGSL shader that you want to apply to the model.

Here's a model that has the basic color effect applied to it:

After you apply a shader to a model, you can open it in the Shader Designer by selecting the model, and then in the **Properties** window, in the **(Advanced)** property of the **Effect** property group, choosing the ellipsis (**...**) button.
