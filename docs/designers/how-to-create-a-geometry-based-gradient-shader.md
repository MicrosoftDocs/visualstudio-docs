# How to: Create a geometry-based gradient shader

This article demonstrates how to use the Shader Designer and the Directed Graph Shader Language to create a geometry-based gradient shader. This shader scales a constant RGB color value by the height of each point of an object in world space.

## Create a geometry-based gradient shader

You can implement a geometry-based shader by incorporating the position of the pixel into your shader. In shading languages, a pixel contains more information than just its color and location on a 2D screen. A pixel—known as a *fragment* in some systems—is a collection of values that describe the surface that corresponds to a pixel. The shader that's described in this document utilizes the height of each pixel of a 3D object in world space to affect the final output color of the fragment.

Before you begin, make sure that the **Properties** window and the **Toolbox** are displayed.

1. Create a DGSL shader with which to work. For information about how to add a DGSL shader to your project, see the Getting Started section in [Shader Designer](../designers/shader-designer.md).

2. Disconnect the **Point Color** node from the **Final Color** node. Choose the **RGB** terminal of the **Point Color** node, and then choose **Break Links**. This makes room for the node that's added in the next step.

3. Add a **Multiply** node to the graph. In the **Toolbox**, under **Math**, select **Multiply** and move it to the design surface.

4. Add a **Mask Vector** node to the graph. In the **Toolbox**, under **Utility**, select **Mask Vector** and move it to the design surface.

5. Specify mask values for the **Mask Vector** node. In **Select** mode, select the **Mask Vector** node, and then in the **Properties** window, set the **Green / Y** property to **True**, and then set the **Red / X**, **Blue / Z** and **Alpha / W** properties to **False**. In this example, the **Red / X**, **Green / Y**, and **Blue / Z** properties correspond to the x, y, and z components of the **World Position** node, and **Alpha / W** is unused. Because only **Green / Y** is set to **True**, only the y component of the input vector remains after it is masked.

6. Add a **World Position** node to the graph. In the **Toolbox**, under **Constants**, select **World Position** and move it to the design surface.

7. Mask the world space position of the fragment. In **Select** mode, move the **Output** terminal of the **World Position** node to the **Vector** terminal of the **Mask Vector** node. This connection masks the position of the fragment to ignore the x and z components.

8. Multiply the RGB color constant by the masked world space position. Move the **RGB** terminal of the **Point Color** node to the **Y** terminal of the **Multiply** node, and then move the **Output** terminal of the **Mask Vector** node to the **X** terminal of the **Multiply** node. This connection scales the color value by the height of the pixel in world space.

9. Connect the scaled color value to the final color. Move the **Output** terminal of the **Multiply** node to the **RGB** terminal of the **Final Color** node.

The following illustration shows the completed shader graph and a preview of the shader applied to a sphere.

> [!NOTE]
> In this illustration, an orange color is specified to better demonstrate the effect of the shader, but because the preview shape has no position in world-space, the shader cannot be fully previewed in the Shader Designer. The shader must be previewed in a real scene to demonstrate the full effect.

Certain shapes might provide better previews for some shaders. For information about how to preview shaders in the Shader Designer, see **Previewing shaders** in [Shader Designer](../designers/shader-designer.md).

The following illustration shows the shader that's described in this document applied to the 3D scene that's demonstrated in [How to: Model 3D terrain](../designers/how-to-model-3-d-terrain.md). The intensity of the color increases with the height of the point in the world.
