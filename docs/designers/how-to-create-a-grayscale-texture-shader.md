# How to: Create a grayscale texture shader

This article demonstrates how to use the Shader Designer and the Directed Graph Shader Language (DGSL) to create a grayscale texture shader. This shader modifies the RGB color value of the texture sample, and then uses it together with the unmodified alpha value to set the final color.

## Create a grayscale texture shader

You can implement a grayscale texture shader by modifying the color value of a texture sample before you write it to the final output color.

Before you begin, make sure that the **Properties** window and the **Toolbox** are displayed.

1. Create a basic texture shader, as described in [How to: Create a basic texture shader](../designers/how-to-create-a-basic-texture-shader.md).

2. Disconnect the **RGB** terminal of the **Texture Sample** node from the **RGB** terminal of the **Final Color** node. In **Select** mode, choose the **RGB** terminal of the **Texture Sample** node, and then choose **Break Links**. This makes room for the node that's added in the next step.

3. Add a **Desaturate** node to the graph. In the **Toolbox**, under **Filters**, select **Desaturate** and move it to the design surface.

4. Calculate the grayscale value by using the **Desaturate** node. In **Select** mode, move the **RGB** terminal of the **Texture Sample** node to the **RGB** terminal of the **Desaturate** node.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the **Desaturate** node fully desaturates the input color, and uses the standard luminance weights for greyscale conversion. You can change how the **Desaturate** node behaves by changing the value of the **Luminance** property, or by only partially desaturating the input color. To partially desaturate the input color, provide a scalar value in the range [0,1) to the **Percent** terminal of the **Desaturate** node.

5. Connect the grayscale color value to the final color. Move the **Output** terminal of the **Desaturate** node to the **RGB** terminal of the **Final Color** node.

The following illustration shows the completed shader graph and a preview of the shader applied to a cube.

Certain shapes might provide better previews for some shaders. For more information about previewing shaders in the Shader Designer, see [Shader Designer](../designers/shader-designer.md).
