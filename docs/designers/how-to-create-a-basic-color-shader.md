# How to: Create a basic color shader

This article demonstrates how to use the Shader Designer and the Directed Graph Shader Language (DGSL) to create a flat color shader. This shader sets the final color to a constant RGB color value.

## Create a flat color shader

You can implement a flat color shader by writing the color value of an RGB color constant to the final output color.

Before you begin, make sure that the **Properties** window and the **Toolbox** are displayed.

1. Create a DGSL shader to work with. For information about how to add a DGSL shader to your project, see the Getting Started section in [Shader Designer](../designers/shader-designer.md).

2. Delete the **Point Color** node. Use the **Select** tool to select the **Point Color** node, and then on the menu bar, choose **Edit** > **Delete**.

3. Add a **Color Constant** node to the graph. In the **Toolbox**, under **Constants**, select **Color Constant** and move it to the design surface.

4. Specify a color value for the **Color Constant** node. Use the **Select** tool to select the **Color Constant** node, and then, in the **Properties** window, in the **Output** property, specify a color value. For orange, specify a value of (1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 1.0).

5. Connect the color constant to the final color. To create the connections, move the **RGB** terminal of the **Color Constant** node to the **RGB** terminal of the **Final Color** node, and then move the **Alpha** terminal of the **Color Constant** node to the **Alpha** terminal of the **Final Color** node. These connections set the final color to the color constant defined in the previous step.

The following illustration shows the completed shader graph and a preview of the shader applied to a cube.

> [!NOTE]
> In the illustration, an orange color was specified to better demonstrate the effect of the shader.

Certain shapes might provide better previews for some shaders. For more information about how to preview shaders in the Shader Designer, see [Shader Designer](../designers/shader-designer.md).
