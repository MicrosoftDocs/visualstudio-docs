# Constant nodes

In the Shader Designer, constant nodes represent literal values and interpolated vertex attributes in pixel-shader calculations. Because vertex attributes are interpolated—and so, are different for each pixel—each pixel-shader instance receives a different version of the constant. This gives each pixel a unique appearance.

## Vertex attribute interpolation

The image of a 3D scene in a game or app is made by mathematically transforming a number of objects—which are defined by vertices, vertex attributes, and primitive definitions—into on-screen pixels. All of the information that's required to give a pixel its unique appearance is supplied through vertex attributes, which are blended together according to the pixel's proximity to the different vertices that make up its *primitive*. A primitive is a basic rendering element; that is, a simple shape such as a point, a line, or a triangle. A pixel that's very close to just one of the vertices receives constants that are nearly identical to that vertex, but a pixel that's evenly spaced between all the vertices of a primitive receives constants that are the average of those vertices. In graphics programming, the constants that the pixels receive are said to be *interpolated*. Providing constant data to pixels in this way produces very good visual quality and at the same time reduces memory footprint and bandwidth requirements.

Although each pixel-shader instance receives only one set of constant values and cannot change these values, different pixel-shader instances receive different sets of constant data. This design enables a shader program to produce a different color output for each pixel in the primitive.
