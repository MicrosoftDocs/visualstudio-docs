# How to: Include a custom assembly in a BDC feature
  Your project can reference assemblies from other projects in the same solution. However, you must add these assemblies to the feature file of the project by using the **Assign referenced assemblies to LobSystems** dialog box.

### To include a custom assembly in a business data connectivity (BDC) feature

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the folder that contains the BDC model.

2. On the **View** menu, click **Properties Window**.

3. In the **Properties** window, choose the **Assemblies** property, and then the ellipsis button (![ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse](../sharepoint/media/mwellipsis.gif "ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse")).

     The **Assign referenced assemblies to LobSystems** dialog box appears.

4. In the **Select an Assembly** list, choose the custom assembly.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Assemblies only appear in the **Assign referenced assemblies to LobSystems** dialog box if you have added a reference to the project that contains the assembly. For more information, see [How to: Add or Remove References By Using the Add Reference Dialog Box](https://msdn.microsoft.com/3bd75d61-f00c-47c0-86a2-dd1f20e231c9).

5. In the **Reference Properties** group, open the list that appears for the **LobSystem Scope** property, choose the LOB System of the methods that use the custom assembly, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To debug code in the custom assembly, you must add the assembly to the solution package. For more information, see [How to: Add and remove additional assemblies](../sharepoint/how-to-add-and-remove-additional-assemblies.md).
