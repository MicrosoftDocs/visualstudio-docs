# How to: Add a project output reference
  To deploy non-SharePoint project assemblies (or .xap files in Silverlight projects) to SharePoint, add them as a project output reference.

 This process creates a solution build dependency between the two projects. Projects associated with project output references are built before the SharePoint project is built and deployed.

### To add a project output reference

1. Load a solution that contains at least one SharePoint project and one non-SharePoint project.

2. In **Solution Explorer**, choose an item in the SharePoint project node.

3. In the **Properties** window, choose the **Project Output References** property, and then choose the ellipsis (![ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse](../sharepoint/media/mwellipsis.gif "ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse")) button next to it.

4. In the **Project Output References** dialog box, choose the **Add** button.

5. In the properties pane, choose the arrow next to the **Deployment Type** property, and then choose an appropriate value for the non-SharePoint item you are referencing, such as **ElementFile**.

6. Choose the arrow next to **Project Name**, choose the name of the non-SharePoint project item, and then choose the **OK** button.
