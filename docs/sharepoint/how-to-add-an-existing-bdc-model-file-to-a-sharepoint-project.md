# How to: Add an existing BDC model file to a SharePoint project
  You can customize, package, and redeploy a Business Data Connectivity (BDC) model by using Visual Studio to add the model file (*.bdcm*) to any SharePoint farm project. For more information, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

### To add a BDC model file to a SharePoint project

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the folder for a SharePoint project.

2. On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add Existing Item**.

3. In the **Add Existing Item** dialog box, browse to the location of the model definition file that you want to add to your project, choose the file, and then choose the **Add** button.

    If the model doesn't define a *Line of Business (LOB) System of type .NET assembly*, the **Add .NET assembly LobSystem** dialog box opens.

4. If the dialog box appears, perform one of the following steps:

   - If you want to write custom code and use a designer to define the metadata for the imported model, choose the **Yes** button, name the system, and then choose the **OK** button.

   - Otherwise, choose the **No** button, and then choose the **OK** button.

     The **Business Data Connectivity Model** item is added to the project.
