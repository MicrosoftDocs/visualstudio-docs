# How to: Add a resource file
  The commands for adding resource files is on the shortcut menu of the solution node and feature nodes in Solution Explorer. For more information, see [Localizing SharePoint solutions](../sharepoint/localizing-sharepoint-solutions.md).

### To add a global resource file to a SharePoint solution

1. In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], open a SharePoint solution.

2. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a SharePoint project node, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

3. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, choose the **Global Resources File** template, and then choose the **Add** button.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Global Resources File project item template appears only when a SharePoint project item is selected.

4. In the **Add Resource** dialog box, choose a culture for the resource file, such as English (United States).

    This step adds a global resource file to your solution in the format, Resource_x_**.**<em>culture</em><strong>.</strong>resx, such as, *Resource1.en-US.resx*.

5. When the **Resource Editor** opens in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], add resources to the resource file.

### To add a feature resource file to a SharePoint feature

1. If the SharePoint solution is not already open in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], open the solution.

2. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the name of a feature under the **Features** node, and then choose **Add Feature Resource**.

     This step adds a resource file to the feature in the format, _ResourceFileName_**.**_culture_**.resx**, such as, *Feature1.en-US.resx*.

3. When the **Resource Editor** opens in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], add resources to the resource file.
