# How to: Add a parameter to a method
  Use a parameter to pass information into the method or to return information from a method. All methods must have at least one parameter. For more information about how to design a parameter to support the type of method that you want to create, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

 When you add a parameter to a method, Visual Studio adds the Parameter element to the XML of the model file in your project. For more information about the attributes of a Parameter element, see [Parameter](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee557705(v=office.14)).

### To add a parameter to a method

1. Add a method to an entity.

2. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Other Windows** > **BDC Method Details**.

     The **BDC Method Details** window opens. For more information, see [BDC Model Design Tools Overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).

3. In the **BDC Method Details** window, expand the node of the method, and then expand the **Parameters** node.

4. In the **Add a Parameter** list, choose **Create Parameter**.

     A new parameter appears beneath the **Parameters** node.

5. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

6. In the **Properties** window, set the **Name** property to any name that makes sense. For example, if the method will return customers, you might name the method **GetCustomers**.

7. In the **BDC Method Details** window, open the list that appears for the direction of the parameter, and then choose **In**, **InOut**, **Out**, or **Return**.

     For more information about which direction to choose for the type method that you are creating, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

8. Modify the type descriptor of the parameter. For more information, see [How to: Define the type descriptor of a parameter](../sharepoint/how-to-define-the-type-descriptor-of-a-parameter.md).
