# How to: Create a BDC model
  You can create a Business Data Connectivity (BDC) model by using the template for that kind of item and then adding the model to any SharePoint project. For more information, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md). For more information about how to design the model, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

### To create a BDC project

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your IDE is set to use Visual Basic development settings, choose **File** > **New Project**.

     The **New Project** dialog box opens.

2. Under either **Visual Basic** or **Visual C#**, choose **Office/SharePoint**, **SharePoint Solutions**.

3. In the **Templates** pane, choose the **SharePoint 2013 - Empty Project** item, and then choose the **OK** button.

     The **SharePoint Customization Wizard** opens.

4. On the **Specify the site and security level for debugging** page, specify the URL of a SharePoint site on the local computer, choose the **Deploy as farm solution** option button, and then choose the **Finish** button.

     You will test the model on the SharePoint site that you specified.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must deploy the project as a farm solution because BDC models support only farm solutions.

     An empty SharePoint project is created.

5. On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

6. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, choose the **Office/SharePoint** node.

7. In the list of SharePoint templates, choose **Business Data Connectivity Model (Farm Solution Only)**.

8. In the **Name** box, specify a name for the BDC model, and then choose the **Add** button.

     A **Business Data Connectivity Model** item is added to the project. By default, the model appears in the BDC designer. For more information, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).
