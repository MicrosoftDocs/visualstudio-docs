# Create site definitions for SharePoint
  The SharePoint Site Definition project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] lets you create a *site definition*, which serves as a foundation for a new SharePoint site. These definitions not only determine the appearance and behavior of the SharePoint site, but also its default content and functionality. In the definition you can put preconfigured lists, content types, event receivers, images, and other items. SharePoint includes some site definitions such as BLOG, for example. When you create a site based on the BLOG site definition, the site contains the lists, Web parts, and other items that a blogging site requires.

 For more information about site definitions, see [Site Templates and Definitions](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ms434313(v=office.14)).

## Site definition projects
 Site definition projects in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] provide only the basic files that a SharePoint site needs; they do not provide any default functionality. You must add files and content to provide the functionality that you want. You can build the site manually, by creating and adding the files that you need.

## Feature stapling
 One benefit of creating site definitions in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] is that they automatically use *Feature Stapling*. Feature Stapling attaches a feature to a site definition instead of embedding its functionality in the site definition itself. Doing this lets you add the feature to any site created by using the site definition without modifying the original site definition. For more information, see [Feature Stapling](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2007/bb861862(v=office.12)).

## Site definition project components
 When you create a site definition solution, the following default files are added to its **SiteDefinition** node.

|File Name|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*default.aspx*|The default ASPX home page for the new SharePoint site.|
|*onet.xml*|Specifies the configuration of the new site, the components of the site definition template, and default behavior. These settings can include attributes such as the content types that are enabled, the default list views, document template files, and Web parts included with the site. By default, the `Modules` section lists the files to be added to the SharePoint site and how they are configured.|
|*webtemp_\<SiteDefinitionName>.xml*|Specifies the site definition configurations that appears in the **Template Selection** section of the **New SharePoint Site** page.|

 By default, all site definitions are stored in the *\<drive:>\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\SiteTemplates* folder. Each site definition has its own subfolder.
