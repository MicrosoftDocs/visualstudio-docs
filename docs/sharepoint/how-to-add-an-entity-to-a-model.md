# How to: Add an entity to a model
  To create an entity, add an entity control from the Visual Studio **Toolbox** onto the Business Data Connectivity (BDC) designer.

### To add an entity to the model

1. Create a BDC project, or open an existing BDC project. For more information, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

2. In the **Toolbox**, from the **BusinessDataCatalog** group, add an **Entity** control onto the designer.

     The new entity appears on the designer. Visual Studio adds an `<Entity>` element to the XML of the BDC model file in your project. For more information about the attributes of an Entity element, see [Entity](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee558325(v=office.14)).

3. On the designer, open the shortcut menu for the entity, choose **Add**, and then choose **Identifier**.

     A new identifier appears on the entity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can change the name of the entity and the identifier in the **Properties** window.

4. Define the fields of the entity in a class. You can either add a new class to the project or use an existing class created by using other tools such as the Object Relational Designer (O/R Designer). The following example shows an entity class named Contact.

     [!code-csharp[SP_BDC_Entity_Data_Class#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/sp_bdc_entity_data_class/bdcmodel1/contact.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[SP_BDC_Entity_Data_Class#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/sp_bdc_entity_data_class/bdcmodel1/contact.vb#1)]
