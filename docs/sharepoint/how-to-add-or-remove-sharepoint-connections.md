# How to: Add or remove SharePoint connections
  Server Explorer lets you browse SharePoint sites as well as data connections. However, before you can browse the contents of a SharePoint site you must add it to the **SharePoint Connections** node.

### To add a SharePoint site to the SharePoint connections node

1. On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Server Explorer**.

2. In **Server Explorer**, choose the **SharePoint Connections** node, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Add SharePoint Connection**.

3. In the **Add SharePoint Connection** box, enter the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_url](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-url-md.md)] for the SharePoint site (for example, http://testserver/sites/unittests).

### To delete a SharePoint site from the SharePoint connections node

1. On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Server Explorer** to open **Server Explorer**.

2. Expand the **SharePoint Connections** node to reveal the SharePoint site that you want to delete from **Server Explorer**.

3. Choose the site, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Edit** > **Delete**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This step doesn't delete the underlying site; it deletes only the connection from **Server Explorer**.
