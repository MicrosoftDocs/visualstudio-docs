# How to: Add a Deleter method
  You can enable an end user to delete a data record from an external list on a SharePoint site by adding a Deleter method to the model. For more information, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

### To create a Deleter method

1. On the **BDC Designer**, choose an entity.

2. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Other Windows** > **BDC Method Details**.

    The **BDC Method Details** window opens. For more information about this window, see [BDC model design tools overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).

3. In the **Add a Method** list, choose **Create a Deleter Method**.

    Visual Studio adds the following elements to the model. These elements appear in the **BDC Method Details** window.

   - A method named **Delete**.

   - An input parameter for the method.

   - A type descriptor for the parameter.

   - A method instance for the method.

     For more information, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

4. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu of the service code file that was generated for the entity, and then choose **View Code**.

    The entity service code file opens in the Code Editor. For more information about the entity service code file, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

5. Add code to the Deleter method to delete a record. The following example deletes a line item from a sales order by using the AdventureWorks sample database for SQL Server.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The method in this example uses two input parameters.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Replace the value of the `ServerName` field with the name of your server.
