## Attributes and elements
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|Attribute|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|**DefaultFile**|Optional **xs: string** attribute.<br /><br /> The relative path, including the file name, of the file that opens in the Visual Studio editor when you open the SharePoint project item in **Solution Explorer**. The path is relative from the folder that contains the *.spdata* file.|
|**FeatureReceiverClass**|Optional **xs:string** attribute.<br /><br /> The fully qualified name of a feature receiver class for this SharePoint project item. For more information about feature receivers, see [Provide packaging and deployment information in project items](../sharepoint/providing-packaging-and-deployment-information-in-project-items.md).|
|**FeatureReceiverAssembly**|Optional **xs:string** attribute.<br /><br /> Specifies the fully qualified name of an assembly that defines a feature receiver for this SharePoint project item. For more information about feature receivers, see [Provide packaging and deployment information in project items](../sharepoint/providing-packaging-and-deployment-information-in-project-items.md). For more information about fully qualified assembly names, see [Assembly Names](/dotnet/framework/app-domains/assembly-names).|
|**SupportedTrustLevels**|Optional **xs:string** attribute.<br /><br /> Specifies the trust levels that this SharePoint project item supports. This value can be one of the following strings: Sandboxed, FullTrust, or All. The value All specifies both Sandboxed and FullTrust.<br /><br /> In a custom SharePoint project item type, the value of this attribute corresponds to the value that you assign to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeDefinition.SupportedTrustLevels%2A> property in your implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeProvider.InitializeType%2A> method. If you specify a different value for this attribute, Visual Studio overwrites the value so that it specifies the same trust level that you specify in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeDefinition.SupportedTrustLevels%2A> property.|
|**SupportedDeploymentScopes**|Optional **xs:string** attribute.<br /><br /> Specifies the deployment scopes that this SharePoint project item supports. This value is a comma-delimited string that consists of one or more of the following strings: Farm, Site, Web, WebApplication, or Package. For example: `Web, Site`<br /><br /> In a custom SharePoint project item type, the value of this attribute corresponds to the value that you assign to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeDefinition.SupportedDeploymentScopes%2A> property in your implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeProvider.InitializeType%2A> method. If you specify a different value for this attribute, Visual Studio overwrites the value so that it specifies the same trust level that you specify in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectItemTypeDefinition.SupportedDeploymentScopes%2A> property.|
|**Type**|Required **xs:string** attribute.<br /><br /> The identifier for the SharePoint project item. In a custom SharePoint project item type, the identifier is the string that you pass to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.SharePointProjectItemTypeAttribute>. For more information, see [How to: Define a SharePoint project item type](../sharepoint/how-to-define-a-sharepoint-project-item-type.md).<br /><br /> For a list of the identifiers for the built-in SharePoint project items included with Visual Studio, see [Extend SharePoint project items](../sharepoint/extending-sharepoint-project-items.md).|
