# How to: Define a method instance
  You must define at least one method instance for every method in your model.

 Add a method instance by using the **BDC Method Details** window. When you add the method instance, Visual Studio adds a `<MethodInstance>` element to the XML of the model file in your project. For more information about the attributes of a `<MethodInstance>` element, see [MethodInstance](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee556838(v=office.14)).

### To define a method instance

1. In the **BDC Method Details** window, expand the node of a method, and then expand the **Instances** node.

2. In the **Add a Method Instance** list, choose **Create Finder Instance**.

     A new method instance appears beneath the **Instances** node.

3. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

4. In the **Properties** window, set the properties of the method instance. For more information about each property, see [MethodInstance](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee556838(v=office.14)).
