# How to: Add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint projects
  You can add a shortcut menu item to any SharePoint project. The menu item appears when a user right-clicks a project node in **Solution Explorer**.

 The following steps assume that you have already created a project extension. For more information, see [How to: Create a SharePoint project extension](../sharepoint/how-to-create-a-sharepoint-project-extension.md).

### To add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint projects

1. In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension.Initialize%2A> method of your <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension> implementation, handle the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectMenuItemsRequested> event of the *projectService* parameter.

2. In your event handler for the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectMenuItemsRequested> event, add a new <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem> object to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.SharePointProjectMenuItemsRequestedEventArgs.ActionMenuItems%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.SharePointProjectMenuItemsRequestedEventArgs.AddMenuItems%2A> collection of the event arguments parameter.

3. In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem.Click> event handler for the new <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.IMenuItem> object, perform the tasks you want to execute when a user clicks your shortcut menu item.

## Example
 The following code example demonstrates how to add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint project nodes in **Solution Explorer**. When the user right-clicks a project node and clicks the **Write Message to Output Window** menu item, Visual Studio displays a message in the **Output** window. This example uses the SharePoint project service to display the message. For more information, see [Use the SharePoint project service](../sharepoint/using-the-sharepoint-project-service.md).

 [!code-csharp[SPExtensibility.ProjectExtension.Menu#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/projectmenu/extension/projectitemextensionmenu.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[SPExtensibility.ProjectExtension.Menu#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/projectmenu/extension/projectitemextensionmenu.vb#1)]

## Compile the code
 This example requires a class library project with references to the following assemblies:

- Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint

- System.ComponentModel.Composition

## Deploy the extension
 To deploy the extension, create a [!include[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extension (VSIX) package for the assembly and any other files that you want to distribute with the extension. For more information, see [Deploy extensions for the SharePoint tools in Visual Studio](../sharepoint/deploying-extensions-for-the-sharepoint-tools-in-visual-studio.md).
