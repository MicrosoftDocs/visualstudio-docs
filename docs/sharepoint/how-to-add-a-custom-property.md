# How to: Add a custom property
  You can add custom properties to the model by using the **Property Editor**. You can access these properties in code to retrieve information such as connection strings and other data at run time.

### To add a custom property

1. In the **BDC Explorer**, choose the node that represents the model element to which you want to apply a custom property.

2. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

3. In the **Properties** window, choose the **Custom Properties** property, and then choose the ellipsis button (![ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse](../sharepoint/media/mwellipsis.gif "ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse")).

     The **Property Editor** dialog box appears.

4. In the text box in the **Name** column, specify the name of the property.

5. For the **Type** field of the custom property, choose the appropriate data type.

6. For the **Value** field of the custom property, specify a value, and then choose the **OK** button.
