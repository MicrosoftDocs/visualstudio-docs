# How to: Edit a SharePoint deployment configuration
  You can create a deployment configuration or modify an existing deployment configuration. For example, you could run a single step or change the order of the steps in the deployment process. You may want to create or modify deployment configurations because the built-in and programmatically added configurations cannot be changed.

## Create a SharePoint deployment configuration

#### To create a SharePoint deployment configuration

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a SharePoint project, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project**, _ProjectName_**Properties**.

2. On the **SharePoint** tab, choose the **New** button.

     The **Add New Deployment Configuration** dialog box appears.

3. In the **Name** text box, enter a name for the deployment configuration.

4. In the **Available Deployment Steps** pane, choose the steps that you want to add to the deployment configuration, choose the (**>**) button, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have configured a pre-deployment command or a post-deployment command, these steps run only if you add them to a customized deployment configuration.

## Change the active deployment configuration

#### To change the active deployment configuration

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a SharePoint project, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project** > **\<*ProjectName*> Properties**.

2. Choose the **SharePoint** tab.

3. In the **Active Deployment Configuration** list box, choose the name of the deployment configuration that you want to use.
