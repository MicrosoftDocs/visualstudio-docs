# How to: Create an event receiver
  By creating *event receivers*, you can respond when a user interacts with SharePoint items such as lists or list items. For example, the code in an event receiver can be triggered when a user changes the calendar or deletes a name from a contacts list. By following this topic, you can learn how to add an event receiver to a list instance.

 To complete these steps, you must have installed [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and supported editions of Windows and SharePoint. Because this example requires a SharePoint project, you also must have completed the procedure in the topic [Walkthrough: Create a site column, content type, and list for SharePoint](../sharepoint/walkthrough-create-a-site-column-content-type-and-list-for-sharepoint.md).

## Adding an event receiver
 The project that you created in [Walkthrough: Create a site column, content type, and list for SharePoint](../sharepoint/walkthrough-create-a-site-column-content-type-and-list-for-sharepoint.md) includes custom site columns, a custom list, and a content type. In the following procedure, you'll expand this project by adding a simple event handler (an event receiver) to a list instance to show how to handle events that occur in SharePoint items such as lists.

#### To add an event receiver to the list instance

1. Open the project that you created in [Walkthrough: Create a site column, content type, and list for SharePoint](../sharepoint/walkthrough-create-a-site-column-content-type-and-list-for-sharepoint.md).

2. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the SharePoint project node, which is named **Clinic**.

3. On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

4. Under either **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, expand the **SharePoint** node, and then choose the **2010** item.

5. In the **Templates** pane, choose **Event Receiver**, name it **TestEventReceiver1**, and then choose the **OK** button.

     The **SharePoint Customization Wizard** appears.

6. In the **What type of event receiver do you want?** list, choose **List Item Events**.

7. In the **What item should be the event source?** list, choose **Patients (Clinic\Patients)**.

8. In the **Handle the following events** list, select the check box next to **An item was added**, and then choose the **Finish** button.

     The code file for the new event receiver contains a single method that's named `ItemAdded`. In the next step, you'll add code to this method so that every contact will be named Scott Brown by default.

9. Replace the existing `ItemAdded` method with the following code, and then choose the **F5** key:

     [!code-csharp[SP_EventReceiver#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/CustomField1/TestEventReceiver1/TestEventReceiver1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[SP_EventReceiver#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/CustomField1_VB/EventReceiver1/EventReceiver1.vb#1)]

     The code runs, and the SharePoint site appears in the web browser.

10. On the QuickLaunch bar, choose the **Patients** link, and then choose the **Add New Item** link.

     The entry form for new items opens.

11. Enter data in the fields, and then choose the **Save** button.

     After you choose the **Save** button, the **Patient Name** column automatically updates to the name Scott Brown.
