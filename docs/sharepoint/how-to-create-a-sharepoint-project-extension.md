# How to: Create a SharePoint project extension
  Create a project extension when you want to add functionality to any SharePoint project that is open in Visual Studio. For more information, see [Extend the SharePoint project system](../sharepoint/extending-the-sharepoint-project-system.md).

### To create a project extension

1. Create a class library project.

2. Add references to the following assemblies:

    - Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint

    - System.ComponentModel.Composition

3. Create a class that implements the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension> interface.

4. Add the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Composition.ExportAttribute> to the class. This attribute enables Visual Studio to discover and load your <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension> implementation. Pass the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension> type to the attribute constructor.

5. In your implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectExtension.Initialize%2A> method, use members of the *projectService* parameter to define the behavior of your extension. This parameter is an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectService> object that provides access to the events defined in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents> interface.

## Example
 The following code example demonstrates how to create a simple project extension that handles most of the SharePoint project events that are defined by the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents> interface. To test the code, create a SharePoint project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and then add more projects to the solution, change project property values, or delete or exclude a project. The extension notifies you of the events by writing messages to the **Output** window and **Error List** window.

  ```vb
    Imports Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint
    Imports System.ComponentModel
    Imports System.ComponentModel.Composition

    Namespace Contoso.ExampleProjectExtension
      <Export(GetType(ISharePointProjectExtension))> _
      Class ExampleProjectExtension
        Implements ISharePointProjectExtension

        Private WithEvents projectService As ISharePointProjectService

        Public Sub Initialize(ByVal projectService As ISharePointProjectService) _
            Implements ISharePointProjectExtension.Initialize
            Me.projectService = projectService
        End Sub

        ' A project was added.
        Private Sub projectService_ProjectAdded(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SharePointProjectEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectAdded
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The following project was added: {0}", e.Project.Name)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub

        ' A project was loaded in the IDE.
        Private Sub projectService_ProjectInitialized(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SharePointProjectEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectInitialized
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The following project is being initialized: {0}", e.Project.Name)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub

        ' The name of a property was changed.
        Private Sub projectService_ProjectNameChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As NameChangedEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectNameChanged
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The project named {0} was changed to {1}.", e.OldName, project.Name)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub

        ' A project property value was changed.
        Private Sub ProjectPropertyChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As PropertyChangedEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectPropertyChanged
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The following property of the {0} project was changed: {1}",
                project.Name, e.PropertyName)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub

        ' A project is being removed or unloaded.
        Private Sub projectService_ProjectRemoved(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SharePointProjectEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectRemoved
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The following project is being removed or unloaded: {0}", e.Project.Name)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub

        ' A project was removed or unloaded.
        Private Sub projectService_ProjectDisposing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SharePointProjectEventArgs) _
            Handles projectService.ProjectDisposing
            Dim project As ISharePointProject = CType(sender, ISharePointProject)
            Dim message As String = String.Format("The following project was removed or unloaded: {0}", e.Project.Name)
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message)
        End Sub
      End Class
    End Namespace
    ```

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint;

    using System.ComponentModel;
    using System.ComponentModel.Composition;

    namespace Contoso.ExampleProjectExtension
    {

        }

        // A project was added.
        void projectService_ProjectAdded(object sender, SharePointProjectEventArgs e)
        {
            ISharePointProject project = (ISharePointProject)sender;
            string message = String.Format("The following project was added: {0}", e.Project.Name);

        {
            ISharePointProject project = (ISharePointProject)sender;
            string message = String.Format("The following project is being initialized: {0}", e.Project.Name);
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message);
        }

        // The name of a project was changed.

            string message = String.Format("The following property of the {0} project was changed: {1}",
                project.Name, e.PropertyName);
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message);
        }

        // A project is being removed or unloaded.
        void projectService_ProjectRemoved(object sender, SharePointProjectEventArgs e)
        {
            ISharePointProject project = (ISharePointProject)sender;
            string message = String.Format("The following project is being removed or unloaded: {0}", e.Project.Name);
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message);
        }

        // A project was removed or unloaded.
        void projectService_ProjectDisposing(object sender, SharePointProjectEventArgs e)
        {
            ISharePointProject project = (ISharePointProject)sender;
            string message = String.Format("The following project was removed or unloaded: {0}", e.Project.Name);
            project.ProjectService.Logger.WriteLine(message, LogCategory.Message);
        }
     }
  }
  ```

This example uses the SharePoint project service to write the message to the **Output** window and **Error List** window. For more information, see [Use the SharePoint project service](../sharepoint/using-the-sharepoint-project-service.md).

 For examples that demonstrate how to handle the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectMenuItemsRequested> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.ISharePointProjectEvents.ProjectPropertiesRequested> events, see [How to: Add a shortcut menu item to SharePoint projects](../sharepoint/how-to-add-a-shortcut-menu-item-to-sharepoint-projects.md) and [How to: Add a property to SharePoint projects](../sharepoint/how-to-add-a-property-to-sharepoint-projects.md).

## Compile the code
 This example requires references to the following assemblies:

- Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint

- System.ComponentModel.Composition

## Deploy the extension
 To deploy the extension, create a [!include[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extension (VSIX) package for the assembly and any other files that you want to distribute with the extension. For more information, see [Deploy Extensions for the SharePoint tools in Visual Studio](../sharepoint/deploying-extensions-for-the-sharepoint-tools-in-visual-studio.md).
