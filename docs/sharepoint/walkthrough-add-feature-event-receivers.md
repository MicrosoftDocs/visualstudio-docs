# Walkthrough: Add feature event receivers
  Feature event receivers are methods that execute when one of the following feature-related events occurs in SharePoint:

- A feature is installed.

- A feature is activated.

- A feature is deactivated.

- A feature is removed.

  This walkthrough demonstrates how to add an event receiver to a feature in a SharePoint project. It demonstrates the following tasks:

- Creating an empty project with a feature event receiver.

- Handling the **FeatureDeactivating** method.

- Using the SharePoint project object model to add an announcement to the Announcements list.

  [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../sharepoint/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]

## Prerequisites
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- Supported editions of Microsoft Windows and SharePoint.

- Visual Studio.

## Create a feature event receiver project
 First, create a project to contain the feature event receiver.

#### To create a project with a feature event receiver

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project** to display the **New Project** dialog box.

2. Expand the **SharePoint** node under either **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, and then choose the **2010** node.

3. In the **Templates** pane, choose the **SharePoint 2010 Project** template.

     You use this project type for feature event receivers because they have no project template.

4. In the **Name** box, enter **FeatureEvtTest**, and then choose the **OK** button to display the **SharePoint Customization Wizard**.

5. On the **Specify the site and security level for debugging** page, enter the URL for the SharePoint server site to which you want to add the new custom field item, or use the default location (http://\<*system name*>/).

6. In the **What is the trust level for this SharePoint solution?** section, choose the **Deploy as a farm solution** option button.

     For more information about sandboxed solutions versus farm solutions, see [Sandboxed solution considerations](../sharepoint/sandboxed-solution-considerations.md).

7. Choose the **Finish** button, and then notice that a feature that's named Feature1 appears under the **Features** node.

## Add an event receiver to the feature
 Next, add an event receiver to the feature and add code that executes when the feature is deactivated.

#### To add an event receiver to the feature

1. Open the shortcut menu for the Features node, and then choose **Add Feature** to create a feature.

2. Under the **Features** node, open the shortcut menu for **Feature1**, and then choose **Add Event Receiver** to add an event receiver to the feature.

     This adds a code file under Feature1. In this case, it is named either *Feature1.EventReceiver.cs* or *Feature1.EventReceiver.vb*, depending on your project's development language.

3. If your project is written in [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../sharepoint/includes/csprcs-md.md)], add the following code at the top of the event receiver if it is not already there:

     [!code-csharp[SP_FeatureEvt#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/featureevttest2/features/feature1/feature1.eventreceiver.cs#1)]

4. The event receiver class contains several commented-out methods that act as events. Replace the **FeatureDeactivating** method with the following:

     [!code-vb[SP_FeatureEvt#2](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/featureevt2vb/features/feature1/feature1.eventreceiver.vb#2)]
     [!code-csharp[SP_FeatureEvt#2](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/featureevttest2/features/feature1/feature1.eventreceiver.cs#2)]

## Test the feature event receiver
 Next, deactivate the feature to test whether the **FeatureDeactivating** method outputs an announcement to the SharePoint Announcements list.

#### To test the feature event receiver

1. Set the value of the project's **Active Deployment Configuration** property to **No Activation**.

     Setting this property prevents the feature from activating in SharePoint and lets you debug feature event receivers. For more information, see [Debug SharePoint solutions](../sharepoint/debugging-sharepoint-solutions.md).

2. Choose the **F5** key to run the project and deploy it to SharePoint.

3. At the top of the SharePoint Web page, open the **Site Actions** menu, and then choose **Site Settings**.

4. Under the **Site Actions** section of the **Site Settings** page, choose the **Manage site features** link.

5. On the **Features** page, choose the **Activate** button next to the **FeatureEvtTest Feature1** Feature.

6. On the **Features** page, choose the **Deactivate** button next to the **FeatureEvtTest Feature1** Feature, and then choose the **Deactivate this feature** confirmation link to deactivate the Feature.

7. Choose the **Home** button.

     Notice that an announcement appears in the **Announcements** list after the feature is deactivated.
