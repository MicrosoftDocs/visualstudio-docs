# How to: Add a specific Finder method
  You can return a single entity instance by creating a *Specific Finder* method. The Business Data Connectivity (BDC) service executes the Specific Finder method when a user chooses an entity in a business data web part or external list. For more information, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

### To create a specific Finder method

1. On the **BDC Designer**, choose an entity.

    For information about how to add an entity to the **BDC Designer** in Visual Studio, see [How to: Add an entity to a model](../sharepoint/how-to-add-an-entity-to-a-model.md).

2. On the menu bar, choose **View** > **Other Windows**, **BDC Method Details**.

    The **BDC Method Details** window opens. For more information about that window, see [BDC model design tools overview](../sharepoint/bdc-model-design-tools-overview.md).

3. In the **Add a Method** list, choose **Create Specific Finder Method**.

    Visual Studio adds the following elements to the model. These elements appear in the **BDC Method Details** window.

   - A method.

   - An input parameter for the method.

   - A return parameter for the method.

   - A type descriptor for each parameter.

   - A method instance for the method.

     For more information, see [Design a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

4. Open the Visual Studio **Properties** window.

5. Configure the type descriptor of the return parameter as an entity type descriptor. For information about how to create an entity type descriptor, see [How to: Define the type descriptor of a parameter](../sharepoint/how-to-define-the-type-descriptor-of-a-parameter.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You don't have to perform this step if you have added a Finder method to the entity. Visual Studio uses the type descriptor that you defined in the Finder method.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the identifier field of the entity type represents a field in a database table that's automatically generated, set the **Read-only** property of the identifier field to **True**.

6. In the **Method Details** window, choose the method instance of the method.

7. In the **Properties Window**, set the **Return Parameter Name** property to the name of the return parameter of the method. For more information about method instance properties, see [MethodInstance](/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee556838(v=office.14)).

8. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu of the service code file that was generated for the entity, and then choose **View Code**.

    The entity service code file opens in the Code Editor. For more information about the entity service code file, see [Create a business data connectivity model](../sharepoint/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).

9. Add code to the Specific Finder method. This code performs the following tasks:

   - Retrieves a record from a data source.

   - Returns an entity to the BDC service.

     The following example returns a contact from the AdventureWorks sample database for SQL Server.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Replace the value of the `ServerName` field with the name of your server.
