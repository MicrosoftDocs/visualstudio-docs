# Walkthrough: Create a basic site definition project
  This walkthrough shows you how to create a basic site definition that contains a visual Web part with some controls on it. For the sake of clarity, the visual Web part that you create has only a few controls. However, you can create more sophisticated SharePoint site definitions that include more functionality.

 This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:

- Creating a site definition by using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project template.

- Creating a SharePoint site by using a site definition in SharePoint.

- Adding a visual Web part to the solution.

- Customizing the site's default.aspx page by adding the new visual Web part to it.

  [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../sharepoint/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]

## Prerequisites
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- Supported editions of Microsoft Windows and SharePoint. For more information, see Requirements for Developing SharePoint Solutions.

- Visual Studio.

## Create a site definition solution
 First, create the site definition project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)].

#### To create a site definition project

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project**. If your IDE is set to use Visual Basic development settings, on the menu bar, choose **File** > **New Project**.

    The **New Project** dialog box appears.

2. Expand the **Visual C#** node or the **Visual Basic** node, expand the **SharePoint** node, and then choose the **2010** node.

3. In the **Templates** list, choose the **SharePoint 2010 Project** template.

4. In the **Name** box, enter **TestSiteDef**, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The **SharePoint Customization Wizard** appears.

5. On the **Specify the site and security level for debugging** page, enter the URL for the SharePoint site where you want to debug the site definition, or use the default location (http://<em>System Name</em>/).

6. In the **What is the trust level for this SharePoint solution?** section, choose the **Deploy as a farm solution** option button.

    All site definition projects must be deployed as farm solutions. For more information about sandboxed solutions versus farm solutions, see [Sandboxed solution considerations](../sharepoint/sandboxed-solution-considerations.md).

7. Choose the **Finish** button.

    The project appears in **Solution Explorer**.

8. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the project node, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

9. Under either **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, expand the **SharePoint** node, and then choose the **2010** node.

10. In the **Templates** pane, choose the **Site Definition** template, leave the **Name** as **SiteDefinition1**, and then choose the **Add** button.

## Create a visual web part
 Next, create a visual Web part to appear on the site definition's main page.

#### To create a visual web part

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the **Show All Files** button.

2. Choose the **SiteDefinition1** project node, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add New Item**.

     The **Add New Item** dialog box appears.

3. Expand the **Visual C#** node or the **Visual Basic** node, expand the **SharePoint** node, and then choose the **2010** node.

4. In the list of templates, choose the **Visual Web Part** template, keep the default name VisualWebPart1, and then choose the **Add** button.

     The *VisualWebPart1.ascx* file opens.

5. At the bottom of *VisualWebPart1.ascx*, add the following markup to add three controls to the form: a text box, a button, and a label:

    ```aspx-csharp
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <asp:TextBox runat="server" ID="tbName"></asp:TextBox>
        </td>
        <td>
          <asp:Button runat="server" ID="btnSubmit" Text = "Change Label Text" OnClick="btnSubmit_Click"></asp:Button>
        </td>
        <td>
          <asp:Label runat="server" ID="lblName"></asp:Label>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    ```

6. Under *VisualWebPart1.ascx*, open the *VisualWebPart1.ascx.cs* file (for [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../sharepoint/includes/csprcs-md.md)]) or *VisualWebPart1.ascx.vb* (for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../sharepoint/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) , and then add the following code:

     [!code-vb[SP_SimpleSiteDef#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/VisualBasic/testsitedefvb/sitedefinition/visualwebpart1/visualwebpart1usercontrol.ascx.vb#1)]
     [!code-csharp[SP_SimpleSiteDef#1](../sharepoint/codesnippet/CSharp/testsitedef/sitedefinition/visualwebpart1/visualwebpart1usercontrol.ascx.cs#1)]

     This code adds functionality for the web part's button click.

## Add the visual web part to the default ASPX page
 Next, add the visual Web part to the site definition's default ASPX page.

#### To add a visual web part to the default ASPX page

1. Open the default.aspx page, and then add the following line under the `WebPartPages` tag:

    ```aspx-csharp
    <%@ Register Tagprefix="MyWebPartControls" Namespace="TestSiteDef.VisualWebPart1" Assembly="$SharePoint.Project.AssemblyFullName$" %>
    ```

     This line associates the name MyWebPartControls with the Web part and its code. The *Namespace* parameter matches the namespace that's used in the *VisualWebPart1.ascx* code file.

2. After the `</asp:Content>` element, replace the entire `ContentPlaceHolderId="PlaceHolderMain"` section and its contents with the following code:

    ```aspx-csharp
    <asp:Content ID="Content1" ContentPlaceHolderId="PlaceHolderMain" runat="server">
        <MyWebPartControls:VisualWebPart1 runat="server" />
    </asp:Content>
    ```

     This code creates a reference to the visual Web part that you created earlier.

3. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the **SiteDefinition1** node, and then choose **Set as Startup Item**.

## Deploy and run the site definition solution
 Next, deploy the project to SharePoint, and then run the project.

#### To deploy and run the site definition

- On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Deploy TestSiteDef**.

- Choose the **F5** key.

     Visual Studio compiles the code, adds its features, packages all of the files into a SharePoint solution (WSP) file, and deploys the WSP file to SharePoint Server. SharePoint then installs the files and then activates the features.

## Create a site based on the site definition
 Next, create a site by using the new site definition.

#### To create a site by using the site definition

1. On the SharePoint site, the New SharePoint Site page appears.

2. In the **Title and Description** section, enter **My New Site** for the title and a description of the site.

3. In the **Web Site Address** section, enter **mynewsite** in the **URL name** box.

4. In the **Template** section, choose the **SharePoint Customizations** tab.

5. In the **Select a template** list, choose **SiteDefinition1**.

6. Leave the other settings at their default values, and then choose the **Create** button.

     The new site appears.

## Test the new site
 Next, test the new site to verify whether it works correctly.

#### To test the new site

- On the default ASPX page, enter some text, and then choose the **Change Label Text** button next to the text box.

     The text appears in the label on the right side of the button.
