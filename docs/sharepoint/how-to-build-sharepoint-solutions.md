# How to: Build SharePoint Solutions
  Building your SharePoint solution is no different than building other applications in Visual Studio. For more information about building applications, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio). For a discussion of some considerations that are specific to SharePoint solutions, see [How to: Deploy and Publish a SharePoint Solution to a Local SharePoint Site](../sharepoint/how-to-deploy-and-publish-a-sharepoint-solution-to-a-local-sharepoint-site.md).  
  
### To build SharePoint solutions  
  
1.  Decide whether you are making a debug or a release build. For more information, see [Debugger Project Settings](/visualstudio/debugger/debugger-project-settings).  
  
2.  Choose the appropriate option for building or rebuilding your solution or project. For more information, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio).  
  
3.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Build Solution**.
