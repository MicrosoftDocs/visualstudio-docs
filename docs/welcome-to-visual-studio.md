# Welcome to Visual Studio 2017!
We've got everything you need to create great apps for devices or desktop apps, for the web and in the cloud. Write code for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and others in one integrated development environment (IDE). Get great interactive code help (*IntelliSense*), easy code navigation and debugging, fast builds, and quick deployment. Visual Studio increases your productivity and makes it easy to do your work alone or as part of a larger team.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Click here for release notes for [Visual Studio 2017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834799).    


 Download [Visual Studio Community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517106) for free to start coding right away. If you want to do cross-platform development, make sure to install the optional packages. If you need more features, check out [other editions of Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com).

 You can install Visual Studio 2017 by downloading it from [Visual Studio Downloads](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx). To learn more about the installation process, see [Installing Visual Studio 2017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=833223). Jump right in, create a new project, or open a code file, and start writing code. Choose the type of app you want to create. Or you can [take a tour](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=833058) of the Visual Studio IDE to get more familiar with the tools.

 And don't forget to explore our [code gallery](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/) to find samples to help you write your app more quickly! Check out the many free Visual Studio videos available on [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/VisualStudio) and [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/product-training/visual-studio-courses#!jobf=Developer&lang=1033).

## Build cross-platform apps and games  
 You can use Visual Studio to build apps and games for Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, and other devices. Learn more about it at [Cross-Platform Mobile Development](cross-platform/cross-platform-mobile-development-in-visual-studio.md).  Universal Windows Apps help you leverage your code across multiple platforms. See [Universal Windows Apps](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/windows-apps) for more information.

 Choose the tools you need based on your app requirements and the language you want to use.  

- [Xamarin for Visual Studio](cross-platform/build-apps-with-native-ui-using-xamarin-in-visual-studio.md): A common code base in C# for all devices.

- [Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova](cross-platform/visual-studio-tools-for-apache-cordova.md): A common code base for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or Typescript.

- [Visual Studio Tools for Unity](cross-platform/visual-studio-tools-for-unity.md): 2D/3D game development in C#.

- [C++ for Cross-Platform Development](cross-platform/visual-cpp-for-cross-platform-mobile-development.md): Shared code libraries and apps in C++.

- [Visual Studio Emulator for Android](cross-platform/visual-studio-emulator-for-android.md): Visual Studio Emulator for Android: Debug and test your Android apps no matter the IDE.

[Create games using Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/game-development/) with game development tools such as DirectX, Unity, Unreal, Cocos, and more.

## Connect your apps to cloud services  
 If you have online account services such as Azure, you can connect to them out of the box by using Connected Services.

- [Azure Mobile Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/mobile-services/)  

- [Azure Storage](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/storage/)  

When you install Visual Studio, you can optionally install the **Azure Development** workload to get Azure SDK for .NET. These tools enable you to connect to Azure services, as well as let you create and manage cloud-powered apps and resources directly from the IDE.

- [HockeyApp](https://www.visualstudio.com/hockey-app/) helps you distribute beta versions, collect live crash reports, and get feedback from real users.

- [Application Insights](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioOnlineApplicationInsights.application-insights) helps you detect and diagnose quality issues in your apps and web services.  Application Insights will also help you understand what your users actually do with your app so you can optimize the user experience.

In addition, you can integrate Office 365 REST APIs into your own app to connect to data stored in the cloud. For more information, see [these samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=o365).

## Write great Web apps with ASP.NET  
 [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core/overview) is a major update to MVC, WebAPI and SignalR, and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  ASP.NET Core has been designed from the ground up to provide you with a lean and composable .NET stack for building modern cloud-based web apps and services.  

## Build, test, and manage your code  

### Check in your code  
 If you work on a team, you need to share the latest versions of the code so everyone on the team is using the same codebase. Visual Studio seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio Team Services or Team Foundation Server to provide version control with [Git](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/overview) or [TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control)](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/overview).

 Use [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) to store your code in the cloud with no maintenance of a local server. Use [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/) if you want to have an on-premises server. Every time you create a code project, you have the option to add it to version control. Learn about which version control system is best for your needs: [Choosing the right version control for your project](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc).  

### Build your app  
 You can [build your app locally](ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio.md) and make sure that it works correctly. Then use the [debugging tools](debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio.md) to fix any issues with your app. Or you can build projects on shared build servers or in the cloud. Automate your build process to build the code that the devs on your team have checked into version control. For example, you can build one or more projects nightly or every time that code is checked in. See [Continuous integration on any platform](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/overview) for more information.

### Test and improve your app  
[Create unit tests](test/unit-test-your-code.md) to improve the quality of your app. These tests can be run every time you check in, and as part of your build.  

Plan, create and run manual and automated tests for your app. Test plans, suites, test cases and your test results are stored in the cloud with Visual Studio Team Services or on-premises with Team Foundation Server. Learn more about [testing the application](test/improve-code-quality.md).  

Diagnose memory and CPU usage and other application-level issues. See [Profiling tools](profiling/profiling-tools.md) for more information.

### Deliver your team's code faster  
 Remove barriers between members of your team and improve collaboration. Go further and automate the release of your app to each stage in your development all the way to production. Monitor your app's performance and availability when live. Collect real-time usage data about how your customers are actually using your app. See [DevOps and Application Lifecycle Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/vsts-tfs-overview) for more details.

## Extend Visual Studio  
Add your own Visual Studio extension to include a tool or script that you often use while coding. You can create custom menu items and tool windows to integrate your own tools into the Visual Studio IDE. You can extend the Visual Studio editor to analyze and fix code, or add a new project type to include just what you need.  

To find the latest version of the Visual Studio Extensibility Tools (VS SDK), see [Visual Studio SDK](extensibility/visual-studio-sdk.md).  

You can use the .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn) to write your own code analyzers and code generators. Find everything you need at [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/Roslyn).  

Find [existing extensions for the VS IDE](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/) created by Microsoft developers as well as our development community.
