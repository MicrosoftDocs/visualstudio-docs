# Develop apps with the Workflow Designer

The Workflow Designer is a visual designer and debugger for the graphical construction and debugging of [Windows Workflow Foundation](/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/index) (WF) applications in Visual Studio. It enables you to compose a composite workflow application, activity library, or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service through the use of templates and activity designers.
