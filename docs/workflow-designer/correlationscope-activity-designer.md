# CorrelationScope Activity Designer

The **CorrelationScope** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity that provides implicit management of child messaging activities using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> object.

## The CorrelationScope activity

The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith%2A> property specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used to manage child messaging activities. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activities contained in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.Body%2A> are configured to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith%2A> property of the containing <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity to perform correlation.

### Use the CorrelationScope Activity Designer

The **CorrelationScope** activity designer can be found in the **Messaging** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab on the left side of the Workflow Designer. Alternatively, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu, or press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**X**.

The **CorrelationScope** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the Workflow Designer surface. This creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity with a default **DisplayName** of CorrelationScope. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> can be edited in the header of the **CorrelationScope** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the **Properties** window.

To specify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used by child messaging activities, select the ellipsis button beside the **CorrelatesWith** field in **Properties** window to display the **Expression Editor** dialog box. This property can also be set on the activity designer surface.

The activities scoped within the correlation are specified by dropping their designers within the **Body** box within the **CorrelationScope** designer.

### The CorrelationScope properties

The following table shows the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. These properties can be edited either in **Properties** window or on the Workflow Designer surface, and often in both.

|Property Name|Required|Usage|
|-|--------------|-|
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A>|False|The optional friendly name of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation> activity.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.CorrelatesWith%2A>|False|Specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> used to manage child messaging activities. If you do not set this property, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> creates an implicit <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> automatically.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope.Body%2A>|False|Specifies the activities within the scope of the correlation.|
