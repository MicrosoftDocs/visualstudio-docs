# FinalState Activity Designer

The <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> designer is used to create a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State> that terminates a state machine instance.

## Using the FinalState Activity Designer

The **FinalState** designer is used to create a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State> that is preconfigured as a terminating state in a state machine. A <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State> that is created using the <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> activity designer has its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.IsFinal%2A> property set to **true**, has no <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.Exit%2A> activity and no transitions originating from it. To use the <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> activity designer to add a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State> activity that is preconfigured as a terminating state in a state machine, drag the **FinalState** activity designer from the **State Machine** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it onto the workflow designer. The <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> activity designer can be dropped onto a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.StateMachine> and transitions added later; or a transition can be created as the <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> activity designer is dropped. For more information on creating transitions, see [Transition](../workflow-designer/transition-activity-designer.md).

### State Activity Properties in the Workflow Designer

The following table shows the properties that can be set using the <xref:System.Activities.Core.Presentation.FinalState> designer and describes how they are used in the designer. Some of these properties can be edited in the property grid and some can be edited on the designer surface.

|Property Name|Required|Usage|
|-|--------------|-|
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.DisplayName%2A>|False|Specifies the friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State> activity designer in the header. The default value is **State**. The value can be edited in the property grid or directly on the header of the activity designer. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.DisplayName%2A> is used in the breadcrumb navigation that is displayed at the top of the workflow designer.<br /><br /> Although the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.DisplayName%2A> is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use one.|
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.Entry%2A>|False|Specifies the action that occurs when this state is transitioned to. This value can be set by dragging an activity from the **Toolbox** and dropping it onto the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.State.Entry%2A> section of the state.|
