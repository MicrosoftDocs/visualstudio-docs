# Content Definition Dialog Box

The **Content Definition** dialog box is used in Workflow Designer to configure the **Content** properties of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> activities. For more information about the activity designers that use this box, see the [Send](../workflow-designer/send-activity-designer.md), [Receive](../workflow-designer/receive-activity-designer.md), [ReceiveAndSendReply](../workflow-designer/receiveandsendreply-template-designer.md), and [SendAndReceiveReply](../workflow-designer/sendandreceivereply-template-designer.md) topics.

The following table describes the user interface (UI) elements of the **Initialize Correlation** dialog box:

|UI Element|Description|
|-|-----------------|
|**Message**|Specifies the message content with the **Message data** expression text box and the type by using the **Message type** drop-down list box. By default, the **Content Definition** uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveMessageContent>, which expects a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message> or a message contract type within the workflow service definition.|
|**Parameters**|Click the **Parameters** radio button to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParametersContent>, which expects a data contract. Use the data grid to set a generic collection of <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument> key/value pairs whose values are assigned to variable parameters in the current workflow.|

The **Content Definition** dialog box is used by the **Send**, **Receive**, **ReceiveAndSendReply**, and **SendAndReceiveReply** designers. Accessing them is similar in each case and the Receive case is used here to illustrate the procedure.

The **Receive** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the Workflow Designer surface wherever activities are usually placed. This creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity with a default <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of Receive. Select the **Receive** activity designer and click the ellipsis button next to the (Content) text for the **Content** property in the property grid for the **Content Definition** dialog box to appear.

The content can be specified within the **Message** section for a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveMessageContent> activity or within the **Parameter** section for a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParametersContent> activity.
