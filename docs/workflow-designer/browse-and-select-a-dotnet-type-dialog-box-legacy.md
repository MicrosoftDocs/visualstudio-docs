# Browse and Select a .NET Type Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Browse and Select a .NET Type** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd1_md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../workflow-designer/includes/wfd2_md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflow-designer/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflow-designer/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 In the **Properties** window, when you select properties that take a .NET Framework type in a referenced assembly, an ellipses **[…]** appears at the end of the property's text box. Clicking the **[…]** opens the **Browse and Select a .NET Type** dialog box. In this dialog box, you can pick a type from a tree view of the referenced assemblies. For example, when you are using the Activity Designer, in the **Properties** window, click the **Base Class** ellipses **[…]** to select another base class for an activity from the Referenced Assemblies tree.  
  
 The following table describes the user interface (UI) elements of the **Browse and Select a .NET Type** dialog box.
