# Hierarchies and Selection
When you customize [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], you should understand how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] handles hierarchies such as projects and how it uses selection context to determine what is displayed to the user. This section discusses the concepts of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] hierarchies and selection.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Hierarchies in Visual Studio](../extensibility/hierarchies-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Describes project hierarchies and the general concept of hierarchies.  
  
 [Selection and Currency in the IDE](../extensibility/selection-and-currency-in-the-ide.md)  
 Describes how the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) maintains information about the user's currently active objects and lets VSPackages track currency.  
  
 [Selection Context Objects](../extensibility/selection-context-objects.md)  
 Discusses the model for how you can determine the user's selection context focus on a window.  
  
 [Feedback to the User](../extensibility/feedback-to-the-user.md)  
 Discusses how the available functionality in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is based on the user's current selection context and overall IDE context.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Architecture](../extensibility/project-types-architecture.md)  
 Provides detailed technical information about project types.
