# Create the ATOM feed (VsixFeed) for Visual Studio Private Galleries using VsixUtil

You can use the Visual Studio VSSDK command line utility tool to create an ATOM feed, see [Private galleries](../extensibility/private-galleries.md)  

```csharp
VsixUtil  createVsixFeed 
```

## Syntax

```csharp
VSIXUtil createVsixFeed -source [sourceValue] -output [outputValue]– filename [fileNameValue] -title [titleValue] – recursive – ignoreErrors  
```

## Arguments

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------|
| -source | directory contains the VSIX files.  |
| -output | output directory.  |
| -recursive | includes the current directory and all its subdirectories in a VSIX search operation.  |
| -ignoreErrors | ignore an invalid VSIX item in a VSIX search operation.  |
| -fileName | file name for the VSIX feed.  |
| -title | title for the VSIX feed. |

## Examples 

* Search VSIX files from the location *C:\extensions* and create the feed at location *C:\extensions*. 

    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions 
    ``` 

* Search VSIX files from the location *C:\extensions*, create the feed at location *C:\extensions* and skip the invalid VSIX files (if any). 

    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions -ignoreErrors 
    ```

    This command will not include the invalid VSIX files in the feed.

* Search VSIX files from the location *C:\extensions* and all its subdirectories, then create the feed at the location *C:\extensions*. 

    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions  -recursive 
    ```

* Search VSIX files from the location *C:\extensions* and create the feed name `PreProdFeed` at the location *C:\extensions*.  

    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions -ignoreErrors  -recursive -fileName "PreProdFeed"
    ```

* You can run the tool under the directory where VSIX files are located, and then run the below command to generate the feed at the same location. 

    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed 
    ```

* Create a feed from the local repository, for example, *c:\localExtensionProjectRepo* 
 
    ```csharp
    VsixUtil createVsixFeed –source c:\localExtensionProjectRepo -recursive 
    ```

The install location for the VsixUtil tool is *{VS Install Path}\VSSDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\VsixUtil.exe*. You can also download the latest version of [Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools/) that ships the VSIX Utility.
    

## FAQ

* How can I find the feed location generated by the `VsixUtil createVsixFeed` command? 
    You can find the location of the feed from the output of the command. 

    For example, `VSIX Feed '<OutPutDirectory>\AtomFeed.xml' created successfully. `

* I am getting error code `VsixFeed0001`, what does it mean and how can I fix this?  
    It means the source contains invalid Vsix files, you can either remove the invalid file from the source location or use the argument `-ignoreErrors` to skip the invalid file.
    

## Example of VSIX entry

```xml
<Vsix> 
 <Id></Id> 
 <Version></Version> 
 <References />
 <Rating xsi:nil="true" />
