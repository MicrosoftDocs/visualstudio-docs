# How to: Create the ATOM feed (VsixFeed) for Visual Studio Private Galleries using VsixUtil
You can use the Visual Studio VSSDK command line utility tool to create the Feed.   

```csharp
VsixUtil  createVsixFeed 
```


## Syntax

```csharp
VSIXUtil createVsixFeed -source [sourceValue] -output [outputValue]– filename [fileNameValue] -title [titleValue] – recursive – ignoreErrors  
```

## Arguments

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------|
| -source | directory contains the VSIX files.  |
| -output | output directory.  |
| -recursive | includes the current directory and all its subdirectories in a VSIX search operation.  |
| -ignoreErrors | ignore an invalid VSIX item in a VSIX search operation.  |
| -fileName | file name for the VSIX feed.  |
| -title | title for the VSIX feed. |

## Examples 

* Search VSIX files from the location ```“C:\extensions”``` and create the feed at location ```“C:\extensions”```. 

	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions 
	``` 

* Search VSIX files from the location ```“C:\extensions”```, create the feed at location ```“C:\extensions”``` and skip the invalid VSIX files (if any).  

	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions -ignoreErrors 
	``` 
    This command will not include the invalid VSIX files in the feed. 
 

* Search VSIX files from the location “C:\extensions” and all its subdirectories, then create the feed at the location “C:\extensions”. 

	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions  -recursive 
	``` 

* Search VSIX files from the location ```“C:\extensions”``` and create the feed name ```“PreProdFeed”``` at the location ```“C:\extensions”```.  

	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed -source C:\extensions -output C:\extensions -ignoreErrors  -recursive -fileName “PreProdFeed” 
	```

* You can run the tool under the directory where VSIX files are located, and then run the below command to generate the feed at the same location. 

	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed 
	```

* Create a feed from the local repository, e.g., ```c:\localExtensionProjectRepo``` 
 
	```csharp
	VsixUtil createVsixFeed –source c:\localExtensionProjectRepo -recursive 
	```

## VsixUtil location

* ```
  <VS Install Path>\VSSDK\VisualStudioIntegration\Tools\Bin\ 
  ``` 

* You can download the latest version of Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools that ships the VSIX Utility.                   
    ```
    ".\Microsoft.VSSDK.BuildTools.[version].nupkg\tools\vssdk\bin\VsixUtil.exe" 
    ```

## FAQ

* How can I find the feed location generated by the ```VsixUtil createVsixFeed``` command? 
    You can find the location of the feed from the output of the command. 

    e.g. ```VSIX Feed '<OutPutDirectory>\AtomFeed.xml' created successfully. ```

* I am getting error code ```VsixFeed0001```, what does it mean and how can I fix this?  
    It means the source contains invalid Vsix files, you can either remove the invalid file from the source location or use the argument ```-ignoreErrors``` to skip the invalid file.
