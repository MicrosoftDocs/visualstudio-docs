# Add icons to menu commands
Commands can appear on both menus and toolbars. On toolbars, it is common for a command to be displayed with just an icon (to save space) while on menus a command typically appears with both an icon and text.

 Icons are 16 pixels wide by 16 pixels high and can be either 8-bit color depth (256 colors) or 32-bit color depth (true color). 32-bit color icons are preferred. Icons are typically arranged in a single horizontal row in a single bitmap, although multiple bitmaps are allowed. This bitmap is declared in the *.vsct* file along with the individual icons available in the bitmap. See the reference for the [Bitmaps element](../extensibility/bitmaps-element.md) for more details.

## Add an icon to a command
 The following procedure assumes that you have an existing VSPackage project with a menu command. To find out how to do this, see [Create an extension with a menu command](../extensibility/creating-an-extension-with-a-menu-command.md).

1. Create a bitmap with a color depth of 32-bits. An icon is always 16 x 16 so this bitmap must be 16 pixels high and a multiple of 16 pixels wide.

     Each icon is placed on the bitmap next to each other in a single row. Use the alpha channel to indicate places of transparency in each icon.

     If you use an 8-bit color depth, use magenta, `RGB(255,0,255)`, as the transparency. However, 32-bit color icons are preferred.

2. Copy the icon file to the *Resources* directory in your VSPackage project. In the **Solution Explorer**, add the icon to the project. (Select **Resources**, and on the context menu click **Add**, then **Existing Item**, and select your icon file.)

3. Open the *.vsct* file in the editor.

4. Add a `GuidSymbol` element with a name of **testIcon**. Create a GUID (**Tools** > **Create GUID**, then select **Registry Format** and click **Copy**) and paste it into the `value` attribute. The result should look like this:

    ```xml
    <!-- Create your own GUID -->
    <GuidSymbol name="testIcon" value="{00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000}">
    ```

5. Add an `<IDSymbol>` for the icon. The `name` attribute is the icon's ID, and the `value` indicates its position on the strip, if any. If there is just one icon, add 1. The result should look like this:

    ```xml
    <!-- Create your own GUID -->
    <GuidSymbol name="testIcon" value="{00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000}">
        <IDSymbol name="testIcon1" value="1" />
    </GuidSymbol>
    ```

6. Create a `<Bitmap>` in the `<Bitmaps>` section of the *.vsct* file to represent the bitmap containing the icons.

    - Set the `guid` value to the name of the `<GuidSymbol>` element you created in the previous step.

    - Set the `href` value to the relative path of the bitmap file (in this case **Resources\\<icon file name\>**.

    - Set the `usedList` value to the IDSymbol you created earlier. This attribute specifies a comma-delimited list of the icons to be used in the VSPackage. Icons not on the list are excluded form compilation.

         The Bitmap block should look like this:

        ```xml
        <Bitmap guid="testIcon" href="Resources\<icon file name>" usedList="testIcon1"/>
        ```

7. In the existing `<Button>` element, set the `Icon` element to the GUIDSymbol and IDSymbol values you created earlier. Here's an example of a Button element with those values:

    ```xml
    <Button guid="guidAddIconCmdSet" id="cmdidMyCommand" priority="0x0100" type="Button">
        <Parent guid="guidAddIconCmdSet" id="MyMenuGroup" />
        <Icon guid="testIcon" id="testIcon1" />
        <Strings>
            <ButtonText>My Command name</ButtonText>
        </Strings>
    </Button>
    ```

8. Test your icon. Build the project and start debugging. In the experimental instance, find the command. It should show the icon you added.
