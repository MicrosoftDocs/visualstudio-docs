# How to: Create an Atom feed for a private gallery
You can create an Atom (RSS) feed to an intranet location that contains extensions and add the feed to **Extensions and Updates** as a private gallery. For more information, see [Private galleries](../extensibility/private-galleries.md).

## Create an Atom feed
 To create an Atom feed as a private gallery, you first gather your extensions (*.vsix* files) into a folder. You can organize them into subfolders if you want. You will also need the following resources:

- An *atom.xml* file that makes the extensions available as a private gallery. For information about how to connect the *atom.xml* file to **Extensions and Updates**, see [Private galleries](../extensibility/private-galleries.md).

- A folder that contains any image files that were extracted from the extensions (for example, screen shots). The *atom.xml* file contains relative links to these images so that they are available in **Extensions and Updates**.

  For example, assume that you have gathered the following two extensions into a folder:

- *Template_Wizard_239.vsix*, which is an empty VSIX project template.

- *SelectionHighlight.vsix*, which is a tool to highlight all instances of a selected word.

  The contents of the *atom.xml* file would resemble the following example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <title type="text" />
  <id>uuid:bcecded5-97c8-4d24-96f1-7d9e16652433;id=1</id>

    <title type="text">Highlight all occurrences of selected word</title>
    <summary type="text">This extends the editor to highlight ....</summary>

```

 Notice that the two link tags refer to screen shots in the generated folder of images.
