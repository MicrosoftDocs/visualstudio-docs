# Extend solutions
A solution is a grouping of one or more projects that work together to create an application.

## In this section
 The following walkthroughs show some ways in which you can extend solutions.

1. [Extend the Solution Explorer filter](../extensibility/extending-the-solution-explorer-filter.md) explains how to filter what the Solution Explorer displays.
