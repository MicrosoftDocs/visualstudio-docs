# SccInitialize Function
This function initializes the source control plug-in and provides capabilities and limits to the integrated development environment (IDE).

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccInitialize (
   LPVOID* ppvContext,
   HWND    hWnd,
   LPCSTR  lpCallerName,
   LPSTR   lpSccName,
   LPLONG  lpSccCaps,
   LPSTR   lpAuxPathLabel,
   LPLONG  pnCheckoutCommentLen,
   LPLONG  pnCommentLen
);
```

#### Parameters
 `ppvContext`

[in] The source control plug-in can place a pointer to its context structure here.

 `hWnd`

[in] A handle to the IDE window that the source control plug-in can use as a parent for any dialog boxes that it provides.

 `lpCallerName`

[in] The name of the program calling the source control plug-in.

 `lpSccName`

[in, out] The buffer where the source control plug-in puts its own name (not to exceed `SCC_NAME_LEN`).

 `lpSccCaps`

[out] Returns the source control plug-in's capability flags.

 `lpAuxPathLabel`

[in, out] The buffer where the source control plug-in puts a string that describes the `lpAuxProjPath` parameter returned by the [SccOpenProject](../extensibility/sccopenproject-function.md) and the [SccGetProjPath](../extensibility/sccgetprojpath-function.md) (not to exceed `SCC_AUXLABEL_LEN`).

 `pnCheckoutCommentLen`

[out] Returns the maximum permissible length for a checkout comment.

 `pnCommentLen`

[out] Returns the maximum permissible length for other comments.

## Return Value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|Source control initialization succeeded.|
|SCC_E_INITIALIZEFAILED|System could not be initialized.|
|SCC_E_NOTAUTHORIZED|The user is not allowed to perform the specified operation.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECFICERROR|Nonspecific failure; source control system was not initialized.|

## Remarks
 The IDE calls this function when it first loads the source control plug-in. It enables the IDE to pass certain information, such as the caller name, to the plug-in. The IDE also gets back certain information such as the maximum allowable length for comments and the plug-in's capabilities.

 The `ppvContext` points to a `NULL` pointer. The source control plug-in can allocate a structure for its own use and store a pointer to that structure in `ppvContext`. The IDE will pass this pointer to every other VSSCI API function, allowing the plug-in to have context information available without resorting to global storage and to support multiple instances of the plug-in. This structure should be deallocated when the [SccUninitialize](../extensibility/sccuninitialize-function.md) is called.

 The `lpCallerName` and `lpSccName` parameters enable the IDE and the source control plug-in to exchange names. These names may be used simply to distinguish among multiple instances, or they may actually appear in menus or dialog boxes.

 The `lpAuxPathLabel` parameter is a string used as a comment to identify the auxiliary project path that is stored in the solution file and passed to the source control plug-in in a call to the [SccOpenProject](../extensibility/sccopenproject-function.md). [!INCLUDE[vsvss](../extensibility/includes/vsvss_md.md)] uses the string "SourceSafe Project:"; other source control plug-ins should refrain from using this particular string.

 The `lpSccCaps` parameter gives the source control plug-in a place to store bitflags indicating the plug-in's capabilities. (For a full list of capability bitflags, see [Capability Flags](../extensibility/capability-flags.md)). For instance, if the plug-in plans to write results into a caller-provided callback function, the plug-in would set the capability bit SCC_CAP_TEXTOUT. This would signal the IDE to create a window for version control results.
