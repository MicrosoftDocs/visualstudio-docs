# SccPopulateList Function
This function updates a list of files for a particular source control command and supplies source control status on all given files.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccPopulateList (
   LPVOID          pvContext,
   enum SCCCOMMAND nCommand,
   LONG            nFiles,
   LPCSTR*         lpFileNames,
   POPLISTFUNC     pfnPopulate,
   LPVOID          pvCallerData,
   LPLONG          lpStatus,
   LONG            fOptions
);
```

#### Parameters
 pvContext

[in] The source control plug-in context structure.

 nCommand

[in] The source control command that will be applied to all files in the `lpFileNames` array (see [Command Code](../extensibility/command-code-enumerator.md) for a list of possible commands).

 nFiles

[in] Number of files in the `lpFileNames` array.

 lpFileNames

[in] An array of file names known to the IDE.

 pfnPopulate

[in] The IDE callback function to call to add and remove files (see [POPLISTFUNC](../extensibility/poplistfunc.md) for details).

 pvCallerData

[in] Value that is to be passed unchanged to the callback function.

 lpStatus

[in, out] An array for the source control plug-in to return the status flags for each file.

 fOptions

[in] Command flags (see the "PopulateList flag" section of [Bitflags Used by Specific Commands](../extensibility/bitflags-used-by-specific-commands.md) for details).

## Return Value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|Success.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECIFICERROR|Nonspecific failure.|

## Remarks
 This function examines the list of files for its current status. It uses the `pfnPopulate` callback function to notify the caller when a file does not match the criteria for the `nCommand`. For example, if the command is `SCC_COMMAND_CHECKIN` and a file in the list is not checked out, then the callback is used to inform the caller. Occasionally, the source control plug-in may find other files that could be part of the command and add them. This allows, for example, a Visual Basic user to check out a .bmp file that is used by his or her project but does not appear in the Visual Basic project file. A user chooses the **Get** command in the IDE. The IDE will display a list of all files that it thinks the user can get, but before the list is shown, the `SccPopulateList` function is called to make sure the list to be displayed is up to date.

## Example
 The IDE builds a list of files that it thinks the user can get. Before it displays this list, it calls the `SccPopulateList` function, giving the source control plug-in the opportunity to add and delete files from the list. The plug-in modifies the list by calling the given callback function (see [POPLISTFUNC](../extensibility/poplistfunc.md) for more details).

 The plug-in continues to call the `pfnPopulate` function, which adds and deletes files, until it is finished and then returns from the `SccPopulateList` function. The IDE can then display its list. The `lpStatus` array represents all files in the original list passed in by the IDE. The plug-in fills in the status of all these files in addition to making use of the callback function.

> [!NOTE]
> A source control plug-in always has the option to simply return immediately from this function, leaving the list as it is. If a plug-in implements this function, it can indicate this by setting the `SCC_CAP_POPULATELIST` capability bitflag in the first call to the [SccInitialize](../extensibility/sccinitialize-function.md). By default, the plug-in should always assume that all items being passed in are files. However, if the IDE sets the `SCC_PL_DIR` flag in the `fOptions` parameter, all the items being passed in are to be considered directories. The plug-in should add all the files that belong in the directories. The IDE will never pass in a mixture of files and directories.
