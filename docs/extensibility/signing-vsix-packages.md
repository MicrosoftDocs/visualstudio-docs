# Signing VSIX Packages

Extension assemblies do not need to be signed before they can run in Visual Studio, but it is a good practice to do so.

Adding a digital signature to a VSIX package secures your extension and prevents tampering. During install, the VSIX installer will display the signature and a link to the certificate. If the contents of the VSIX are modified without signing again the VSIX installer will mark the signature as invalid. Invalid signatures do not block installing extensions, but the user is warned.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beginning with Visual Studio 2015, VSIX packages signed using anything other than SHA256 encryption will be identified as having an invalid signature. VSIX installation is not blocked but the user will be warned.

## Signing a VSIX with Dotnet Sign
VSIXSignTool has been integrated into [Dotnet/Sign (github.com)](https://github.com/dotnet/sign) and is now accessible as a dotnet tool. This tool is published to NuGet package as [Sign (nuget.org)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sign) and can be used for local or cloud signing using Azure Key Vault.

Sign supports certificates and private keys stored in any combination of these locations:
- `PFX`, `P7B`, or `CER` files
- Imported into Windows Certificate Manager
- Stored in a USB device with access via a Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP)

#### Installing Dotnet Sign
1. Open a [Developer PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022) instance.

1. Verify nuget.org is added and enabled as a NuGet source.
    - Check your sources using `dotnet nuget list source` 
    - Add NuGet.org as a source using `dotnet nuget add source -n NuGet.org https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`

1. Install Sign by running `dotnet tool install sign --version <version> --global`, where `<version>` is the latest available version under [Sign (nuget.org)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sign)
    - `--global` is optional but will allow using sign outside of the PowerShell instance.


#### Using Dotnet Sign
Once installed, Sign can be accessed in a Developer Powershell instance using `sign code <command> <options>`. For a breakdown of the options see 

- Signing using a PFX file with certificate and private key:
```shell
sign code certificate-store -s f5ec6169345347a7cd2f83af662970d5d0bfc914  -cf "D:\Certs\f5ec6169345347a7cd2f83af662970d5d0bfc914.pfx" -d "VSIX Signature" -u "http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com/" "C:\Users\Contoso\Downloads\FingerSnapper2022.vsix"
```
##### Note: PFX files contain both certificate and private key used for signing and do not comply with C/A Browser Forum requiements for non-EV and EV signing. It is recommended to only use private keys stored in an HSM device.

- Signing using Microsoft Certificate Manager:
```shell
code certificate-store -s f5ec6169345347a7cd2f83af662970d5d0bfc914 -csp "Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider" -d "VSIX Signature" -u "http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com/" "C:\Users\Contoso\Downloads\FingerSnapper2022.vsix"
```

- Signing using a private key in a USB drive:
```shell
code certificate-store -s f5ec6169345347a7cd2f83af662970d5d0bfc914 -csp "eToken Base Cryptographic Provider" -d "VSIX Signature" -u "http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com/" "C:\Users\Contoso\Downloads\FingerSnapper2022.vsix"
```

- Signing using a USB drive using a specific key container:
```shell
code certificate-store -s f5ec6169345347a7cd2f83af662970d5d0bfc914 -csp "eToken Base Cryptographic Provider" -k "NuGet Signing.629c9149345347cd2f83af6f5ec70d5d0a7bf616" -d "VSIX Signature" -u "http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com/" "C:\Users\Contoso\Downloads\FingerSnapper2022.vsix"
```
