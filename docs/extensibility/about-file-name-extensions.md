# About file name extensions
When you register a file extension of a VSPackage, you associate it with a version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. This is important if more than one version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is installed on a computer.

 File extensions for VSPackages are registered under **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** key with a default value that points to the associated programmatic identifier (ProgID).

 The following example shows registration information for the *.vcproj* file extension:

```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\
   .vcproj\
      (default)=" VisualStudio.vcproj.8.0"
```

 Files associated with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] must have a versioned ProgID, such as `VisualStudio.vcproj.8.0`. A versioned ProgID allows side-by-side installations of the product to maintain file extension associations among product versions. A version-specific ProgID also allows you to use standard verbs, such as open, edit, and so on, without the concern of overwriting or being overwritten by other applications or versions of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

 In certain cases, the ProgID associated with a file extension should not be changed. For example, the ProgID for the *.htm* file extension (progid = htmlfile) is hard-coded in a number of places in the operating system, and is widely known and used in association with *.htm* and *.html* files.
