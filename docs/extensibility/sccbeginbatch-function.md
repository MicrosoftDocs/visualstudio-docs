# SccBeginBatch function
This function starts a batch sequence of source control operations. The [SccEndBatch](../extensibility/sccendbatch-function.md) will be called to end the batch. These batches may not be nested.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccBeginBatch(void);
```

### Parameters
 None.

## Return value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|Batch of operations successfully began.|
|SCC_E_UNKNOWNERROR|Nonspecific failure.|

## Remarks
 Source control batches are used to execute the same operations across multiple projects or multiple contexts. Batches can be used to eliminate redundant per-project dialog boxes from the user experience during a batched operation. The `SccBeginBatch` function and the [SccEndBatch](../extensibility/sccendbatch-function.md) are used as a function pair to indicate the beginning and end of an operation. They cannot be nested. `SccBeginBatch` sets a flag indicating that a batch operation is in progress.

 While a batch operation is in effect, the source control plug-in should present at most one dialog box for any question to the user and apply the response from that dialog box on all subsequent operations.
