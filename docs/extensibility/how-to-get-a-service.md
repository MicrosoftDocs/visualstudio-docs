# How to: Get a service

You often need to get Visual Studio services to access different features. In general, a Visual Studio service provides one or more interfaces that you can use. You can get most services from a VSPackage.

Any VSPackage that derives from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package> and that has been correctly sited can ask for any global service. Because the `Package` class implements <xref:System.IServiceProvider>, any VSPackage that derives from `Package` is also a service provider.

When Visual Studio loads a <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package>, it passes an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IServiceProvider> object to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage.SetSite%2A> method during initialization. This is called *siting* the VSPackage. The `Package` class wraps this service provider and provides the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetService%2A> method for getting services.

## Getting a service from an initialized VSPackage

1. Every Visual Studio extension starts with a VSIX deployment project, which will contain the extension assets. Create a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] VSIX project named `GetServiceExtension`. You can find the VSIX project template in the **New Project** dialog by searching for "vsix".

2. Now add a custom command item template named **GetServiceCommand**. In the **Add New Item** dialog, go to **Visual C#** > **Extensibility** and select **Custom Command**. In the **Name** field at the bottom of the window, change the command file name to *GetServiceCommand.cs*. For more information about how to create a custom command, [Create an extension with a menu command](../extensibility/creating-an-extension-with-a-menu-command.md)

3. In *GetServiceCommand.cs*, remove the body of the `MenuItemCommand` method and add the following code:

   ```csharp
   IVsActivityLog activityLog = ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(SVsActivityLog)) as IVsActivityLog;
   if (activityLog == null) return;
   System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show("Found the activity log service.");

   ```

    This code gets an SVsActivityLog service and casts it to an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsActivityLog> interface, which can be used to write to the activity log. For an example, see [How to: Use the activity log](../extensibility/how-to-use-the-activity-log.md).

4. Build the project and start debugging. The experimental instance appears.

5. On the **Tools** menu of the experimental instance, find the **Invoke GetServiceCommand** button. When you click this button, you should see a message box that says **Found the activity log service.**

## Getting a service from a tool window or control container

Sometimes you may need to get a service from a tool window or control container that has not been sited, or else has been sited with a service provider that does not know about the service you want. For example, you might want to write to the activity log from within a control.

The static <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService%2A> method relies on a cached service provider that is initialized the first time any VSPackage derived from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package> is sited.

Because the VSPackage constructor is called before the VSPackage is sited, global services are typically unavailable from within the VSPackage constructor. See [How to: Troubleshoot services](../extensibility/how-to-troubleshoot-services.md) for a workaround.

Here's an example of the way to get a service in a tool window or other non-VSPackage element.

```csharp
IVsActivityLog log = Package.GetGlobalService(typeof(SVsActivityLog)) as IVsActivityLog;
if (log == null) return;
```

## Getting a service from the DTE object

You can also get services from <xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass> object. However, you must get the DTE object as a service from a VSPackage or by calling the static <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package.GetGlobalService%2A> method.

The DTE object implements <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IServiceProvider>, which you can use to query for a service by using <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ServiceProvider.GetService%2A>.

Here's how to get a service from the DTE object.

```csharp
// Start with the DTE object, for example:Â 
// using EnvDTE;
// DTE dte = (DTE)GetService(typeof(DTE));

ServiceProvider sp = new ServiceProvider((Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IServiceProvider)dte);
if (sp != null)
{
    IVsActivityLog log = sp.GetService(typeof(SVsActivityLog)) as IVsActivityLog;
    if (log != null)
    {
        System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show("Found the activity log service.");
    }
}
```
