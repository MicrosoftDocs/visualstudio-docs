# TASK_STATE_CANCELED field
The task was canceled before it reached the running state, or it confirmed its cancellation and completed without exception.

 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>

 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)

 Because you can't access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).

## Syntax

```csharp
.field static assembly literal int32 TASK_STATE_CANCELED = int32(0x00800000)
```

## Remarks
 If the [m_stateFlags](../../extensibility/debugger/m-stateflags-field.md) field contains this value, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Status%2A> property returns <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskStatus?displayProperty=fullName>.
