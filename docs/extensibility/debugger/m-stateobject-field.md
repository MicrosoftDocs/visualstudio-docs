# m_stateObject field
An object that represents data that the action will use.

 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>

 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in *mscorlib.dll*)

 Because you can't access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).

## Syntax

```
.field assembly object m_stateObject
```

## Remarks
 This is the `state` parameter in the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.%23ctor%2A> constructor. It is also the backing field for the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.AsyncState%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.
