# Visual Studio debugging samples

Two samples show how to extend the Visual Studio debugger using Visual Studio SDK.

- The Debugger Expression Evaluator Sample, for managed languages, is included in the Visual Studio SDK. In the Visual Studio SDK window, click the **Samples** tab, click **All** or **C#** in the list of languages, and then click **Debugger**.

- The Visual Studio Debug Engine Sample, for native languages, is available on MSDN Code Gallery. For more information, see [Visual Studio debug engine sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Visual%20Studio%20Product%20Team/Visual%20Studio%20Debug%20Engine%20Sample) on the Microsoft Web site.
