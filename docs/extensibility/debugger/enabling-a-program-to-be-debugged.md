# Enable a program to be debugged
Before your debug engine (DE) can debug a program, you must first launch the DE or attach it to an existing program.

## In this section
 [Get a port](../../extensibility/debugger/getting-a-port.md)
 Discusses how to obtain a port as the first step to enabling a program to be debugged.

 [Register the program](../../extensibility/debugger/registering-the-program.md)
 Explains the next step in enabling a program to be debugged: registering it with the port. Once registered, the program can be debugged either by the process of attaching or just-in-time (JIT) debugging.

 [Attach to the program](../../extensibility/debugger/attaching-to-the-program.md)
 Explains the next step: attaching the debugger to the program.

 [Launch-based attaching](../../extensibility/debugger/launch-based-attachment.md)
 Describes launch-based attachment to a program, which is automatic upon launch by the SDM.

 [Send the required events](../../extensibility/debugger/sending-the-required-events.md)
 Steps you through the required events when creating a debug engine (DE) and attaching it to a program.

## Related sections
 [Creating a custom debug engine](../../extensibility/debugger/creating-a-custom-debug-engine.md)
 Defines a debug engine (DE), and describes services implemented through the DE interfaces and how they can cause the debugger to transition between different operational modes.
