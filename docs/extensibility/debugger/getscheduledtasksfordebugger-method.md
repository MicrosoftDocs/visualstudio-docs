# GetScheduledTasksForDebugger Method
Retrieves an array of all scheduled tasks.

 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>

 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in *mscorlib.dll*)

 Because you can't access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).

## Syntax

```csharp
.method assembly hidebysig instance class System.Threading.Tasks.Task[] GetScheduledTasksForDebugger() cil managed
```

## Return Value
 An array of all scheduled tasks. Each task is executing or has finished executing.

## Remarks
 This method is not thread safe and you shouldn't use it concurrently with other instances of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler>. Call this method from a debugger only when the debugger has suspended all other threads.
