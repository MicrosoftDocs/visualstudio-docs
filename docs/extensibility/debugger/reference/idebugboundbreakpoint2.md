# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2
This interface represents a breakpoint that is bound to a code location.

## Syntax

```
IDebugBoundBreakpoint2 : IUnknown
```

## Notes for Implementers
 The debug engine (DE) implements this interface as part of its support for breakpoints.

## Notes for Callers
 A call to [Bind](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-bind.md) creates this interface. Calls to [GetBreakpoint](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2-getbreakpoint.md) and [Next](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/ienumdebugboundbreakpoints2-next.md) can also obtain This interface.
