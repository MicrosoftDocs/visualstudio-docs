# IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Delete
Deletes this pending breakpoint and all breakpoints bound from it.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Delete(
    void
);
```

```csharp
int Delete();
```

## Return Value
If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the breakpoint has been deleted.

## Example
The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CPendingBreakpoint` object that implements the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2.md) interface.

```cpp
HRESULT CPendingBreakpoint::Delete(void)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    // Verify that the pending breakpoint has not been deleted. If deleted,
    // then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.
    if (m_state.state != PBPS_DELETED)
    {
        // If the pending breakpoint has bound and has an associated bound
        // breakpoint, delete and release the bound breakpoint and set the
        // pointer to NULL.
        if (m_pBoundBP)
        {
            m_pBoundBP->Delete();
            m_pBoundBP->Release();
            m_pBoundBP = NULL;
        }
        // If the pending breakpoint did not bind and has an associated
        // error breakpoint, release the error breakpoint and set the
        // pointer to NULL.
        if (m_pErrorBP)
        {
            m_pErrorBP->Release();
            m_pErrorBP = NULL;
        }

        // Set the PENDING_BP_STATE in the PENDING_BP_STATE_INFO structure
        // to deleted.
        m_state.state = PBPS_DELETED;
    }
    else
    {
        hr = E_BP_DELETED;
    }

    return hr;
}
```
