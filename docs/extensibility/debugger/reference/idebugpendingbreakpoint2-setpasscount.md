# IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::SetPassCount
Sets or changes the pass count associated with the pending breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT SetPassCount( 
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount
);
```

```csharp
int SetPassCount( 
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount
);
```

## Parameters
`bpPassCount`\
[in] A [BP_PASSCOUNT](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-passcount.md) structure that contains the pass count.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the breakpoint has been deleted.

## Remarks
 Any pass count that was previously associated with the pending breakpoint is lost. All breakpoints bound from this pending breakpoint are called to set their pass count to the `bpPassCount` parameter.
