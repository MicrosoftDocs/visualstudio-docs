# IDebugAddress2
This interface provides access to the ID of the process that owns the object whose address is represented by this interface.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugAddress2 : IDebugAddress  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 A symbol provider implements this interface on the same object that implements the [IDebugAddress](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugaddress.md) interface. This interface provides access to the ID of the process that owns the object that is related to this address.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 Use [QueryInterface](/cpp/atl/queryinterface) to obtain this interface from the [IDebugAddress](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugaddress.md) interface.  
  
## Methods in vtable Order  
 In addition to the methods inherited from the [IDebugAddress](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugaddress.md) interface, this interface implements the following method:  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetProcessID](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugaddress2-getprocessid.md)|Retrieves the ID of the process that owns the object represented by this interface.|
