# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Delete
Deletes the breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Delete( 
    void 
);
```

```csharp
int Delete();
```

## Return Value
If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Example
The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.

```
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::Delete(void)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been
    // deleted. If deleted, then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.
    if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)
    {
        m_pInterp->RemoveBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);

        // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_DELETED.
        m_state = BPS_DELETED;
        hr = S_OK;
    }
    else
    {
        hr = E_BP_DELETED;
    }

    return hr;
}
```
