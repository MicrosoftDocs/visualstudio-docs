# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::SetPassCount
Sets or changes the pass count associated with this bound breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT SetPassCount( 
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount
);
```

```csharp
int SetPassCount( 
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount
);
```

## Parameters
`bpPassCount`\
[in] The [BP_PASSCOUNT](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-passcount.md) structure that specifies the pass count.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Remarks
 The pass count determines when the breakpoint is fired. The current pass or hit count can be obtained by calling the [GetHitCount](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2-gethitcount.md) method.

 Any pass count that was previously associated with this breakpoint is lost.
