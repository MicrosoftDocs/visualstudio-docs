# IDebugEngine2::CauseBreak
Requests that all programs being debugged by this debug engine (DE) to stop execution the next time one of their threads attempts to run.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT CauseBreak( 
   void 
);
```

```csharp
int CauseBreak();
```

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 This method is asynchronous: an [IDebugBreakEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakevent2.md) event is sent when the program next attempts to execute after this method is called.
