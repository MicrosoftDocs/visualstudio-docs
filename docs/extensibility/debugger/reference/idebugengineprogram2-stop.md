# IDebugEngineProgram2::Stop
Stops all threads running in this program.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Stop( 
   void 
);
```

```csharp
int Stop();
```

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 This method is called when this program is being debugged in a multi-program environment. When a stopping event from some other program is received, this method is called on this program. The implementation of this method should be asynchronous; that is, not all threads should be required to be stopped before this method returns. The implementation of this method may be as simple as calling the [CauseBreak](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-causebreak.md) method on this program.

 Implementers should send an [IDebugStopCompleteEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugstopcompleteevent2.md) when the program stops.
