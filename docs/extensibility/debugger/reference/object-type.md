# OBJECT_TYPE
Specifies the type of an object from the expression evaluator.

## Syntax

```cpp
enum enum_OBJECT_TYPE { 
   OBJECT_TYPE_BOOLEAN = 0x0,
   OBJECT_TYPE_CHAR    = 0x1,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I1      = 0x2,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U1      = 0x3,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I2      = 0x4,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U2      = 0x5,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I4      = 0x6,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U4      = 0x7,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I8      = 0x8,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U8      = 0x9,
   OBJECT_TYPE_R4      = 0xa,
   OBJECT_TYPE_R8      = 0xb,
   OBJECT_TYPE_OBJECT  = 0xc,
   OBJECT_TYPE_NULL    = 0xd,
   OBJECT_TYPE_CLASS   = 0xe
};
typedef DWORD OBJECT_TYPE;
```

```csharp
public enum enum_OBJECT_TYPE { 
   OBJECT_TYPE_BOOLEAN = 0x0,
   OBJECT_TYPE_CHAR    = 0x1,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I1      = 0x2,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U1      = 0x3,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I2      = 0x4,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U2      = 0x5,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I4      = 0x6,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U4      = 0x7,
   OBJECT_TYPE_I8      = 0x8,
   OBJECT_TYPE_U8      = 0x9,
   OBJECT_TYPE_R4      = 0xa,
   OBJECT_TYPE_R8      = 0xb,
   OBJECT_TYPE_OBJECT  = 0xc,
   OBJECT_TYPE_NULL    = 0xd,
   OBJECT_TYPE_CLASS   = 0xe
};
```
