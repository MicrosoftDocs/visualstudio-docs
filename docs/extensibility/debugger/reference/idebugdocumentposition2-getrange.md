# IDebugDocumentPosition2::GetRange
Gets the range for this document position.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT GetRange( 
   TEXT_POSITION* pBegPosition,
   TEXT_POSITION* pEndPosition
);
```

```csharp
int GetRange( 
   TEXT_POSITION[] pBegPosition,
   TEXT_POSITION[] pEndPosition
);
```

## Parameters
`pBegPosition`\
[in, out] A [TEXT_POSITION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/text-position.md) structure that is filled in with the starting position. Set this argument to a null value if this information is not needed.

`pEndPosition`\
[in, out] A [TEXT_POSITION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/text-position.md) structure that is filled in with the ending position. Set this argument to a null value if this information is not needed.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 The range specified in a document position for a location breakpoint is used by the debug engine (DE) to search ahead for a statement that actually contributes code. For example, consider the following code:

```
Line 5: // comment
Line 6: x = 1;
```

 Line 5 contributes no code to the program being debugged. If the debugger that sets the breakpoint on line 5 wants the DE to search forward a certain amount for the first line that contributes code, the debugger would specify a range that includes additional candidate lines where a breakpoint might be properly placed. The DE would then search forward through those lines until it found a line that could accept a breakpoint.
