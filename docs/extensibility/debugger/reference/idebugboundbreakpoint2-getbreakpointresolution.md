# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::GetBreakpointResolution
Gets the breakpoint resolution that describes this breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT GetBreakpointResolution( 
    IDebugBreakpointResolution2** ppBPResolution
);
```

```csharp
int GetBreakpointResolution( 
    out IDebugBreakpointResolution2 ppBPResolution
);
```

## Parameters
`ppBPResolution`\
[out] Returns the [IDebugBreakpointResolution2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointresolution2.md) interface that represents one of the following:

- The breakpoint resolution object that describes the location in code where a code breakpoint has been bound.

- The data location where a data breakpoint has bound.

## Return Value
If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Remarks
Call the [GetBreakpointType](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointresolution2-getbreakpointtype.md) method to determine if the breakpoint resolution is for code or data.

## Example
The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.

```
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::GetBreakpointResolution(
    IDebugBreakpointResolution2** ppBPResolution)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    if (ppBPResolution)
    {
        // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been deleted. If
        // deleted, then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.
        if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)
        {
            // Query for the IDebugBreakpointResolution2 interface.
            hr = m_pBPRes->QueryInterface(IID_IDebugBreakpointResolution2,
                                          (void **)ppBPResolution);
            assert(hr == S_OK);
        }
        else
        {
            hr = E_BP_DELETED;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        hr = E_INVALIDARG;
    }

    return hr;
}
```
