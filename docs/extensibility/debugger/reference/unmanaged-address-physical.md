# UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL
This structure represents a physical address.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct _tagUNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL {
   ULONGLONG offset;
} UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL;
```

```csharp
public struct UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL {
   public ulong offset;
}
```

## Members

 A 64-bit offset into a physical address space.

## Remarks
