# IDebugProgram2::CauseBreak
Requests that the program stop execution the next time one of its threads attempts to run.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT CauseBreak( 
   void 
);
```

```csharp
int CauseBreak();
```

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 An [IDebugBreakEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakevent2.md) event is sent when the program next attempts to run code after this method is called.

 This method is asynchronous in that the method returns immediately without necessarily waiting for the program to stop.
