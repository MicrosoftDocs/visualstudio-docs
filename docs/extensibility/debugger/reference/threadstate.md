# THREADSTATE
Specifies the state of the thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
enum enum_THREADSTATE {   
   THREADSTATE_RUNNING = 0x0001,  
   THREADSTATE_STOPPED = 0x0002,  
   THREADSTATE_FRESH   = 0x0003,  
   THREADSTATE_DEAD    = 0x0004,  
   THREADSTATE_FROZEN  = 0x0005  
};  
typedef DWORD THREADSTATE;  
```  
  
```c#  
public enum enum_THREADSTATE {   
   THREADSTATE_RUNNING = 0x0001,  
   THREADSTATE_STOPPED = 0x0002,  
   THREADSTATE_FRESH   = 0x0003,  
   THREADSTATE_DEAD    = 0x0004,  
   THREADSTATE_FROZEN  = 0x0005  
};  
```
