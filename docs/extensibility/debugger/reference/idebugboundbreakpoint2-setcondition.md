# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::SetCondition
Sets or changes the condition associated with this bound breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT SetCondition( 
   BP_CONDITION bpCondition
);
```

```csharp
int SetCondition( 
   enum_BP_CONDITION bpCondition
);
```

## Parameters
`bpCondition`\
[in] A value from the [BP_CONDITION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-condition.md) enumeration that describes the condition.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Remarks
 Any condition that was previously associated with this breakpoint is lost.
