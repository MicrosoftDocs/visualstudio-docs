# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::SetCondition
Sets or changes the condition associated with this bound breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT SetCondition(   
   BP_CONDITION bpCondition  
);  
```  
  
```c#  
int SetCondition(   
   enum_BP_CONDITION bpCondition  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bpCondition`  
 [in] A value from the [BP_CONDITION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-condition.md) enumeration that describes the condition.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).  
  
## Remarks  
 Any condition that was previously associated with this breakpoint is lost.
