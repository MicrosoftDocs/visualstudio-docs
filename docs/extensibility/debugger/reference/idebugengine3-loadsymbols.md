# IDebugEngine3::LoadSymbols
Loads (as necessary) symbols for all modules being debugged by this debugging engine.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT LoadSymbols();
```

```csharp
int LoadSymbols();
```

## Parameters
 None.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns S_OK; otherwise returns error code.

## Remarks
 This loads debugging symbols for all modules referenced by this debugging engine. The symbols are loaded only if they have not already been loaded. Symbols are searched on the paths set by a call to [SetSymbolPath](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugengine3-setsymbolpath.md).
