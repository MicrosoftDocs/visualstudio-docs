# NATIVE_ADDRESS

This structure represents a native address.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct _tagNATIVE_ADDRESS {
    DWORD unknown;
} NATIVE_ADDRESS;
```

```csharp
public struct NATIVE_ADDRESS {
    public uint unknown;
}
```

## Members

`unknown`\
The native address (the meaning of this depends on the runtime and operating system).

## Remarks

This structure is part of the union in the [DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address-union.md) structure when the `dwKind` field of the `DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION` structure is set to `ADDRESS_KIND_NATIVE` (a value from the [ADDRESS_KIND](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/address-kind.md) enumeration).

## Requirements

Header: sh.h

Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop

Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
