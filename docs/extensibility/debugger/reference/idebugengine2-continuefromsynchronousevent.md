# IDebugEngine2::ContinueFromSynchronousEvent
Called by the session debug manager (SDM) to indicate that a synchronous debug event, previously sent by the debug engine (DE) to the SDM, was received and processed.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT ContinueFromSynchronousEvent(
    IDebugEvent2* pEvent
);
```

```csharp
HRESULT ContinueFromSynchronousEvent(
    IDebugEvent2 pEvent
);
```

## Parameters
`pEvent`\
[in] An [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) object that represents the previously sent synchronous event from which the debugger should now continue.

## Return Value
If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
The DE must verify that it was the source of the event represented by the `pEvent` parameter.

## Example
The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CEngine` object that implements the [IDebugEngine2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugengine2.md) interface.

```cpp
HRESULT CEngine::ContinueFromSynchronousEvent(IDebugEvent2* pEvent)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    // Create a pointer to a unique event interface defined for batch file
    // breaks.
    IAmABatchFileEvent *pBatEvent;
    // Check for successful query for the unique batch file event
    // interface.
    if (SUCCEEDED(pEvent->QueryInterface(IID_IAmABatchFileEvent,
                                        (void **)&pBatEvent)))
    {
        // Release the result of the QI.
        pBatEvent->Release();
        // Check thread message for notification to continue.
        if (PostThreadMessage(GetCurrentThreadId(),
                              WM_CONTINUE_SYNC_EVENT,
                              0,
                              0))
        {
            hr = S_OK;
        }
        else
        {
            hr = HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(GetLastError());
        }
    }
    else
    {
        hr = E_INVALIDARG;
    }
    return hr;
}
```
