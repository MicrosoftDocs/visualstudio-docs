# EVENTATTRIBUTES
Specifies the event attributes.

## Syntax

```cpp
enum enum_EVENTATTRIBUTES {
    EVENT_ASYNCHRONOUS          = 0x0000,
    EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS           = 0x0001,
    EVENT_STOPPING              = 0x0002,
    EVENT_ASYNC_STOP            = 0x0002,
    EVENT_SYNC_STOP             = 0x0003,
    EVENT_IMMEDIATE             = 0x0004,
    EVENT_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION = 0x0008
};
typedef DWORD EVENTATTRIBUTES;
```

```csharp
public enum enum_EVENTATTRIBUTES {
    EVENT_ASYNCHRONOUS          = 0x0000,
    EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS           = 0x0001,
    EVENT_STOPPING              = 0x0002,
    EVENT_ASYNC_STOP            = 0x0002,
    EVENT_SYNC_STOP             = 0x0003,
    EVENT_IMMEDIATE             = 0x0004,
    EVENT_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION = 0x0008
};
```

## Fields
`EVENT_ASYNCHRONOUS`\
Indicates that the event is asynchronous and no reply to the event is needed.

`EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS`\
Indicates that the event is synchronous; reply by means of [ContinueFromSynchronousEvent](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugengine2-continuefromsynchronousevent.md).

`EVENT_STOPPING`\
Indicates that this is a stopping event. Must be combined with either `EVENT_ASYNCHRONOUS` or `EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS`.

`EVENT_ASYNC_STOP`\
Indicates an asynchronous stopping event. There is currently no such event. This flag is only a placeholder.

`EVENT_SYNC_STOP`\
Indicates a synchronous stopping event (a combination of `EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS` and `EVENT_STOPPING`). This value is used by a debug engine (DE) when it sends a stopping event. The reply is made by means of a call to [Execute](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-execute.md), [Step](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-step.md), or [Continue](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-continue.md).

`EVENT_IMMEDIATE`\
Indicates an event that is sent immediately and synchronously to the IDE. This flag is combined with other flags like `EVENT_ASYNCHRONOUS`, `EVENT_SYNCHRONOUS`, or `EVENT_SYNC_STOP` to indicate the type of event and the fact that the reply mechanism (if any) is known.

`EVENT_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION`\
The event is a result of expression evaluation.

## Remarks
These values are passed in the `dwAttrib` parameter of the [Event](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2-event.md) method.

These values may be combined with a bitwise `OR`.

## Requirements
Header: msdbg.h
