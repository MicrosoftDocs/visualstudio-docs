# IDebugPropertyDestroyEvent2
This interface is sent by the debug engine (DE) to the session debug manager (SDM) when a property that is associated with a specific document is about to be destroyed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugPropertyDestroyEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The DE implements this interface to report that a property has been destroyed. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface. The SDM uses [QueryInterface](/cpp/atl/queryinterface) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface. This interface is implemented if the DE has previously created a property associated with a script; destroying the property removes the associated script from the IDE.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object to report a property has been destroyed. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function that is supplied by the SDM when it is attached to the program being debugged.
