# IDebugPointerObject::SetBytes
Sets the value pointed to from a series of consecutive bytes.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT SetBytes(Â 
   DWORD  dwStart,
   DWORD  dwCount,
   BYTE*  pBytes,
   DWORD* pdwBytes
);
```

```csharp
int SetBytes(
   uint     dwStart,
   uint     dwCount,
   byte[]   pBytes,
   out uint pdwBytes
);
```

## Parameters
`dwStart`\
[in] An offset, in bytes, from the start of the object pointed to.

`dwCount`\
[in] The number of bytes to set.

`pBytes`\
[in] An array of bytes representing the new value. This value is stored into the object, starting at the given offset.

`pdwBytes`\
[out] Returns the number of bytes actually set.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns S_OK; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 This method is used if the pointer as represented by this [IDebugPointerObject](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpointerobject.md) points to a primitive type or a simple array of primitive types (that is, an array that can be represented by a simple sequence of bytes). This `IDebugPointerObject` object cannot be a null reference (it must point to an address in memory).
