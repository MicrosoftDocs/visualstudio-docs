# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Enable
Enables or disables the breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Enable(
    BOOL fEnable
);
```

```csharp
int Enable(Â 
    int fEnable
);
```

## Parameters
`fEnable`\
[in] Set to non-zero (`TRUE`) to enable or to zero (`FALSE`) to disable the breakpoint.

## Return Value
If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Example
The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.

```
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::Enable(BOOL fEnable)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been deleted. If deleted,
    // then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.
    if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)
    {
        // Check the state of the bound breakpoint. If the breakpoint is
        // supposed to be, but has not already been, enabled, then have the
        // interpreter set the breakpoint.
        if (fEnable && m_state != BPS_ENABLED)
        {
            hr = m_pInterp->SetBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);
            if (hr == S_OK)
            {
                // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_ENABLED.
                m_state = BPS_ENABLED;
            }
        }
        // Check the state of the bound breakpoint. If the breakpoint is
        // supposed to be, but has not already been, disabled, then have the
        // interpreter remove the breakpoint.
        else if (!fEnable && m_state != BPS_DISABLED)
        {
            hr = m_pInterp->RemoveBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);
            if (hr == S_OK)
            {
                // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_DISABLED.
                m_state = BPS_DISABLED;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            hr = S_FALSE;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        hr = E_BP_DELETED;
    }

    return hr;
}
```
