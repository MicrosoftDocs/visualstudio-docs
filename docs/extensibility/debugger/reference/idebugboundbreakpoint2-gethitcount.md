# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::GetHitCount
Gets the current hit count for this bound breakpoint.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT GetHitCount( 
   DWORD* pdwHitCount
);
```

```csharp
int GetHitCount( 
   out uint pdwHitCount
);
```

## Parameters
`pdwHitCount`\
[out] Returns the hit count.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).

## Remarks
 The hit count is the number of times this breakpoint has fired during the current run of the session.
