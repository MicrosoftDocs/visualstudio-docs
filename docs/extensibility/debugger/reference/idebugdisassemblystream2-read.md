# IDebugDisassemblyStream2::Read
Reads instructions starting from the current position in the disassembly stream.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Read( 
   DWORD                     dwInstructions,
   DISASSEMBLY_STREAM_FIELDS dwFields,
   DWORD*                    pdwInstructionsRead,
   DisassemblyData*          prgDisassembly
);
```

```csharp
int Read( 
   uint                           dwInstructions,
   enum_DISASSEMBLY_STREAM_FIELDS dwFields,
   out uint                       pdwInstructionsRead,
   DisassemblyData[]              prgDisassembly
);
```

## Parameters
`dwInstructions`\
[in] The number of instructions to disassemble. This value is also the maximum length of the `prgDisassembly` array.

`dwFields`\
[in] A combination of flags from the [DISASSEMBLY_STREAM_FIELDS](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/disassembly-stream-fields.md) enumeration that indicate which fields of `prgDisassembly` are to be filled out.

`pdwInstructionsRead`\
[out] Returns the number of instructions actually disassembled.

`prgDisassembly`\
[out] An array of [DisassemblyData](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/disassemblydata.md) structures that is filled in with the disassembled code, one structure per disassembled instruction. The length of this array is dictated by the `dwInstructions` parameter.

## Return Value
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.

## Remarks
 The maximum number of instructions that are available in the current scope can be obtained by calling the [GetSize](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugdisassemblystream2-getsize.md) method.

 The current position where the next instruction is read from can be changed by calling the [Seek](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugdisassemblystream2-seek.md) method.

 The `DSF_OPERANDS_SYMBOLS` flag can be added to the `DSF_OPERANDS` flag in the `dwFields` parameter to indicate that symbol names should be used when disassembling instructions.
