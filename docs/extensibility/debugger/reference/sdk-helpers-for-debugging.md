# SDK Helpers for Debugging
These functions and declarations are global helper functions for implementing debug engines, expression evaluators, and symbol providers in C++.

> [!NOTE]
> There are no managed versions of these functions and declarations at this time.

## Overview
 In order for debug engines, expression evaluators, and symbol providers to be used by Visual Studio, they must be registered. This is done by setting registry subkeys and entries, otherwise known as "setting metrics." The following global functions are designed to ease the process of updating these metrics. See the section on Registry Locations to find out the layout of each registry subkey that is updated by these functions.

## General Metric Functions
 These are general functions used by debug engines. Specialized functions for expression evaluators and symbol providers are detailed later.

### GetMetric Method
 Retrieves a metric value from the registry.

```cpp
HRESULT GetMetric(
   LPCWSTR pszMachine,
   LPCWSTR pszType,
   REFGUID guidSection,
   LPCWSTR pszMetric,
   DWORD * pdwValue,
   LPCWSTR pszAltRoot
);
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|pszMachine|[in] Name of a possibly remote machine whose register will be written (`NULL` means local machine).|
|pszType|[in] One of the metric types.|
|guidSection|[in] GUID of a specific engine, evaluator, exception, etc. This specifies a subsection under a metric type for a specific element.|
|pszMetric|[in] The metric to be obtained. This corresponds to a specific value name.|
|pdwValue|[in] The storage location of the value from the metric. There are several flavors of GetMetric that can return a DWORD (as in this example), a BSTR, a GUID, or an array of GUIDs.|
|pszAltRoot|[in] An alternate registry root to use. Set to `NULL` to use the default.|

### SetMetric Method
 Sets the specified metric value in the registry.

```cpp
HRESULT SetMetric(
         LPCWSTR pszType,
         REFGUID guidSection,
         LPCWSTR pszMetric,
   const DWORD   dwValue,
         bool    fUserSpecific,
         LPCWSTR pszAltRoot
);
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|pszType|[in] One of the metric types.|
|guidSection|[in] GUID of a specific engine, evaluator, exception, etc. This specifies a subsection under a metric type for a specific element.|
|pszMetric|[in] The metric to be obtained. This corresponds to a specific value name.|
|dwValue|[in] The storage location of the value in the metric. There are several flavors of SetMetric that can store a DWORD (in this example), a BSTR, a GUID, or an array of GUIDs.|
|fUserSpecific|[in] TRUE if the metric is user-specific and if it should be written to the user's hive instead of the local machine hive.|
|pszAltRoot|[in] An alternate registry root to use. Set to `NULL` to use the default.|

### RemoveMetric Method
 Removes the specified metric from the registry.

```cpp
HRESULT RemoveMetric(
   LPCWSTR pszType,
   REFGUID guidSection,
   LPCWSTR pszMetric,
   LPCWSTR pszAltRoot
);
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|pszType|[in] One of the metric types.|
|guidSection|[in] GUID of a specific engine, evaluator, exception, etc. This specifies a subsection under a metric type for a specific element.|
|pszMetric|[in] The metric to be removed. This corresponds to a specific value name.|
|pszAltRoot|[in] An alternate registry root to use. Set to `NULL` to use the default.|

### EnumMetricSections Method
 Enumerates the various metric sections in the registry.

```cpp
HRESULT EnumMetricSections(
   LPCWSTR pszMachine,
   LPCWSTR pszType,
   GUID *  rgguidSections,
   DWORD * pdwSize,
   LPCWSTR pszAltRoot
);
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|pszMachine|[in] Name of a possibly remote machine whose register will be written (`NULL` means local machine).|
|pszType|[in] One of the metric types.|
|rgguidSections|[in, out] Preallocated array of GUIDs to be filled in.|
|pdwSize|[in] The maximum number of GUIDs that can be stored in the `rgguidSections` array.|

## Registry Locations
 The metrics are read from and written to the registry, specifically in the `VisualStudio` subkey.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the time, the metrics will be written to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key. However, sometimes HKEY_CURRENT_USER will be the destination key. Dbgmetric.lib handles both keys. When getting a metric, it searches HKEY_CURRENT_USER first, then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. When it is setting a metric, a parameter specifies which top-level key to use.

 *[registry key]*\

 `Software`\

 `Microsoft`\

 `VisualStudio`\

 *[version root]*\

 *[metric root]*\

 *[metric type]*\

 *[metric] = [metric value]*

 *[metric] = [metric value]*

 *[metric] = [metric value]*

|Placeholder|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|*[registry key]*|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.|
|*[version root]*|The version of Visual Studio (for example, `7.0`, `7.1`, or `8.0`). However, this root can also be modified using the **/rootsuffix** switch to **devenv.exe**. For VSIP, this modifier is typically **Exp**, so the version root would be, for example, 8.0Exp.|
|*[metric root]*|This is either `AD7Metrics` or `AD7Metrics(Debug)`, depending on whether the debug version of dbgmetric.lib is used. **Note:**  Whether or not dbgmetric.lib is used, this naming convention should be adhered to if you have differences between debug and release versions that must be reflected in the registry.|
|*[metric type]*|The type of metric to be written: `Engine`, `ExpressionEvaluator`, `SymbolProvider`, etc. These are all defined as in dbgmetric.h as `metricTypeXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the specific type name.|
|*[metric]*|The name of an entry to be assigned a value in order to set the metric. The actual organization of the metrics depends on the metric type.|
|*[metric value]*|The value assigned to the metric. The type the value should have (string, number, etc.) depends on the metric.|

> [!NOTE]
> All GUIDs are stored in the format of `{GUID}`. For example, `{123D150B-FA18-461C-B218-45B3E4589F9B}`.

### Debug Engines
 The following is the organization of the debug engines metrics in the registry. `Engine` is the metric type name for a debug engine and corresponds to *[metric type]* in the above registry subtree.

 The following is the organization of the expression evaluator metrics in the registry. `ExpressionEvaluator` is the metric type name for the expression evaluator and corresponds to *[metric type]*.

> [!NOTE]
> The metric type for `ExpressionEvaluator` is not defined in dbgmetric.h, as it is assumed that all metric changes for expression evaluators will go through the appropriate expression evaluator metric functions (the layout of the `ExpressionEvaluator` subkey is somewhat complicated, so the details are hidden inside dbgmetric.lib).

 `ExpressionEvaluator`\

 *[language guid]*\

 *[vendor guid]*\

 `CLSID` = *[class guid]*

 *[metric] = [metric value]*

|Placeholder|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|*[debug engine guid]*|The GUID of a debug engine that supports exceptions.|
|*[exception types]*|A general title for the subkey identifying the class of exceptions that can be handled. Typical names are **C++ Exceptions**, **Win32 Exceptions**, **Common Language Runtime Exceptions**, and **Native Run-Time Checks**. These names are also used to identify a particular class of exception to the user.|
|*[exception]*|A name for an exception: for example, **_com_error** or **Control-Break**. These names are also used to identify a particular exception to the user.|
