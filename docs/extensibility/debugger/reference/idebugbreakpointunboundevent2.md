# IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2
This interface tells the session debug manager (SDM) that a bound breakpoint has been unbound from a loaded program.

## Syntax

```
IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2 : IUnknown
```

## Notes for Implementers
 The debug engine (DE) implements this interface as part of its support for breakpoints. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface (the SDM uses [QueryInterface](/cpp/atl/queryinterface) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface).

## Notes for Callers
 The DE creates and sends this event object when a bound breakpoint has been unbound. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function supplied by the SDM when it attached to the program being debugged.

## Methods in Vtable Order
 The following table shows the methods of `IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2`.

|Method|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|[GetBreakpoint](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2-getbreakpoint.md)|Gets the breakpoint that became unbound.|
|[GetReason](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2-getreason.md)|Gets the reason the breakpoint was unbound.|

## Remarks
 When a debug engine DLL or class unloads, all breakpoints that were bound to code in that module must be unbound from the program being debugged. An `IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2` is sent for each unbound breakpoint.

## Requirements
 Header: msdbg.h

 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop

 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
