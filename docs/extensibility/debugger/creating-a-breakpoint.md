# Create a breakpoint
The following describes the process of creating a breakpoint.

## Methods in breakpoint creation
 When the module that is needed to bind a breakpoint is loaded, the session debug manager (SDM) calls the following methods:

1. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-enable.md)

2. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Virtualize](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-virtualize.md)

3. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::CanBind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-canbind.md)

    > [!NOTE]
    > **CanBind** is called only when a user makes a breakpoint from the **Breakpoints** window.

4. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Bind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-bind.md)

5. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::EnumBoundBreakpoints](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-enumboundbreakpoints.md)
