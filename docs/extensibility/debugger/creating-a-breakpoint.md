# Creating a Breakpoint
The following describes the process of creating a breakpoint.  
  
## Methods in Breakpoint Creation  
 When the module that is needed to bind a breakpoint is loaded, the session debug manager (SDM) calls the following methods:  
  
1.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-enable.md)  
  
2.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Virtualize](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-virtualize.md)  
  
3.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::CanBind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-canbind.md)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  **CanBind** is called only when a user makes a breakpoint from the Breakpoints window.  
  
4.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Bind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-bind.md)  
  
5.  [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::EnumBoundBreakpoints](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-enumboundbreakpoints.md)
