# File status code enumerator
The `SccStatus` enumerator contains named constant values that specify the state of a file in the source control system. This enumeration is used by the [SccQueryInfo](../extensibility/sccqueryinfo-function.md) and the `POPLISTFUNC` callback function (see [POPLISTFUNC](../extensibility/poplistfunc.md) for details).

## Syntax

```
enum SccStatus {
   SCC_STATUS_INVALID          = -1L,
   SCC_STATUS_NOTCONTROLLED    = 0x0000L,
   SCC_STATUS_CONTROLLED       = 0x0001L,
   SCC_STATUS_CHECKEDOUT       = 0x0002L,
   SCC_STATUS_OUTOTHER         = 0x0004L,
   SCC_STATUS_OUTEXCLUSIVE     = 0x0008L,
   SCC_STATUS_OUTMULTIPLE      = 0x0010L,
   SCC_STATUS_OUTOFDATE        = 0x0020L,
   SCC_STATUS_DELETED          = 0x0040L,
   SCC_STATUS_LOCKED           = 0x0080L,
   SCC_STATUS_MERGED           = 0x0100L,
   SCC_STATUS_SHARED           = 0x0200L,
   SCC_STATUS_PINNED           = 0x0400L,
   SCC_STATUS_MODIFIED         = 0x0800L,
   SCC_STATUS_OUTBYUSER        = 0x1000L
   SCC_STATUS_NOMERGE          = 0x2000L
   SCC_STATUS_RESERVED_1       = 0x4000L
   SCC_STATUS_RESERVED_2       = 0x8000L
};
