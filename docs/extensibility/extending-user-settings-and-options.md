# Extend user settings and options
In Visual Studio there are two main ways to maintain user preferences. The **Tools** > **Options** pages allow users to set their own values for many different kinds of settings, both general and language-specific. User settings allow users to specify general Visual Studio configuration properties. For more information about options pages, see [Options and options pages](../extensibility/internals/options-and-options-pages.md).
