# Supply undo support to designers

Designers, like editors, typically need to support undo operations so that users can reverse their recent changes when modifying a code element.

Most designers implemented in Visual Studio have "undo" support automatically provided by the environment.

Designer implementations that need to provide support for the undo feature:

- Provide undo management by implementing the abstract base class <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.UndoEngine>

- Supply persistence and CodeDOM support by implementing the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.IDesignerSerializationService> and  <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService> classes.

For more information on writing designers using .NET Framework, see [Extend Design-Time Support](/previous-versions/37899azc(v=vs.140)).

The [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] provides a default undo infrastructure by:

- Providing undo management implementations through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine.UndoUnit> classes.

- Supplying persistence and CodeDOM support through the default <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomComponentSerializationService> and <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService> implementations.

## Obtain Undo Support Automatically

Any designer created in Visual Studio has automatic and full undo support if, the designer:

- Makes use of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> based class for its user interface.

- Employs standard CodeDOM-based code generation and parsing system for code generation and persistence.

   For more information about working with Visual Studio CodeDOM support, see [Dynamic Source Code Generation and Compilation](/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-source-code-generation-and-compilation).

## When to Use Explicit Designer Undo Support
 Designers must supply their own undo management if they use a graphical user interface, referred to as a view adapter, other than the one supplied by <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>.

 An example of this might be creating a product with a web-based graphical design interface rather than a .NET Framework-based graphical interface.

 In such cases, one would need to register this view adapter with Visual Studio using <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.ProvideViewAdapterAttribute>, and provide explicit undo management.

 Designers need to provide CodeDOM and persistence support if they do not use the Visual Studio code generation model provided in the <xref:System.CodeDom> name space.

## Undo Support Features of the Designer
 The Environment SDK provides default implementations of interfaces needed to provide undo support that can be used by designers not using <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> based classes for their user interfaces or the standard CodeDOM and persistence model.

 The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine> class derives from the .NET Framework <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.UndoEngine> class using an implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleUndoManager> class to manage undo operations.

 Visual Studio provides the following feature to designer undo:

- Linked undo functionality across multiple designers.

- Child units within a designer can interact with their parents by implementing <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleUndoUnit> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleParentUndoUnit> on <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine.UndoUnit>.

The Environment SDK provides CodeDOM and persistence support by supplying:

- <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomComponentSerializationService> as an implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.IDesignerSerializationService>

- A <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService> provided by the Visual Studio design host.

## Use the Environment SDK Features to Supply Undo Support

To obtain undo support, an object implementing a designer must instantiate and initialize an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine> class with a valid <xref:System.IServiceProvider> implementation. This <xref:System.IServiceProvider> class must provide the following services:

- <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesignerHost>.

- <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.IDesignerSerializationService>

   Designers using Visual Studio CodeDOM serialization may choose to use <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.CodeDomComponentSerializationService> provided with the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] as its implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.IDesignerSerializationService>.

   In this case, the <xref:System.IServiceProvider> class provided to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine> constructor should return this object as an implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.IDesignerSerializationService> class.

- <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService>

   Designers using the default <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignSurface> provided by the Visual Studio design host are guaranteed to have a default implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService> class.

Designers implementing a <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine> based undo mechanism automatically tracks changes if:

- Property changes are made through the <xref:System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor> object.

- <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.IComponentChangeService> events are manually generated when an undoable change is committed.

- Modification on the designer was created within the context of a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerTransaction>.

- The designer chooses to explicitly create undo units using either the standard undo unit provided by an implementation of <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.UndoEngine.UndoUnit> or the Visual Studio-specific implementation <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Design.OleUndoEngine.UndoUnit>, which derives from <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.UndoEngine.UndoUnit> and also provides an implementation of both <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleUndoUnit> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleParentUndoUnit>.
