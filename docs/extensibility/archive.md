# Archive
This section contains discussions of Visual Studio extensibility technologies that are still supported but that have replacement technologies that are newer.  
  
## Legacy Interfaces in the Editor  
 This section explains how to access the editor with legacy (IVs*) interfaces rather than the newer MEF code: [Legacy Interfaces in the Editor](../extensibility/legacy-interfaces-in-the-editor.md).  
  
## Tool Windows in the Registry  
 This section explains how to set up tool windows directly in the registry: [Tool Windows in the Registry](../extensibility/tool-windows-in-the-registry.md).
