# Walkthrough: Create an Extension Pack

An Extension Pack is a set of extensions that can be installed together. Extension Packs enable you to easily share your favorite extensions with other users or bundle a set of extensions together for a particular scenario.

## Prerequisites

Starting in Visual Studio 2015, the Visual Studio SDK is included as an optional feature in Visual Studio setup. You can also install the VS SDK later on. For more information, see [Installing the Visual Studio SDK](../extensibility/installing-the-visual-studio-sdk.md).

The Extension Pack feature is available starting with Visual Studio 15.8 Preview 2.

## Create an extension with an Extension Pack item template

The Extension Pack item template creates an Extension Pack with set of extensions that can be installed together.

1. In the **New Project** dialog, search for "vsix" and select **VSIX Project**. For **Project name**, type "Test Extension Pack". Select **Create**.

2. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project node and select **Add** > **New Item**. Go to the Visual C# **Extensibility** node and select **Extension Pack**. Leave the default file name (ExtensionPack1.cs).

3. ExtensionPack1.vsext file is added which contains the following code

   ```json
   {
    "id": "ExtensionPack1",
    "name": "ExtensionPack1",
    "description": "Read about creating extension packs at https://aka.ms/vsextpack",
    "version": "1.0.0.0",
    "extensions": [  // List of extensions that are included in the Extension Pack.
      {
        "vsixId": "41858b2d-ff0b-4a43-80b0-f1b2d6084935", // The vsix id of the extension you want to   include.
        "name": "AlignAssignments"
      },
      {
          "vsixId": "42374550-426a-400e-96f9-237682e8dea6",
        "name": "CopyAsHtml"
      }
    ]
   }
   ```

4. The vsixid of the extension to include in the Extension Pack can be found on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). Find the extension you want to include and click on **Copy ID**. You can update the existing **vsixId** in the above file or add another extension to the list.

5. Build the project and upload your extension to the Marketplace. See [Publishing a Visual Studio extension](../extensibility/walkthrough-publishing-a-visual-studio-extension.md).

> [!NOTE]
> An Extension pack can only install extensions that are available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) or [Private gallery](../extensibility/how-to-create-an-atom-feed-for-a-private-gallery.md).

## Install the Extension Pack from the Visual Studio Marketplace

Now that the extension is published, install it in Visual Studio and test it there.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

1. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, click **Extensions and Updates**.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

1. In Visual Studio, on the **Extensions** menu, click **Managed Extensions**.

::: moniker-end

2. Click **Online** and then search for "Test Extension Pack".

3. Click **Download**. The extension and its list of extensions included in the Extension Pack will then be scheduled for install.

4. Below is a sample Extension Pack download view of the **Manage Extensions** dialog. If you prefer to install only some of the included extensions in the Extension pack, you can modify the extension list in **Scheduled For Install**.
