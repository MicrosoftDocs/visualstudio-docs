# Source Control VSPackage Features
This section describes the various features of a source control VSPackage. It outlines the registration and selection details for such a VSPackage, and discusses three of the main source control-related features: handling of Query-Edit Query-Save (QEQS) events, glyph replacement, and custom user interface (UI) for the source control functions.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Registration and Selection](../extensibility/registration-and-selection--source-control-vspackage-.md)  
 Describes the package registration and selection mechanisms.  
  
 [Query Edit Query Save](../extensibility/query-edit-query-save--source-control-vspackage-.md)  
 Explains the role of Query-Edit Query-Save events and how they are handled by the source control VSPackage.  
  
 [Glyph Control](../extensibility/glyph-control--source-control-vspackage-.md)  
 Describes the levels of glyph control and how to implement them.  
  
 [Custom User Interface](../extensibility/custom-user-interface--source-control-vspackage-.md)  
 Outlines the UI elements that a source control VSPackage can specify.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Creating a Source Control VSPackage](../extensibility/creating-a-source-control-vspackage.md)  
 Discusses how to create a source control VSPackage that not only supplies source control functionality but can be used to customize the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] source control UI.
