# Legacy Language Service Features
The following topics list some of the legacy language service features you can provide.  
  
 Legacy language services are implemented as part of a VSPackage, but the newer way to implement language service features is to use MEF extensions. To find out more about the new way to implement a language service, see [Editor and Language Service Extensions](../extensibility/editor-and-language-service-extensions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  We recommend that you begin to use the new editor API as soon as possible. This will improve the performance of your language service and let you take advantage of new editor features.
