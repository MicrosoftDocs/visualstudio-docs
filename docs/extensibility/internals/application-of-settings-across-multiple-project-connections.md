# Application of settings across multiple project connections
A source control plug-in built using the Source Control Plug-in API Version 1.2, can use a batch operation to execute the same source control operation across multiple projects or multiple connection contexts. Batches can be used to eliminate redundant, per-project dialog boxes from the user experience.

 If a user selects multiple items that belong to more than one connection in a source control plug-in built using the Source Control Plug-in API Version 1.1 (for example, two web projects on different file-share machines) and checks them out, the user sees the same dialog box repeatedly. This scenario occurs even if the user clicks the **Apply to All** check box in the dialog box, because the IDE resets its state for each connection context.

## New capability flag
 The `SccBeginBatch` function sets the `SCC_CAP_BATCH` flag to indicate that a batch operation is in progress.

## New functions
The following new functions support the batch operation:

- [SccBeginBatch](../../extensibility/sccbeginbatch-function.md)

- [SccEndBatch](../../extensibility/sccendbatch-function.md)

The `SCCBeginBatch` function starts a group of source control operations. The `SccEndBatch` function closes the group. The groups may not be nested.
