# Add directories to the New Project dialog box
When you create new project types, you also can register a new directory in the **New Project** dialog box to display them for use as templates. The following code example explains how to register a new directory, also known as a node. In the example, templates exposed by the VSPackage, *CLSID_Package*, are registered. As a result, the left side of the **New Project** dialog box offers the added node, with a name determined by the *Folder_Label_ResID* resource. This resource is loaded from the VSPackage satellite DLL.

 The **Folder** value represents a GUID of a folder under which the *Folder_Label_ResID* node is displayed. In the example, the GUID represents the **Other Projects** folder in the **Project Types** pane of the **New Project** dialog box. If the **Other Projects** value is absent, the label is positioned at the top level.

 The `TemplatesDir` value specifies the full path of the directory that contains the project templates. These files can be either *.vsz* files or typical template files to be cloned.

 If you specify `TemplatesLocalizedSubDir`, it must be the resource ID of a string that names the subdirectory of `TemplatesDir` that holds localized templates. Because [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] loads the string resource from a satellite DLL if you have one, each satellite DLL can contain a different subdirectory name. The `SortPriority` value specifies a sorting priority.

```
NoRemove NewProjectTemplates
{
    NoRemove TemplateDirs
  {
    ForceRemove %CLSID_Package%
    {
      ForceRemove /1 = s '#%Folder_Label_ResID%'
      {
        val Folder = s '{DCF2A94A-45B0-11D1-ADBF-00C04FB6BE4C}'
        val TemplatesDir = s '%Template_Path%'
        val TemplatesLocalizedSubDir = s '#100'
        val SortPriority = d 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```
