# Expose events in the Visual Studio SDK
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] lets you source events by using automation. We recommend that you source events for projects and project items.

 Events are retrieved by automation consumers from the <xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass.Events%2A> object or <xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass.GetObject%2A> (for example, `GetObject("EventObjectName")`). The environment calls `IDispatch::Invoke` by using the `DISPATCH_METHOD` or `DISPATCH_PROPERTYGET` flags to return an event.

 The following process explains how VSPackage-specific events are returned.

1. The environment starts.

2. It reads from the registry all value names under the **Automation**, **AutomationEvents**, and **AutomationProperties** keys of all VSPackages, and stores those names in a table.

3. An automation consumer calls, in this example, `DTE.Events.AutomationProjectsEvents` or `DTE.Events.AutomationProjectItemsEvents`.

4. The environment finds the string parameter in the table and loads the corresponding VSPackage.

5. The environment calls the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage.GetAutomationObject%2A> method by using the name passed in the call; in this example, `AutomationProjectsEvents` or `AutomationProjectItemsEvents`.

6. The VSPackage creates a root object that has methods such as `get_AutomationProjectsEvents` and `get_AutomationProjectItemEvents` and then returns an IDispatch pointer to the object.

7. The environment calls the appropriate method based on the name passed into the automation call.

8. The `get_` method creates another IDispatch-based event object that implements both the `IConnectionPointContainer` interface and the `IConnectionPoint` interface and returns an `IDispatchpointer` to the object.

   To expose an event by using automation, you must respond to <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage.GetAutomationObject%2A> and watch for the strings that you add to the registry. In the Basic Project sample, the strings are *BscProjectsEvents* and *BscProjectItemsEvents*.

## Registry entries from the Basic Project sample
 This section shows where to add automation event values to the registry.

 **[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Packages\\<PkgGUID\>\AutomationEvents]**

 **AutomationProjectEvents** = Returns the `AutomationProjectEvents` object.

 **AutomationProjectItemEvents** = Returns the `AutomationProjectItemsEvents` object.

|Name|Type|Range|Description|
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
|Default (@)|REG_SZ|Unused|Unused. You can use the data field for documentation.|
|*AutomationProjectsEvents*|REG_SZ|Name of your event object.|Only the key name is relevant. You can use the data field for documentation.<br /><br /> This example comes from the Basic Project sample.|
|*AutomationProjectItemEvents*|REG_SZ|Name of your event object|Only the key name is relevant. You can use the data field for documentation.<br /><br /> This example comes from the Basic Project sample.|

 When any of your event objects are requested by an automation consumer, create a root object that has methods for any event that your VSPackage supports. The environment calls the appropriate `get_` method on this object. For example, if `DTE.Events.AutomationProjectsEvents` is called, the `get_AutomationProjectsEvents` method on the root object is invoked.

 ![Visual Studio project events](../../extensibility/internals/media/projectevents.gif "ProjectEvents")
Automation model for events

 The class `CProjectEventsContainer` represents the source object for *BscProjectsEvents*, and `CProjectItemsEventsContainer` represents the source object for *BscProjectItemsEvents*.

 In most cases, you must return a new object for every event request because most event objects take a filter object. When you fire your event, check this filter to verify that the event handler is being called.

 *AutomationEvents.h* and *AutomationEvents.cpp* contain declarations and implementations of the classes in the following table.

|Class|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|`CAutomationEvents`|Implements an event root object, retrieved from the `DTE.Events` object.|
|`CProjectsEventsContainer` and `CProjectItemsEventsContainer`|Implement the event source objects that fire the corresponding events.|

 The following code example shows how to respond to a request for an event object.

```cpp
STDMETHODIMP CVsPackage::GetAutomationObject(
    /* [in]  */ LPCOLESTR       pszPropName,
    /* [out] */ IDispatch **    ppIDispatch)
{
    ExpectedPtrRet(ppIDispatch);
    *ppIDispatch = NULL;

    if (_wcsicmp(pszPropName, g_wszAutomationProjects) == 0)
        //Is the requested name our Projects object?
    {
        return GetAutomationProjects(ppIDispatch);
        // Gets our Projects object.
    }
    else if (_wcsicmp(pszPropName, g_wszAutomationProjectsEvents) == 0)
        //Is the requested name our ProjectsEvents object?
    {
        return CAutomationEvents::GetAutomationEvents(ppIDispatch);
          // Gets our ProjectEvents object.
    }
    else if (_wcsicmp(pszPropName, g_wszAutomationProjectItemsEvents) == 0)  //Is the requested name our ProjectsItemsEvents object?
    {
        return CAutomationEvents::GetAutomationEvents(ppIDispatch);
          // Gets our ProjectItemsEvents object.
    }
    return E_INVALIDARG;
}
```

 In the code above, `g_wszAutomationProjects` is the name of your project collection (*FigProjects*), `g_wszAutomationProjectsEvents` (*FigProjectsEvents*) and `g_wszAutomationProjectItemsEvents` (*FigProjectItemEvents*) are the names of project events and project items events that are sourced from your VSPackage implementation.

 Event objects are retrieved from the same central location, the `DTE.Events` object. This way, all event objects are grouped together so that an end user does not have to browse the entire object model to find a specific event. This also lets you provide your specific VSPackage objects, instead of requiring you to implement your own code for system-wide events. However, for the end user, who must find an event for your `ProjectItem` interface, it is not immediately clear from where that event object is retrieved.
