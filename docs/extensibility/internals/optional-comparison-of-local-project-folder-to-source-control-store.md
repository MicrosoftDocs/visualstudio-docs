# Optional Comparison of Local Project Folder to Source Control Store
In Source control Plug-in API 1.2 the comparison between the local project folder and source control is accomplished by using the functions [SccDirQueryInfo](../../extensibility/sccdirqueryinfo-function.md) and [SccDirDiff](../../extensibility/sccdirdiff-function.md).

 Within **Solution Explorer**, if a folder is selected instead of an individual file, the **Compare versions** shortcut menu invokes the new [SccDirQueryInfo](../../extensibility/sccdirqueryinfo-function.md) and [SccDirDiff](../../extensibility/sccdirdiff-function.md) in the source control plug-in.

## New Capability Flags
 `SCC_CAP_DIRECTORYDIFF`

 `SCC_CAP_DIRECTORYCHECKOUT`

## New Functions
- [SccDirDiff](../../extensibility/sccdirdiff-function.md)

- [SccDirQueryInfo](../../extensibility/sccdirqueryinfo-function.md)

 The `SccDirQueryInfo` function is called before `SccDirDiff` to determine if the working directory is source-controlled. The `SccDirDiff` function displays the differences between the current local directory and the corresponding source control folder. This command asks the source control plug-in to display the list of changes to the directory. A source control plug-in provides its own UI to display the differences.

> [!NOTE]
> This function uses the same command flags as [SccDiff](../../extensibility/sccdiff-function.md). As a source control plug-in provider, you may choose to not support the "quick diff" operation for directories.
