# Web Projects
A Web project system is a project system that creates Web projects. Web projects in turn create Web applications. You can program a Web page using traditional programming languages, such as [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)], to collect and process information from a user, store it in a database, and so on. Web pages with associated code are called smart Web pages.

## In This Section

- [Web Site Support](../../extensibility/internals/web-site-support.md)

 Presents an overview of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Web site projects. A Web site project generates one executable file for each smart Web page. Additional executable files are generated from the source code files in the /App_Code folder.
