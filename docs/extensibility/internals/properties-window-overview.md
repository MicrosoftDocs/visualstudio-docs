# Properties Window Overview
The **Properties** window is used to display properties for objects selected in the two main types of windows available in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). These two types of windows are:

- Tool windows such as Solution Explorer, Class View, and Object browser

- Document windows containing such editors and designers as the forms designer, XML editor, and HTML editor

## Using the Properties Window
 The **Properties** window displays the properties of single or multiple selected items. If multiple items are selected, the intersection of all properties for all selected objects is displayed.

 Events related to a selected object within a form design window or HTML editor using COM+ metadata are displayed in the **Properties** window. For example, you can select a button and display its associated events, such as an `OnClick` event, which can be linked to that button.

 Events displayed in the **Properties** window are primarily used with objects that are bound to code. If you are editing a file format that does not have anything to do with code, you are not going to have any events. Events are only displayed in the **Properties** window when there is a binding between running code and certain events associated with specific objects. An example of this would be code behind a selected object that executes when that object is activated.

 The following table lists the primary interfaces used by the **Properties** window.

|Interface Name|Description|
|--------------------|-----------------|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.ICategorizeProperties>|Provides a list of categories to the **Properties** window and maps each property to a category.|
|[IDispatch Interface](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch)|Exposes an object's methods and properties to programming tools and other applications that support automation.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IProvidePropertyBuilder>|Provides ellipsis (...) buttons called *builders* that open modal dialog windows implemented by the object itself. Used when a value is not easily typed by the user in a text field. For example, it might be used to open a color picker that determines the RGB value for you.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.ISelectionContainer>|Provides access to objects used to update information displayed in the **Properties** window. <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.ISelectionContainer> is implemented by VSPackages for each window that contains selectable objects with related properties to be displayed.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.ITypeInfo>|Provides information about the type of an object such as methods of an interface and fields of a structure.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsMonitorSelection>|Enables VSPackages to receive notification of selection events and to retrieve information about the current project hierarchy, item, element value, and command UI context.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsMultiItemSelect>|Provides the environment with access to multiple selections.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPerPropertyBrowsing>|Used to provide localized names on some properties displayed in the **Properties** window.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSelectionEvents>|Notifies registered VSPackages of changes to the current selection, element value, or command UI context.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsTrackSelectionEx>|Notifies the environment of a change in the current selection and provides access to hierarchy and item information relating to the new selection.|

 For further information on `IDispatch`, see the MSDN library.
