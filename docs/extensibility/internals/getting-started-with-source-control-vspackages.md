# Get started with source control VSPackages

A source-control VSPackage is a more advanced alternative to the source control plug-in. For more information about source control plug-ins, see [Create a source control plug-in](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-plug-in.md). A source-control VSPackage enables complete control over the source control model, features, and user interface (UI), and it integrates into the Visual Studio environment as a VSPackage.

## In this section

[Determine whether to implement a source control VSPackage](../../extensibility/internals/determining-whether-to-implement-a-source-control-vspackage.md)

Explains the choices for source control solutions and provides broad guidelines for choosing an appropriate integration path.
