# Create a source control VSPackage
This documentation includes links to the architecture overview of a source-control package integrated with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the API that is defined by the interfaces to be implemented and the services to be consumed, and a sample that illustrates a simple source control package implementation.

 With a source control VSPackage, you can create a deep integration path for source control to integrate with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. It enables the package to bypass the default source control UI hosted by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], respond to source control requests from the project system, and interact with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] components such as **Solution Explorer**. The [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../../extensibility/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] empowers [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] partners with a mechanism to create a VSPackage that can integrate with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] using a service model.

## In this section
- [Get started](../../extensibility/internals/getting-started-with-source-control-vspackages.md)

 Discusses the source control package, which is a more advanced alternative to the source control plug-in for implementing source control features in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

- [Architecture](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-vspackage-architecture.md)

 Presents a diagram and explains the components of a source control package.

- [Features](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-vspackage-features.md)

 Describes the various features of a source control package.

- [Design elements](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-vspackage-design-elements.md)

 Describes the structure of the VSPackage that a source control package must implement for deep integration.

## Related sections
- [Create a source control plug-in](../../extensibility/internals/creating-a-source-control-plug-in.md)

 Discusses how to create a source control plug-in that supplies source control functionality in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] source control user interface (UI).

- [Source control](../../extensibility/internals/source-control.md)

 Discusses the options for implementing source control as an integrated feature of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
