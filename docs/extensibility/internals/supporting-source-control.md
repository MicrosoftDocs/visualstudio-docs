# Supporting Source Control
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] supports file checkouts, check-ins, and other source control operations for your project or editor. As a source control client, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is designed to interact with a source control package, such as [!INCLUDE[vsvss](../../extensibility/includes/vsvss_md.md)], which provides archiving, versioning, and control facilities for a dynamically defined set of files.

## In This Section
- [Model for Source Control Packages](../../extensibility/internals/model-for-source-control-packages.md)

 Describes the interfaces a project type must implement to support source control.

- [Design Decisions](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-design-decisions.md)

 Provides questions whose answers change how you implement a project type.

- [Configuration Details](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-configuration-details.md)

 Describes how supporting source control changes the implementation of a project type.

- [Additional Guidelines for Projects and Editors](../../extensibility/internals/additional-source-control-guidelines-for-projects-and-editors.md)

 Discusses best practices for project types and editors.

- [Runtime Details](../../extensibility/internals/source-control-runtime-details.md)

 Describes how to register a project when a user adds it to a source-control system.
