# Test Guide for Source Control Plug-ins
This section provides guidance for testing your source control plug-in with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. An extensive overview of the most common testing areas, as well as some of the more intricate areas that may be problematic is provided. This overview is not meant to be an exhaustive list of test cases.

> [!NOTE]
> Some bug fixes and improvements to the latest [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE may uncover problems with existing source control plug-ins that were previously not encountered while using previous versions of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. It is strongly recommended that you test your existing source control plug-in for the areas enumerated in this section, even if no changes have been made to the plug-in since the previous version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

## Common Preparation
 A machine with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and the target source control plug-in installed, is required. A second machine similarly configured can be used for some of the Open from Source Control tests.

## Definition of Terms
 For the purpose of this test guide, use the following term definitions:

 Client project
 Any project type available in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] that supports source control integration (for example, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)]).

 Web project
 There are four types of Web projects: File System, Local IIS, Remote Sites, and FTP.

- File System projects are created on a local path, but they do not require the Internet Information Services (IIS) to be installed as they are accessed internally via a UNC path, and can be placed under source control from inside the IDE, much like client projects.

- Local IIS projects work with IIS that is installed on the same machine and are accessed with a URL pointing to the local machine.

- Remote Sites projects are also created under an IIS Services, but they are placed under source control on the IIS server machine and not from inside the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.

- FTP projects are accessed through a remote FTP server but they cannot be placed under source control.

  Enlistment
  Another term for the solution or project under source control.

  Version Store
  The source control database that is being accessed through the Source Control Plug-in API.
