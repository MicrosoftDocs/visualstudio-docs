# Legacy language service features 1
A managed package framework (MPF) language service can support one or more [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] features, such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and breakpoint validation. Each feature can be implemented independent of the others but all require a parser and a scanner except for syntax highlighting, which requires only a scanner.

## In This Section
- [Brace Matching in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/brace-matching-in-a-legacy-language-service.md)

 Describes what is required to support language pair matching, also known as brace matching.

- [Commenting Code in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/commenting-code-in-a-legacy-language-service.md)

 Describes what is required to support commenting and uncommenting of selected code.

- [Custom Document Properties in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/custom-document-properties-in-a-legacy-language-service.md)

- [Parameter Info in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/parameter-info-in-a-legacy-language-service2.md)

 Describes what is required to support the IntelliSense Parameter Info operation for displaying a method signature as the method is typed.

- [Quick Info in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/quick-info-in-a-legacy-language-service.md)

 Describes what is required to support the IntelliSense Quick Info operation for displaying information about an identifier.

- [Member Completion in a Legacy Language Service](../../extensibility/internals/member-completion-in-a-legacy-language-service.md)

 Describes what is required to support the IntelliSense Member Completion operation for selecting a member of a namespace from a list.
