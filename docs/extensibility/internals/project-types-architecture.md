# Project Types Architecture
This section contains detailed information about the architecture of project types in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

## In This Section
- [Elements of a Project Model](../../extensibility/internals/elements-of-a-project-model.md)

 Lists the services a project type can consume and the interfaces it must implement.

- [Project Model Core Components](../../extensibility/internals/project-model-core-components.md)

 Describes the interfaces project types both must implement and optionally can implement to provide additional functionality.

- [When to Create Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/when-to-create-project-types.md)

 Helps you decide when you must create a project type and when you can use another [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] extensibility feature such as VSPackages and editors to achieve the same goal.

- [Hierarchies and Selection](../../extensibility/internals/hierarchies-and-selection.md)

 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] uses hierarchies and selection context to provide a consistent and simplified user experience.

## Related Sections
- [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)

 Explains how project subtypes let you customize the behavior of the project systems of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)].

- [Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/project-types.md)

 Provides an overview of projects as the basic building blocks of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). Links are provided to additional topics that explain how projects control building and compiling code.
