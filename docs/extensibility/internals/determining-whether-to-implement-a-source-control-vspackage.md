# Determine whether to implement a source control VSPackage

This section elaborates the choices of source control plug-ins and source control VSPackages for extending source control solutions and gives broad guidelines about choosing a suitable integration path.

## Small source control solution with limited resources

 If you have limited resources and cannot be burdened with the overhead of writing a source control package, you can create Source Control Plug-in API-based plug-ins. Doing so allows you to work side by side with source control packages, and you can switch between source control plug-ins and packages on demand. For more information, see [Registration and selection](../../extensibility/internals/registration-and-selection-source-control-vspackage.md).

## Large source control solution with a rich feature set

 If you want to implement a source control solution that provides a rich source control model that is not adequately captured by using the Source Control Plug-in API, you may consider a source control package as the integration path. This applies especially if you would rather replace the Source Control Adapter Package (which communicates with source control plug-ins and provides a basic source control UI) with your own so that you can handle the source control events in a custom manner. If you already have a satisfactory source control UI and want to preserve that experience in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the source control package option lets you do just that. The source control package is not generic and is designed solely for use with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.

 If you want to implement a source control solution that provides flexibility and richer control over the source control logic and UI, you may prefer the source control package integration route. You can:

1. Register your own source control VSPackage (see [Registration and selection](../../extensibility/internals/registration-and-selection-source-control-vspackage.md)).

2. Replace the default source control UI with your custom UI (see [Custom user interface](../../extensibility/internals/custom-user-interface-source-control-vspackage.md)).

3. Specify glyphs to be used and handle Solution Explorer glyph events (see [Glyph control](../../extensibility/internals/glyph-control-source-control-vspackage.md)).

4. Handle Query Edit and Query Save events (see [Query Edit Query Save](../../extensibility/internals/query-edit-query-save-source-control-vspackage.md)).
