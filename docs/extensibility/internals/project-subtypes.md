# Project Subtypes
Project subtypes let you customize or flavor the behavior of the project systems of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Customizations include saving additional data in the project file, adding or filtering items in the **Add New Item** dialog box, controlling how assemblies are debugged and deployed, and extending the project **Property Pages** dialog box. VSPackages implement project subtypes using COM aggregation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Visual C++ project system does not support project subtypes. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] itself uses project subtypes to implement SQL Server and Smart Device projects.

## In This Section

- [Project Subtypes Design](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes-design.md)

  Describes the concept of project subtypes.

- [Initialization Sequence of Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/initialization-sequence-of-project-subtypes.md)

  Describes the programmatic project subtype initialization sequence by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] environment.

- [Properties and Methods Extended by Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/properties-and-methods-extended-by-project-subtypes.md)

  Provides detailed descriptions of the features and methods most frequently extended by using project subtypes.

- [Persisting Data in the MSBuild Project File](../../extensibility/internals/persisting-data-in-the-msbuild-project-file.md)

  Describes how to persist data in a project file and how to use <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IPersistXMLFragment> to maintain the data in the project file across the project subtype aggregation levels.

- [Project Property User Interface](../../extensibility/internals/project-property-user-interface.md)

  Describes how project subtypes can modify the project **Property Pages** dialog box.

- [Extending the Object Model of the Base Project](../../extensibility/internals/extending-the-object-model-of-the-base-project.md)

  Provides information about how project subtypes can use Automation Extenders to extend the automation object model.

- [Contributing to the Add New Item Dialog Box](../../extensibility/internals/contributing-to-the-add-new-item-dialog-box.md)

  Describes how to add items to the **Add New Item** dialog box.

- [Saving Data in Project Files](../../extensibility/saving-data-in-project-files.md)

  Explains how a project subtype can save and retrieve subtype-specific data in the project file by using the Managed Package Framework (MPF).

- [Handling Specialized Deployment](../../extensibility/internals/handling-specialized-deployment.md)

  Explains how project subtypes can supply specialized deployment behavior by implementing the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsDeployableProjectCfg> interface.

- [Adding and Removing Property Pages](../../extensibility/adding-and-removing-property-pages.md)

  Describes adding and removing property pages in Project Designer.
