# How to: Use built-in colorable items
Before you use the built-in colorable items, you must first signal to the integrated development environment (IDE) that you are not providing your own custom colorable items, which in this case would be <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsProvideColorableItems> objects. You do this by setting a registry entry for the language service.

## To use built-in colorable items

1. Under **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\VisualStudio\\<X.Y>\Languages\Language Services\\<Language Name\>**, where \<X.Y> is a version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and \<Language Name> is the name of your language, create a DWORD registry entry value called **RequestStockColors**.

2. Set the **RequestStockColors** registry entry value to *1*.

    After you create the registry entry, your colorizer's <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsColorizer.ColorizeLine%2A> method can use the members of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.DEFAULTITEMS> enumeration to fill in the array of color attributes for use by the editor.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not set this registry entry if you are providing custom colorable items. For more information, see [Custom colorable items](../../extensibility/internals/custom-colorable-items.md).
