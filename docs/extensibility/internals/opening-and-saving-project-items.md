# Opening and Saving Project Items
When you add a new project type, you must manage the opening and saving of your projects files in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). The following topics discuss the different approaches to opening and saving files.

## In This Section
- [Displaying Files By Using the Open File Command](../../extensibility/internals/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-file-command.md)

 Provides a step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open File** command and the role of projects in responding to this command.

- [Displaying Files By Using the Open With Command](../../extensibility/internals/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-with-command.md)

 Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open With** command, prompting the opening of a file that has some choice of standard editors.

- [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../../extensibility/how-to-open-project-specific-editors.md)

 Provides step-by-step instructions for specifying that files of a particular type in your project should be opened by using a project-specific editor.

- [Saving a Custom Document](../../extensibility/internals/saving-a-custom-document.md)

 Provides a diagram and detailed explanation of how the IDE handles the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Save All** commands for documents opened in a custom editor.

- [Determining Which Editor Opens a File in a Project](../../extensibility/internals/determining-which-editor-opens-a-file-in-a-project.md)

 Discusses the process that the IDE follows to select the appropriate editor or designer for a file.

## Related Sections
- [Creating Custom Editors and Designers](../../extensibility/creating-custom-editors-and-designers.md)

 Lists the four types of editors that the IDE can host and gives descriptions of each editor.

- [Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/project-types.md)

 Discusses how projects control the way that code is compiled and built, how editors are opened, and how project items are formatted.
