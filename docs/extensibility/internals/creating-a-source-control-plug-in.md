# Create a source control plug-in
The Visual Studio SDK provides resources that enable you to add source control capability to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). It lets you use any plug-in DLL that complies with the Source Control Plug-in API outlined in this documentation.
