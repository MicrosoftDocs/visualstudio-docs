# Add project and project item templates
When you create your own project types, you must provide support for adding new projects and project items by using the standard [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) dialog boxes. The following topics discuss different techniques for adding projects and project items.

## In this section
- [Project context](../../extensibility/internals/project-context.md)

 Explains that the project provides most of the context information for what transpires in the environment.

- [Project priority](../../extensibility/internals/project-priority.md)

 Explains that a project item is usually a member of one project to help avoid ambiguity about which project is used to open the item.

- [Miscellaneous Files project](../../extensibility/internals/miscellaneous-files-project.md)

 Provides information about the two types of editors that can be used to open files in a project and the role the project plays in determining which editor to use when a project item is opened.

- [Register project and item templates](../../extensibility/internals/registering-project-and-item-templates.md)

 Explains what occurs when a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project is created.

- [Add items to the Add New Item dialog box](../../extensibility/internals/adding-items-to-the-add-new-item-dialog-boxes.md)

 Explains the process for adding items to the **Add New Item** dialog box.

- [Add directories to the New Project dialog Box](../../extensibility/internals/adding-directories-to-the-new-project-dialog-box.md)

 Provides an example of registering a new directory that contains custom templates made available by a VSPackage.

- [Add directories to the Add New Item dialog box](../../extensibility/internals/adding-directories-to-the-add-new-item-dialog-box.md)

 Provides an example of registering a new set of directories for the **Add New Item** dialog box.

- [IDE-defined commands for extending project systems](../../extensibility/internals/ide-defined-commands-for-extending-project-systems.md)

 Lists different types of command items used for extending project systems.

- [CATIDs for objects that are typically used to extend projects](../../extensibility/internals/catids-for-objects-that-are-typically-used-to-extend-projects.md)

 Lists CATIDs for objects that are used to extend [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../code-quality/includes/vcprvc_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project systems.

## Related sections
- [How to: Open project-specific editors](../../extensibility/how-to-open-project-specific-editors.md)

 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening an item intrinsically bound to a specific editor for a project.

- [How to: Open standard editors](../../extensibility/how-to-open-standard-editors.md)

 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening a standard editor.

- [Project subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)

 Provides links to project subtype conceptual topics. Project subtypes extend existing [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects.

- [Project types](../../extensibility/internals/project-types.md)

 Provides links to additional topics that offer information about how to design new project types.
