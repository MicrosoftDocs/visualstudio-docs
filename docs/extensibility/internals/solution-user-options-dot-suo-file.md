# Solution User Options (.Suo) File
The solution user options (.suo) file contains per-user solution options. This file should not be checked in to source code control.

 The solution user options (.suo) file is a structured storage, or compound, file stored in a binary format. You save user information into streams with the name of the stream being the key that will be used to identify the information in the .suo file. The solution user options file is used to store user preference settings, and is created automatically when Visual Studio saves a solution.

 When the environment opens a .suo file, it enumerates all currently loaded VSPackages. If a VSPackage implements the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPersistSolutionOpts> interface, then the environment calls the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPersistSolutionOpts.LoadUserOptions%2A> method on the VSPackage asking it to load all of its data from the .suo file.

 It is the VSPackage's responsibility to know what streams it might have written into the .suo file. For each stream that it wrote, the VSPackage calls back to the environment through <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSolutionPersistence.LoadPackageUserOpts%2A> to load a particular stream that is identified by the key, which is the name of the stream. The environment then calls back to the VSPackage to read that particular stream passing the name of the stream and an `IStream` pointer to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSolutionPersistence.LoadPackageUserOpts%2A> method.

 At that point, another call is made to `LoadUserOptions` to see if there is another section of the .suo file that has to be read. This process continues until all of the data streams in the .suo file have been read and processed by the environment.

 When the solution is saved or closed, the environment calls the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSolutionPersistence.SavePackageSolutionProps%2A> method with a pointer to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPersistSolutionOpts.SaveUserOptions%2A> method. An `IStream` containing the binary information to be saved is passed to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPersistSolutionOpts.WriteUserOptions%2A> method, which then writes the information to the .suo file and calls the `SaveUserOptions` method again to see if there is another stream of information to write to the .suo file.

 These two methods, `SaveUserOptions` and `WriteUserOptions`, are called recursively for each stream of information to be saved to the .suo file, passing in the pointer to `IVsSolutionPersistence`. They are called recursively to allow for the writing of multiple streams to the .suo file. In that way, user information is persisted with the solution and is guaranteed to be there the next time the solution is opened.
