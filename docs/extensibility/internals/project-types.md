# Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] includes several project types for languages such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] also lets you create your own project types.

## In This Section
- [Essentials](../../extensibility/internals/project-type-essentials.md)

 Provides information about how to add support for source-control systems to your project types.

- [Nesting Projects](../../extensibility/internals/nesting-projects.md)

- [Upgrading Projects](../../extensibility/internals/upgrading-projects.md)

 Describes how your project type can participate in the Upgrade Wizard to upgrade project files from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

- [Architecture](../../extensibility/internals/project-types-architecture.md)

 Provides detailed technical information about project types.

- [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)

 Provides links to project subtype topics. Project subtypes enable extension of most kinds of project types, including your own.

- [Projects](../../extensibility/internals/projects.md)

 Describes how to extend the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project system.
