# Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] includes several project types for languages such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../data-tools/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] also lets you create your own project types.

## In This Section
- [Essentials](../../extensibility/internals/project-type-essentials.md)

 Presents the important information that you must have to start working with project types.

- [Adding a Command to the Solution Explorer Toolbar](../../extensibility/adding-a-command-to-the-solution-explorer-toolbar.md)

 Details the steps that you must follow to add a button to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Solution Explorer** toolbar.

- [Adding Project and Project Item Templates](../../extensibility/internals/adding-project-and-project-item-templates.md)

 Discusses how you can add templates to your project types so that users can create new projects and project items according to a pattern.

- [Opening and Saving Project Items](../../extensibility/internals/opening-and-saving-project-items.md)

 Provides information about how to manage the items your project type supports.

- [Managing Configuration Options](../../extensibility/internals/managing-configuration-options.md)

- [Supporting Source Control](../../extensibility/internals/supporting-source-control.md)

 Provides information about how to add support for source-control systems to your project types.

- [Nesting Projects](../../extensibility/internals/nesting-projects.md)

 Explains how your project types can support *nesting*, so that projects can be grouped together in **Solution Explorer**.

- [Upgrading Projects](../../extensibility/internals/upgrading-projects.md)

 Describes how your project type can participate in the Upgrade Wizard to upgrade project files from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

- [Architecture](../../extensibility/internals/project-types-architecture.md)

 Provides detailed technical information about project types.

## Related Sections

 Provides an overview of how the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) displays a project as a hierarchy.

- [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)

 Provides links to project subtype topics. Project subtypes enable extension of most kinds of project types, including your own.

- [Projects](../../extensibility/internals/projects.md)

 Describes how to extend the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project system.
