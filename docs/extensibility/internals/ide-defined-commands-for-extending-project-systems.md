# IDE-Defined Commands for Extending Project Systems
When you want to extend project systems, you can use commands and command groups provided by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.

 The following sections list command items that are especially useful for extending project systems.

## Command Menus
 The following table shows the command menus that are useful locations for you to put high-level commands that invoke a project extender.

|Command menu|Description|
|------------------|-----------------|
|IDM_VS_MENU_PROJECT|The **Project** top-level menu.|
|IDM_VS_TOOL_PROJWIN|The **Solution Explorer** toolbar.|

## Shortcut Menus
 The following table shows the shortcut menus that apply when a single node is selected in the **Solution Explorer**, or when there are multiple homogenous selections in the **Solution Explorer**, which is when all selected nodes are of the same type.

|Shortcut menu|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_PROJNODE>|Applies when the project node is selected.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_ITEMNODE>|Applies when a file is selected.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_FOLDERNODE>|Applies when a folder is selected.|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_WEBREFFOLDER|Applies when the Web Reference folder is selected.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_REFERENCEROOT>|Applies when the references root node called "References" is selected.|
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_REFERENCE>|Applies when reference nodes are selected; these include assembly, COM, and project references only. Does not include Web references.|

 The following table shows the shortcut menus that apply when the selection in the **Solution Explorer** spans multiple hierarchies,

|Shortcut menu|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_XPROJ_SLNPROJ|Applies when the current selection contains the solution node and root project nodes.|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_XPROJ_SLNITEM|Applies when the current selection contains the solution node and project items.|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_XPROJ_MULTIPROJ|Applies when the current selection consists of multiple root project nodes only.|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_XPROJ_PROJITEM|Applies when the current selection contains a mix of root project nodes and project items. Additionally, the selection may contain the solution node.|
|IDM_VS_CTXT_XPROJ_MULTIITEM|Applies when the current selection contains project items from multiple projects in the solution, or when items of different types are selected in the same project.|

## Command Groups
 The following table shows the command groups that you can use when you extend projects, and that you can access through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsMenus.IDM_VS_CTXT_PROJNODE> shortcut menu.

|Command group|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_BUILD|Commands for building, rebuilding, and deploying the project.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_COMPILELINK|Commands for compiling and linking the project.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_CONFIG|Commands that set project configuration and build order.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_ADD|Commands that add items to the project.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_START|Commands that set the startup project associated with the F5 key.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_SAVE|Commands for saving project items.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_DEBUG|Commands for debugging.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_SCC|Commands for source control.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_TRANSFER|Commands for cut, copy and paste operations.|
|IDG_VS_CTXT_PROJECT_PROPERTIES|Commands that provide access to the **Project Properties** dialog box.|
