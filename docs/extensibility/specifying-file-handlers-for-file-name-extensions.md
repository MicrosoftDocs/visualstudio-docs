# Specifying File Handlers for File Name Extensions
There are a number of ways to determine the application that handles a file which has a particular file extension. The OpenWithList and OpenWithProgids verbs are two ways to specify file handlers under the registry entry for the file extension.

## OpenWithList Verb
 When you right-click a file in Windows Explorer, you see the **Open** command. If more than one product is associated with an extension, you see an **Open With** submenu.

 You can register different applications to open an extension by setting the OpenWithList key for the file extension in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. The applications listed under this key for a file extension appear under the **Recommended Programs** heading in the **Open With** dialog box. The following example shows the applications registered to open the .vcproj file extension.

```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\
   .vcproj\
      (default)="VisualStudio.vcproj.14.0"
      OpenWithList\
         devenv.exe
```

> [!NOTE]
> The keys specifying applications are from the list under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications.

 By adding an OpenWithList key, you declare that your application supports a file extension even if another application takes ownership of the extension. This could be a future version of your application or another application.

## OpenWithProgIDs
 Programmatic identifiers (ProgIDs) are friendly versions of ClassIDs that identify a version of an application or COM object. Every co-creatable object should have its own ProgID. For example, VisualStudio.DTE.7.1 starts Visual Studio .NET 2003 while VisualStudio.DTE.10.0 starts [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. As the owner of a project type or project item type, you must create a version-specific ProgID for your file extension. These ProgIDs may be redundant in that more than one ProgID may start the same application. For more information, see [Registering Verbs for File Name Extensions](../extensibility/registering-verbs-for-file-name-extensions.md).

 Use the following naming convention for versioned file ProgIDs to avoid duplication with registration from other vendors:

|File extension|Versioned ProgID|
|--------------------|----------------------|
|.extension|ProductName. extension.versionMajor.versionMinor|

 You can register different applications that are able to open a particular file extension by adding versioned ProgIDs as values to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\<extension>*\OpenWithProgids key. This registry key contains a list of alternate ProgIDs associated with the file extension. The applications associated with the listed ProgIDs appear in the **Open With**_Product Name_ submenu. If the same application is specified in both the `OpenWithList` and `OpenWithProgids` keys, the operating system merges the duplicates.

> [!NOTE]
> The `OpenWithProgids` key is only supported in Windows XP. Because other operating systems ignore this key, do not use it as the only registration for file handlers. Use this key to provide a better user experience in Windows XP.

 Add the desired ProgIDs as values of the type REG_NONE. The following code provides an example of registering ProgIDs for a file extension (.*ext*).

```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\
   .ext\
      (default)="MyProduct.ext.14.0"
      OpenWithProgids
         progid        REG_NONE (zero-length binary value)
         otherprogid   REG_NONE (zero-length binary value)
```

 The ProgID specified as the default value for the file extension is the default file handler. If you modify the ProgID for a file extension that shipped with a previous version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] or that can be taken over by other applications, then you must register the `OpenWithProgids` key for your file extension and specify the new ProgID in the list along with the old ProgIDs you support. For example:

```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\
   .vcproj\
      (default)="VisualStudio.vcproj.14.0"
      OpenWithProgids
         vcprojfile              //old progid
         VisualStudio.vcproj.12.0 //old progid
         VisualStudio.vcproj.14.0 //new progid
```

 If the old ProgID has verbs associated with it, then these verbs will also appear under **Open With** *Product Name* in the shortcut menu.
