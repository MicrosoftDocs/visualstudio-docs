# Editor and language service extensions
You can extend most features of the Visual Studio code editor. The editor is based on the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and is written in managed code. Although this design differs from the designs in earlier versions of Visual Studio, it provides most of the same features. To extend the editor, use the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF).

 The Visual Studio SDK provides adapters known as *shims* to support VSPackages that were written for earlier versions. Nevertheless, if you have an existing VSPackage, we recommend that you update it to the new technology to obtain better performance and reliability.
