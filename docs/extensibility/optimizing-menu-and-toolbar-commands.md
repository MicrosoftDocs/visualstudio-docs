# Optimizing Menu and Toolbar Commands
The addition of VSPackages and their corresponding commands to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] may cause a crowded UI. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides ways to help minimize UI command confusion.

 [Making Commands Available](../extensibility/making-commands-available.md)  
 Provides general guidelines for minimizing crowding of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] UI when you add VSPackages.  
  
 [Placement Guidelines](../extensibility/command-placement-guidelines.md)  
 Provides specific guidelines for implementing a VSPackage according to the size of the command set.
