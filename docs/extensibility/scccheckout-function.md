# SccCheckout function
Given a list of fully qualified file names, this function checks them out to the local drive. The comment applies to all files being checked out. The comment argument can be a `null` string.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccCheckout (
   LPVOID    pvContext,
   HWND      hWnd,
   LONG      nFiles,
   LPCSTR*   lpFileNames,
   LPCSTR    lpComment,
   LONG      fOptions,
   LPCMDOPTS pvOptions
);
```

### Parameters
 pvContext

[in] The source control plug-in context structure.

 hWnd

[in] A handle to the IDE window that the source control plug-in can use as a parent for any dialog boxes that it provides.

 nFiles

[in] Number of files selected to be checked out.

 lpFileNames

[in] Array of fully qualified local path names of files to be checked out.

 lpComment

[in] Comment to be applied to each of the selected files being checked out.

 fOptions

[in] Command flags (see [Bitflags used by specific commands](../extensibility/bitflags-used-by-specific-commands.md)).

 pvOptions

[in] Source control plug-in-specific options.

## Return value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|Check out was successful.|
|SCC_E_FILENOTCONTROLLED|The selected file is not under source code control.|
|SCC_E_ACCESSFAILURE|There was a problem accessing the source control system, probably due to network or contention issues. A retry is recommended.|
|SCC_E_NOTAUTHORIZED|The user is not allowed to perform this operation.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECIFICERROR|Nonspecific failure. The file was not checked out.|
|SCC_E_ALREADYCHECKEDOUT|The user already has the file checked out.|
