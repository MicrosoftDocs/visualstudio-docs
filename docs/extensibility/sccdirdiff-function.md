# SccDirDiff function
This function displays the differences between the current local directory on the client disk and the corresponding project under source control.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccDirDiff(
   LPVOID    pContext,
   HWND      hWnd,
   LPCSTR    lpDirName,
   LONG      dwFlags,
   LPCMDOPTS pvOptions
);
```

### Parameters
 pContext

[in] The source control plug-in context structure.

 hWnd

[in] A handle to the IDE window that the source control plug-in can use as a parent for any dialog boxes that it provides.

 lpDirName

[in] Fully qualified path to the local directory for which to show a visual difference.

 dwFlags

[in] Command flags (see Remarks section).

 pvOptions

[in] Source control plug-in-specific options.

## Return value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|The directory on disk is the same as the project in source code control.|
|SCC_I_FILESDIFFER|The directory on disk is different from the project in source code control.|
|SCC_I_RELOADFILE|A file or project needs to be reloaded.|
|SCC_E_FILENOTCONTROLLED|The directory is not under source code control.|
|SCC_E_NOTAUTHORIZED|The user is not allowed to perform this operation.|
|SCC_E_ACCESSFAILURE|There was a problem accessing the source control system, probably due to network or contention issues. A retry is recommended.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECIFICERROR<br /><br /> SCC_E_UNKNOWNERROR|Nonspecific failure.|
|SCC_E_FILENOTEXIST|Local directory could not be found.|

## Remarks
 This function is used to instruct the source control plug-in to display to the user a list of changes to a specified directory. The plug-in opens its own window, in a format of its choice, to display the differences between the user's directory on disk and the corresponding project under version control.

 If a plug-in supports comparison of directories at all, it must support comparison of directories on a file-name basis even if the "quick-diff" options are not supported.

|`dwFlags`|Interpretation|
|---------------|--------------------|
|SCC_DIFF_IGNORECASE|Case-insensitive comparison (may be used for either quick diff or visual).|
|SCC_DIFF_IGNORESPACE|Ignores white space (may be used for either quick-diff or visual).|
|SCC_DIFF_QD_CONTENTS|If supported by the source control plug-in, silently compares the directory, byte by byte.|
|SCC_DIFF_QD_CHECKSUM|If supported by plug-in, silently compares the directory via a checksum, or, if not supported, falls back to SCC_DIFF_QD_CONTENTS.|
|SCC_DIFF_QD_TIME|If supported by plug-in, silently compares the directory via its timestamp, or, if not supported, falls back on SCC_DIFF_QD_CHECKSUM or SCC_DIFF_QD_CONTENTS.|

> [!NOTE]
> This function uses the same command flags as the [SccDiff](../extensibility/sccdiff-function.md). However, a source control plug-in may choose to not support the "quick-diff" operation for directories.
