# Reference (Visual Studio Debugging APIs)
The Visual Studio Debugging SDK references outline the basic model for the run-time architecture and functionality of the debugger and its components. The documentation makes as few assumptions as possible about the components and interfaces it describes, apart from the behavior it defines through the interfaces.  
  
 The goal of the reference section is to provide support to as diverse a set of languages, run times, and operating systems as possible.  
  
## In This Section  
 [API Reference](../extensibility/api-reference--visual-studio-debugging-.md)  
 Contains documentation for the interfaces, enumerators, and structures of the Visual Studio Debugging API.  
  
 [Glossary](../extensibility/visual-studio-debugger-glossary.md)  
 Provides a list of debugging-related terms and their definitions.
