# SccHistory Function
This function displays the history of the specified files.

## Syntax

```cpp
SCCRTN SccHistory(
   LPVOID    pvContext,
   HWND      hWnd,
   LONG      nFiles,
   LPCSTR*   lpFileNames,
   LONG      fOptions,
   LPCMDOPTS pvOptions
);
```

#### Parameters
 `pvContext`

[in] The source control plug-in context structure.

 `hWnd`

[in] A handle to the IDE window that the source control plug-in can use as a parent for any dialog boxes that it provides.

 `nFiles`

[in] Number of files specified in the `lpFileName` array.

 `lpFileName`

[in] Array of fully qualified names of files.

 `fOptions`

[in] Command flags (currently not used).

 `pvOptions`

[in] Source control plug-in-specific options.

## Return Value
 The source control plug-in implementation of this function is expected to return one of the following values:

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|SCC_OK|Version history was successfully obtained.|
|SCC_I_RELOADFILE|The source control system actually modified the file on disk while fetching the history (for instance, by getting an old version of it), so the IDE should reload this file.|
|SCC_E_FILENOTCONTROLLED|The file is not under source control.|
|SCC_E_OPNOTSUPPORTED|The source control system does not support this operation.|
|SCC_E_NOTAUTHORIZED|The user is not allowed to perform this operation.|
|SCC_E_ACCESSFAILURE|There was a problem accessing the source control system, probably due to network or contention issues. A retry is recommended.|
|SCC_E_PROJNOTOPEN|The project is has not been opened.|
|SCC_E_NONSPECIFICERROR|Nonspecific failure. File history could not be obtained.|

## Remarks
 The source control plug-in can display its own dialog box to show the history of each file, using `hWnd` as the parent window. Alternatively, the optional text output callback function supplied to the [SccOpenProject](../extensibility/sccopenproject-function.md) can be used, if it is supported.

 Note that under certain circumstances, the file being examined may change during the execution of this call. For example, the [!INCLUDE[vsvss](../extensibility/includes/vsvss_md.md)] history command gives the user a chance to get an old version of the file. In such a case, the source control plug-in returns `SCC_I_RELOAD` to warn the IDE that it needs to reload the file.

> [!NOTE]
> If the source control plug-in does not support this function for an array of files, only the file history for the first file can be displayed.
