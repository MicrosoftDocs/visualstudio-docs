# Prepare extensions for Windows Installer deployment
You cannot use a Windows Installer package (MSI) to deploy a VSIX package. However, you can extract the contents of a VSIX package for MSI deployment. This document shows how to prepare a project whose default output is a VSIX package for inclusion in a Setup project.

## Prepare an extension project for Windows Installer deployment
 Perform these steps on new extension projects before adding to a Setup project.

### To prepare an extension project for Windows Installer deployment

1. Create a VSPackage, MEF component, Editor Adornment, or other extensibility project type that includes a VSIX manifest.

2. Open the VSIX manifest in the code editor.

3. Set the `InstalledByMsi` element of the VSIX manifest to `true`. For more information about the VSIX manifest, see [VSIX extension schema 2.0 reference](../extensibility/vsix-extension-schema-2-0-reference.md).

     This prevents the VSIX installer from attempting to install the component.

4. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and click **Properties**.

5. Select the **VSIX** tab.

6. Check the box labeled **Copy VSIX content to the following location** and type the path to where the Setup project will pick up the files.

## Extract files from an existing VSIX package
 Perform these steps to add the content of an existing VSIX package to a Setup project when you do not have the source files.

### To extract files from an existing VSIX package

1. Rename the *.VSIX* file containing the extension from *filename.vsix* to *filename.zip*.

2. Copy the contents of the *.zip* file into a directory.

3. Delete the *[Content_types].xml* file from the directory.

4. Edit the VSIX manifest, as shown in the previous procedure.

5. Add the remaining files to your Setup project.
