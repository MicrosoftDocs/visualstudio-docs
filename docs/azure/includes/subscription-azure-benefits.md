Many Visual Studio subscriptions include [Azure individual Dev/Test credits](/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-azure-eligibility). If you're a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use these credits to try various Azure services at no cost. If you're not a subscriber and don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
