> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Azure [Azure Cloud Services (extended support)](../cloud-services-extended-support.md). Cloud Services (classic) is retired as of August 31, 2024. For more information, see [Cloud services (classic) deployment model is retiring on August 31, 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/cloud-services-retirement-announcement). For new development, we recommend that you use a newer service type designed for your specific purpose, such as [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview), [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp), or [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/overview). For the latest list of available services, see [Directory of Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/).

> Azure Cloud Services relies on connection strings for authentication in some cases, such as for storage accounts. Connection strings and passwords are inherently insecure due to the risk of unintended exposure or compromise. Microsoft recommends using managed identities for authentication, and services such as [Service Fabric managed clusters](/azure/service-fabric/overview-managed-cluster).
