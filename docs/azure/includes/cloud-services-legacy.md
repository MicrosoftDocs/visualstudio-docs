> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Azure [Azure Cloud Services (extended support)](../cloud-services-extended-support.md). On March 31, 2027, the Cloud Services (Extended Support) deployment model will be retired. As a result, the supporting Cloud Services tooling will not be available in the latest Visual Studio after this date. Cloud Services (Extended Support) tooling will continue to work in Visual Studio 2022 with general maintenance occurring until March 31, 2027. We recommend starting your migration planning now to ensure a smooth transition. See the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=486344) for more information, including detailed guidance on migrating your apps to modern Azure services.

> Azure Cloud Services relies on connection strings for authentication in some cases, such as for storage accounts. Connection strings and passwords are inherently insecure due to the risk of unintended exposure or compromise. Microsoft recommends using managed identities for authentication, and services such as [Service Fabric managed clusters](/azure/service-fabric/overview-managed-cluster).
