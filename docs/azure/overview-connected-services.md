# Overview: Connected Services

Connected Services is a collection of tools in Visual Studio that help you connect your application to the following:

* Azure services
* OpenAPI endpoints
* gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints
* Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) endpoints

Get started by right-clicking on the **Connected Services** node in Solution Explorer and select **Manage Connected Services**.

Supported project types vary by the type of service. You'll see the options that apply to your project type in the listed selections.

## Connect your app to gRPC, OpenAPI and WCF endpoints

Use Connected Services to connect your application to any of the following services:

| Name | ASP.NET Link | Description |
|-|-|-|
| [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) endpoints | [Develop ASP.NET Core apps with OpenAPI](/aspnet/core/web-api/Microsoft.dotnet-openapi) | A standard format for describing the capabilities of a service in computer-readable and human-readable form. |
| [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) endpoints | [Introduction to gRPC services on .NET](/aspnet/core/grpc/) | An open-source real-time procedure calling service. |
| [WCF](/dotnet/framework/wcf/) endpoints | n/a | A .NET Framework solution supporting programming with a distributed network of services. |

Visual Studio will generate any necessary client or server code to facilitate the communication.

## Connect your app Azure services

Use Connected Services to connect your application to live Azure services emulators and other local alternatives to Azure services. Visual Studio currently supports the following:

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| [Azure Storage](/azure/storage) | Scalable cloud storage with support for blobs, tables, queues, disks. |
| [Azure SignalR Service](/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview) | Real-time web functionality over HTTP. |
| [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) | Secure cloud storage for cryptographic keys and other secrets used by your Azure applications. |
| [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql) | Cloud-hosted SQL database. |
| [Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview)| In-memory data store based on the Redis software. |
| [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) | A fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development.| 
| [Azure Microsoft Identity Platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) | Authentication with Microsoft identities and social accounts. |

> [!NOTE]
> Using Publish you can deploy your application to Azure hosting services like Azure VMs, Azure App Service, Azure Functions and Azure Container Registry

## Support for Azure emulators and local alternatives

Visual Studio makes it easier to develop Azure applications locally by easing the transition from locally emulated services to services running in the cloud. You can use Connected Services to connect your application to local emulators and other local alternatives to Azure services. Visual Studio currently supports the following:

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| [Azure Storage Emulator](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=visual-studio) | Azurite is an Azure Storage emulator that runs on your local machine. |
| [Application Insights SDK](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) | Local mode for the Application Insights service.  |
| [SQL Server Express LocalDB](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb) | Local alternative to Azure SQL Database |
| [Secrets.json](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?tabs=windows) | Local alternative for Key Vault |

## Containers

Connected Services can help you run application dependencies that are emulating Azure services locally in a container. You can run the Azure Storage Emulator called Azurite in a container locally. You can also run Redis in a container locally to emulate Azure Cache for Redis.

## How it works

Visual Studio creates two new files visible in Solution Explorer under Properties called *serviceDependencies.json* and *serviceDependencies.local.json*. Both of these files are safe to check in as they do not contain any secrets.

Visual Studio also creates a file called *serviceDependencies.local.json.user* which is not visible in Solution Explorer by default. This file contains information that could be considered a secret (for example, resource IDs in Azure) and we do not recommend you check it in.
