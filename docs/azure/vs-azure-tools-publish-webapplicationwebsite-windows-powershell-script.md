The JSON configuration file specifies the details of what is to be deployed. It includes the information that you specified when you created the project, such as the name and username for the website. It also includes the database to provision, if any. The following code shows an example JSON configuration file:

```json
{
    "environmentSettings": {
        "webSite": {
            "name": "WebApplication10554",
            "location": "West US"
        },
        "databases": [
            {
                "connectionStringName": "DefaultConnection",
                "databaseName": "WebApplication10554_db",
                "serverName": "iss00brc88",
                "user": "sqluser2",
                "password": "",
                "edition": "",
                "size": "",
                "collation": "",
                "location": "West US"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can edit the JSON configuration file to change what is deployed. A webSite section is required, but the database section is optional.
