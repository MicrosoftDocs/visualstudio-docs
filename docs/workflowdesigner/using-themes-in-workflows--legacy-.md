# Using Themes in Workflows (Legacy)
This topic describes how to use themes in [!INCLUDE[wf](../workflowdesigner/includes/wf_md.md)] when using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../workflowdesigner/includes/wfd1_md.md)] that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../workflowdesigner/includes/netfx35_long_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../workflowdesigner/includes/vstecwinfx_md.md)].  
  
 You can customize the look of your workflows with the legacy designer by using [!INCLUDE[wf2](../workflowdesigner/includes/wf2_md.md)] themes. A theme defines the background and foreground colors, styles, icons, and other visual elements of a workflow. You can save themes for reuse by other workflows.  
  
 You create and edit themes by using the [Theme Configuration Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflowdesigner/theme-configuration-dialog-box--legacy-.md). To open this dialog box, select **Create New Theme** on the **Workflow** menu, or right-click the workflow design surface and select **Create New Theme**.  
  
 You can select default and saved custom themes by using the [Themes, Workflow Designer, Options Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflowdesigner/themes--workflow-designer--options-dialog-box--legacy-.md). To open this dialog box, click **Select Custom Theme** on the **Workflow** menu (or right-click the workflow design surface and click **Select Custom Theme**) and then select the **Workflow Designer** option. Select the theme you want and click **OK**.
