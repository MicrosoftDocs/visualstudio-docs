 The following table describes the options that are available for a schema set node.  
  
|Option|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Show Most Likely Root Elements**|Finds and highlights all global elements that are not referenced from global elements other than themselves.|  
|**Show Global Types**|Finds and highlights all global types in the schema set.|  
|**Show Global Elements**|Finds and highlights all global elements in the schema set.|  
|**Properties Window**|Opens the **Properties** window (if it is not already open). This window displays information about the node.|  
  
## Node Type: Namespace  
 The following table describes the options that are available for a namespace node.  
  
|Option|Description|

|**Show Global Types**|Finds and highlights all global types in the selected namespace.|  
|**Show Global Elements**|Finds and highlights all global elements in the selected namespace.|  
|**Properties Window**|Opens the **Properties** window (if it is not already open). This window displays information about the node.|

|**Show Global Types**|Finds and highlights all global types in this file.|  
|**Show Global Elements**|Finds and highlights all global elements in this file.|  
|**View Code**|Opens the file that contains the selected node in the XML Editor. The item that is selected in the XML Schema Explorer will also be selected in the XML Editor.|

|**View Code**|Opens the file that contains the selected node in the XML Editor. The item that is selected in the XML Schema Explorer will also be selected in the XML Editor.|  
|**Properties Window**|Opens the **Properties** window (if it is not already open). This window displays information about the node.|
