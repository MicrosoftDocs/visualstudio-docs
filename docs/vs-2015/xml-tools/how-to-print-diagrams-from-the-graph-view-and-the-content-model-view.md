# How to: Print Diagrams from the Graph View and the Content Model View
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This topic describes how to print a diagram from the Graph View or the Content Model View.  
  
### To print diagrams from the XML Schema Designer  
  
1. Open an XSD file in Visual Studio and add some nodes to the [XML Schema Designer Workspace](../xml-tools/xml-schema-designer-workspace.md).  
  
2. Export the diagram to an XPS file by using the **Export Diagram as Imageâ€¦** context menu item in the design surface of the Graph View or the Content Model View.  
  
     When you export a diagram from the Graph View, the whole design surface will be exported to the XPS file. When you export a diagram from the Content Model View and more than one node appears on the Content Model View's design surface, only the first node will be exported to the XPS file.  
  
3. Print the saved image in the XPS file by using an XPS viewer.
