# How to: Evaluate an XPath Expression
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can evaluate XPath expressions with the **QuickWatch** dialog box. The XPath expression must be valid according to the W3C XPath 1.0 recommendation. The current XSLT context—that is, the `self::node()` node in the **Locals** window—provides the evaluation context for the XPath expression.  
  
 The following list describes which functions are supported when evaluating an XPath expression:  
  
- Built-in XPath functions are supported.  
  
- Built-in XSLT functions are not supported.  
  
- User-defined functions are not supported.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure uses the belowAvg.xsl and books.xml files from the [Walkthrough: Debug an XSLT Style Sheet](../xml-tools/walkthrough-debug-an-xslt-style-sheet.md) topic.  
  
### To evaluate an XPath expression  
  
1. Insert a breakpoint at the `xsl:if` start tag.  
  
2. Click the **Debug XSL** button on the XML Editor toolbar.  
  
     The debugger starts and breaks on the `xsl:if` tag.  
  
3. Right-click and select **QuickWatch**.  
  
     The **QuickWatch** dialog box is displayed.  
  
4. Enter `./price/text()` in the **Expression** field of the **QuickWatch** dialog box and click **Reevaluate**.  
  
     The price of the current book node appears in the **Value** box.  
  
5. Change the XPath expression to `./price/text() < $bookAverage` and click **Reevaluate**.  
  
     The **Value** box shows that the XPath expression evaluates to `true`.
