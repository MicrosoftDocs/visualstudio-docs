# How to: Use Breakpoints with XSLT
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can set breakpoints in an XSLT style sheet or in the XML source document. If you set a breakpoint on a tag, when execution starts the breakpoint will move to the next statement that has source line information.  
  
 For more information, see [Debugging Basics: Breakpoints](https://msdn.microsoft.com/752a02c2-0ac7-4c8b-aa1b-4b2b3b21152e).  
  
## Set a Breakpoint in a Style Sheet  
 Breakpoints can be set on start tags, end tags, and text nodes of an XSLT style sheet. Breakpoints can also be set on code in a script block.  
  
#### To set a breakpoint in a style sheet  
  
1. Open a style sheet in the XML Editor.  
  
2. Position the cursor at the breakpoint location, right-click, point to **Breakpoint**, and click **Insert Breakpoint**.  
  
3. Click the browse the browse button (**...**) on the **Input** field of the document properties window.  
  
4. Locate the XML source document and click **Open**.  
  
     This sets the source document file that is used for the XSLT transformation.  
  
5. Click the **Debug XSL** button on the XML Editor toolbar.  
  
## Set a Breakpoint in an XML Source Document  
 Breakpoints can be set on elements, attributes, namespace node, comments, processing instruction, and text nodes of an XML source document. You cannot set a breakpoint on the document node, or on a namespace node that is inherited from the parent element.  
  
#### To set a breakpoint in an XML source document  
  
1. Open the XML document in the XML Editor.  
  
2. Position the cursor at the breakpoint location, right-click, point to **Breakpoint**, and click **Insert Breakpoint**.  
  
3. Click the browse the browse button (**...**) on the **Stylesheet** field of the document properties window.  
  
4. Locate the XML source document and click **Open**.  
  
     This sets the source document file that is used for the XSLT transformation.  
  
5. Click the **Debug XSL** button on the XML Editor toolbar.
