# Per Thread Summary Report
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This bar graph shows the proportion of time each unhidden thread spends in each activity category during the currently visible time range. "Execution" means that the thread is executing; all other categories mean that the thread is waiting for something.
