# Caller/Callee View - NET Memory Instrumentation Data
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Caller/Callee view of .NET memory profiling data that was collected by using the instrumentation method displays allocation and timing data for a selected function and the parent and child functions of that selected function. The Caller/Callee view contains three grids.  
  
 **Current function** is displayed in the middle grid, and it shows memory profiling information about the selected function. The values include all sampled calls to the function.  
  
 **Functions that called the current function** is displayed in the top grid, and it shows the amount of the value of the selected (current) function that was generated by calls from the caller (parent) function.  
  
 **Functions that were called by the current function** is displayed in the bottom grid, and it shows memory profiling data for the callee (child) functions of the selected function when the child function was called by the current function.  
  
 Double-click a caller or callee function row to make that row the current function.

## .NET Memory Allocation Values  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Exclusive Allocations**|-   For the current function, the number of objects that were created when the function was executing code in the function body (that is, when the function was at the top of the call stack). The number does not include objects that were created in functions that were called by this function.<br />-   For a caller function, the number of the exclusive allocations of the current function that were generated by calls from this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the number of objects that were created by instances of this function that were called by the current function. This number does not include objects that were created by functions that were called by the callee function.|  
|**Exclusive Allocations %**|The percentage of all objects that were created in the profiling run that were exclusive allocations of this function.|  
|**Inclusive Allocations**|-   For the current function, the number of objects that were allocated by the function in the profiling run. The number includes objects that were created in the callee functions that were called by the function.<br />-   For a caller function, the number of the inclusive allocations of the current function that were generated by calls from this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the number of objects that were allocated by the instances of this function that were generated by calls from the current function. The number includes allocations made by functions that were called by this callee function.|  
|**Inclusive Allocations %**|The percentage of all objects that were created in the profiling run that were inclusive allocations of this function.|

The number does not include memory that was allocated in callee functions that were called by the function.<br />-   For a caller function, the number of the exclusive bytes of the current function that were generated from calls by this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the number of bytes that were allocated by the instances of this function that were generated by calls from the current function. The number does not include bytes that were allocated by functions that were called by the callee function.|  
|**Exclusive Bytes %**|The percentage of all bytes of memory that were allocated in the profiling run that were exclusive allocations of this function.|  
|**Inclusive Bytes**|-   For the current function, the number of bytes in memory that were allocated by the function in the profiling run. The number includes memory that was allocated in callee functions that were called by the function.<br />-   For a caller function, the number of the inclusive bytes of the instances of the current function that were generated by calls from this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the number of bytes that were allocated by the instances of this function that were generated by calls from the current function. The number includes bytes that were allocated by functions that were called by this callee function.|  
|**Inclusive Bytes %**|The percentage of all bytes of memory that were allocated in the profiling run that were inclusive allocations of this function.|  
  
## Elapsed Inclusive Values  
 Elapsed inclusive values indicate the time that a function was on the call stack. The time includes time that was spent in child functions and in calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Elapsed Inclusive Time**|-   For the current function, the time that was spent in the function. The value includes time that was spent in child functions and in calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations.<br />-   For a caller function, the amount of the elapsed inclusive time of the current function that was generated by calls from this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the time that was spent in this function that was generated by calls from the current function. The value includes time that was spent in child functions and in calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations.|  
|**Elapsed Inclusive Time %**|The percentage of the total elapsed inclusive time of the profiling run that was spent in the elapsed inclusive time of this function in this context.|  
|**Avg Elapsed Inclusive Time**|The average elapsed inclusive time of a call to this function in this context.|  
|**Max Elapsed Inclusive Time**|The maximum elapsed inclusive time of a call to this function in this context.|  
|**Min Elapsed Inclusive Time**|The minimum elapsed inclusive time of a call to this function in this context.|  
  
## Elapsed Exclusive Values  
 Elapsed exclusive values indicate the time that a function was directly executing at the top of the call stack. The time includes time in calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations, but it does not include time that was spent in child functions.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Elapsed Exclusive Time**|-   For the current function, the time that was spent in the execution of the body of the function. The value excludes time that was spent in child functions, but includes calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations.<br />-   For a caller function, the amount of the elapsed exclusive time of the current function that was generated by calls from this caller function.<br />-   For a callee function, the time that was spent in this function that was generated by calls from the current function. The value excludes time that was spent in child functions of the callee function, but includes calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations.|

|**Min Elapsed Exclusive Time**|The minimum elapsed exclusive time of a call to this function in this context.|  
  
## Application Inclusive Values  
 Application inclusive values indicate the time that a function was on the call stack. The time does not include time that was spent in calls to the operating system, such as context switches and input/output operations, but it does include time that was spent in child functions.  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|
