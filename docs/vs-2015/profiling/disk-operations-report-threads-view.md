# Disk Operations Report (Threads View)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Disk Operations Report shows disk I/O operations in the disk channels.  
  
 For each disk access that occurs on behalf of the process that's being profiled in the currently visible time window, this information is reported:  
  
- The name and PID of the process that performed the disk access  
  
- The ID of the thread that accessed the disk  
  
- The name of the file that was accessed  
  
- The number of reads per file  
  
- The number of bytes read  
  
- The read latency, in milliseconds  
  
- The number of writes  
  
- The number of bytes written  
  
- The write latency, in milliseconds
