# Instruction Pointers (IPs) View - Sampling Data
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The IPs view of sampling data lists performance data for the assembly instructions that were directly executing when the samples were collected in the profiling run.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).  
  
|Column|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Process ID**|The process ID (PID) of the profiling run.|  
|**Process Name**|The name of the process.|  
|**Module Name**|The name of the module that contains the instruction.|  
|**Module Path**|The path of the module that contains the instruction.|  
|**Source File**|The source file that contains the instruction.|  
|**Function Name**|The name of the function that contains the instruction.|  
|**Function Line Number**|The line number of the start of this function in the source file.|  
|**Function Address**|The starting memory address of the function in the loaded binary.|  
|**Source Line Begin**|The starting line number in the source file at which this sample was collected.|  
|**Source Line End**|The ending line number in the source file at which this sample was collected.|  
|**Source Character Begin**|The offset of the starting character in the source file line at which this sample was collected.|  
|**Source Character End**|The offset of the ending character in the source file line at which this sample was collected.|  
|**Instruction Address**|The address of the instruction in the loaded binary.|  
|**Exclusive Samples**|The total number of samples that were collected when the instruction was executing.|  
|**Exclusive Samples %**|The percentage of all samples in the profiling run that were collected when the instruction was executing.|
