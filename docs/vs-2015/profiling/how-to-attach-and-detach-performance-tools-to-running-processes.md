# How to: Attach and Detach Performance Tools to Running Processes
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The profiler can be used to attach to or detach from a running process to make sampling and gathering performance data easier. You can use this method to profile a process when you want to avoid gathering data about application load time, or to monitor the performance of a process after it reaches a specific state.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The following steps apply to attaching and detaching processes from within the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] integrated development environmnent (IDE). For information about how to use command line tools, see [Profiling from the Command-Line](../profiling/using-the-profiling-tools-from-the-command-line.md). For information about how to profile services, see [Profiling Services](../profiling/command-line-profiling-of-services.md).  
  
 The processes that are available to profile depend on the User Access Permissions that are set by an administrator of the computer. A User account may, for example, have permission for any of the following:  
  
- Advanced profiling features, when the administrator has set the driver and service to start.  
  
- Sample profiling only (domain users).  
  
- Deny access to profiling to everybody.  
  
  For more information, see [Profiling and Windows Vista Security](../profiling/profiling-and-windows-vista-security.md) and the ADMIN options in [VSPerfCmd](../profiling/vsperfcmd.md).  
  
### To attach to a running process  
  
1. On the **Analyze** menu, point to **Profiler** and then click **Attach/Detach**.  
  
     \- or -  
  
     In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session, and then click **Attach/Detach**.
