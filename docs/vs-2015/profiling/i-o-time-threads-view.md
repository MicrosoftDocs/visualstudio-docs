# I/O Time (Threads View)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

These segments in the timeline are associated with blocking times that are categorized as I/O. This means that a thread is waiting for an I/O operation to finish. The thread may have been blocked in an API, or by an I/O-related kernel wait that the Concurrency Visualizer is counting as I/O. APIs such as `CreateFile()`, `ReadFile()`, and `WSARecv()` fall into this group.
