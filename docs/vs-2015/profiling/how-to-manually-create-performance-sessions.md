# How to: Manually Create Performance Sessions
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can manually create a performance session. You are not required to open a project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] to do this. For more information, see [Configuring Performance Sessions](../profiling/configuring-performance-sessions.md).  
  
### To manually create a performance session  
  
1. On the **Analyze** menu, point to **Profiler**, and then click **New Performance Session**.  
  
     An empty performance session is added to **Performance Explorer**.  
  
2. Right-click **Targets**, and then click **Add Target Binary**.  
  
3. In the **Add Target Binary** dialog box, select the file name, and then click **Open**.  
  
     A new binary is added.
