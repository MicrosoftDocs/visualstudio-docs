# What&#39;s New in Profiling Tools
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

For information about everything that’s new in Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 debugging and diagnostics, see [Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 Release Notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-update1-vs#debug).

## What's New in Update 1  
 Starting in Visual Studio 2015 Update 1, you can see a per-function breakdown of CPU usage without leaving the debugger. For more information, see [Profile Your CPU in the Debugger in Visual Studio 2015](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/10/29/profile-your-cpu-in-the-debugger-in-visual-studio-2015.aspx).  
  
 The **Diagnostic Tools** window has added search and filter options to the **Events** tab. For more information, see [Debugger-integrated profiling](/visualstudio/profiling/running-profiling-tools-with-or-without-the-debugger) and  [Searching and filtering the Events tab of the Diagnostic Tools window](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/11/12/searching-and-filtering-the-events-tab-of-the-diagnostic-tools-window.aspx).  
  
## Diagnostics with debugging UI and hotkey changes  
 You can now run diagnostic tools while debugging with the new **Diagnostic Tools** window. The window appears automatically, but you can also open it with the new menu item **Show Diagnostic Tools** (keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+F2**).  
  
## Diagnostics without debugging UI and hotkey changes  
 To run diagnostics without debugging, go to **Debug / Start Diagnostics tools Without Debugging** or **Debug / Profiler / Performance Profiler...**. In Visual Studio 2013, this was found in **Analyze / Performance and Diagnostics** or **Debug / Performance and Diagnostics**.  
  
 The **Performance Explorer** can now be found in **Debug / Profiler / Performance Explorer**. In Visual Studio 2013 it was found in **Analyze / Profiler**.  
  
 The keyboard shortcut for the **Debug / Stop Collection** command (which applies when running **Diagnostics Tools Without Debugging**) has been changed from **CTRL +ALT+F2** in Visual Studio 2013 to **CTRL+SHIFT+F2** in Visual Studio 2015.  
  
 Windows Phone Application Analysis Tools are available from the **Debug / Profiler / Windows Phone Application Analysis Tools** (or **ALT+F1**).
