# DA0005: Frequent GC2 collections

|Message type|Warning|  
  
## Cause  
 A high number of .NET memory objects are being reclaimed in generation 2 garbage collection.  
  
## Rule Description  
 The Microsoft .NET common language runtime (CLR) provides an automatic memory management mechanism that uses a garbage collector to reclaim memory from objects that the application no longer uses. The garbage collector is generation-oriented, based on the assumption that many allocations are short-lived. Local variables, for example, should be short-lived. Newly created objects start in generation 0 (gen 0), and then they progress to generation 1 when they survive a garbage collection run, and finally transition to generation 2 if the application still uses them.  
  
 Objects in generation 0 are collected frequently and usually very efficiently. Objects in generation 1 are collected less frequently and less efficiently. Finally, long-lived objects in generation 2 should be collected even less frequently. Generation 2 collection, which is a full garbage collection run, is also the most expensive operation.  
  
 This rule fires when proportionally too many generation 2 garbage collections have occurred. If too many relatively short-lived objects survive generation 1 collection but are then able to be collected in a generation 2 full collection, the cost of memory management can easily become excessive. For more information, see the [Mid-life crisis](https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/ricom/mid-life-crisis) post on the Rico Mariani's Performance Tidbits on the MSDN Web site.  
  
## How to Investigate a Warning  
 Review the [.NET Memory Data Views](../profiling/dotnet-memory-data-views.md) reports to understand the application’s pattern of memory allocation. Use the [Object Lifetime View](../profiling/object-lifetime-view.md) to determine which of the program’s data objects are surviving into generation 2 and then being reclaimed from there. Use the [Allocations View](../profiling/dotnet-memory-allocations-view.md) to determine the execution path that resulted in these allocations.
