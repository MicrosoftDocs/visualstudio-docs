# Cores View Logical Cores
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Each channel name represents one of the logical cores that exist on the profiled system. The naming counts up from 0 to the total number of logical cores. For example, a four-core system will count from logical core 0 to logical core 3.
