# Average CPU Utilization
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Shows the profiled process’s average utilization of the system’s logical cores for the duration of the process. The graph does not show which specific core is active at any given time. For example, if two cores are each running at 50% capacity for a given time period, then this view will show one logical core being utilized.
