# How to: Start and End Performance Data Collection
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You must add the target binary that you want to profile to the performance session before you start profiling. To add a target, right-click **Targets** in **Performance Explorer**, and then click **Add Target Binary**. In the **Add Target Binary** dialog box, select the file name, and then click **Open**. A new binary is added.  
  
### To start profiling  
  
1. Right-click the name of the performance session on the **Performance Explorer** window and choose one of the following options:  
  
    - **Launch with Profiling** - starts the application and immediately begins profiling.  
  
    - **Launch with Profiling Paused** - starts the application but does not begin profiling. You can start profiling by selecting **Resume Collection** in the **Data Collection Control** window. For more information, see [How to: Pause and Resume Performance Data Collection](../profiling/how-to-pause-and-resume-performance-data-collection.md).  
  
### To end profiling  
  
- The preferred method of ending a profiling session is to exit the application. To immediately stop profiling, on the **Performance Explorer** toolbar, click **Stop**.
