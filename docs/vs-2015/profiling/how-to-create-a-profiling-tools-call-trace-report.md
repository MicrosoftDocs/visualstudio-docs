# How to: Create a Profiling Tools Call Trace Report
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The  *call trace report* for the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Profiling Tools lists timing information for each entry and exit point to your application's functions and each call to other functions by your function. Call trace reports are available for profiling data only if it was collected with the instrumentation method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot display call trace reports in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. You must use the **VSPerfReport** command-line tool to generate a comma-separated value (.csv) or Xml file. For more information about this tool, see [VSPerfReport](../profiling/vsperfreport.md).  
  
### To create a call trace report  
  
1. Open a **Command Prompt**ine window.  
  
2. At the command prompt, type the following command:  
  
     *ToolsPath* **VSPerfReport** *VSPFile*  **/CallTrace [/Xml]**  
  
    |Command element|Description|
    |-|-|  
    |*ToolsPath*|The path of Profiling Tools command line tools. For more information, see [Specifying the Path to Command Line Tools](../profiling/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).|  
    |*VSPFile*|The profiling data (.vsp or .vsps) file. Full and partial paths are accepted.|  
    |Xml|Generates an Xml formatted report.|
