# How to: Choose Sampling Events
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

By default, the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Profiling Tools collects performance data at an interval that is specified as a number of processor cycles that are used by the profiled process. The default number of cycles in an interval is 10,000,000, which is approximately 0.01 seconds on a 1 GH computer. You can change the number of cycles in an interval, and you can change the sample event. The following sample events are available:  
  
- Clock cycles - for CPU-bound problems.  
  
- Page faults - for memory-related problems.  
  
- System calls - for I/O-related problems.  
  
- Performance counter - CPU counters for low-level performance problems.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are collecting .NET memory data (allocations or object lifetimes, or both) by using the sampling method, all user-specified sampling events are ignored and the appropriate memory allocations or garbage collection events, or both, are used to collect data.  
  
### To select a sample event  
  
1. In **Performance Explorer**, right-click the performance session, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2. In the **Property Pages**, click the **Sampling** properties.  
  
3. From the **Sample event** drop-down list, select the sample event you want to use to profile your application.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Available performance counters** are enabled only if you select **Performance counter** from the **Sample event** drop-down list.  
  
4. If you select **Performance counter**, select a specific CPU counter from the **Available performance counters** tree view control.  
  
    - Counters in the **Portable Events** node are available on all types of processors.  
  
    - Counters in the **Platform Events** node are specific to the processor on the current computer and might not be available on other types of processors.  
  
5. When you select a sample event, a default sampling interval value is displayed in the **Sampling interval** text box. If necessary, you can enter the value that you want in the text box.
