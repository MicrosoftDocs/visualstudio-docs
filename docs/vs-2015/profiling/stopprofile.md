# StopProfile
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The `StopProfile` function sets the counter to 0 (off) for the specified profiling level.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
PROFILE_COMMAND_STATUS PROFILERAPI StopProfile(  
                       PROFILE_CONTROL_LEVEL Level,   
                       unsigned int dwId);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Level`  
  
 Indicates the profile level to which performance data collection can be applied. The following **PROFILE_CONTROL_LEVEL** enumerators can be used to indicate one of the three levels to which performance data collection can be applied:  
  
|Enumerator|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|PROFILE_GLOBALLEVEL|Global level setting affects all processes and threads in the profiling run.|  
|PROFILE_PROCESSLEVEL|Process level setting affect all threads that are part of specified process.|  
|PROFILE_THREADLEVEL|Thread profiling Level setting affects the specified thread.|  
  
 `dwId`  
  
 The process or thread identifier generated by the system.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 The function indicates success or failure by using **PROFILE_COMMAND_STATUS** enumeration. The return value can be one of the following:  
  
|Enumerator|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|PROFILE_ERROR_ID_NOEXIST|The profiling element ID does not exist.|  
|PROFILE_ERROR_LEVEL_NOEXIST|The profiling level specified does not exist.|  
|PROFILE_ERROR_MODE_NEVER|The profiling mode was set to NEVER when the function was called.|  
|PROFILE_ERROR_NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED|The profiling function call, profiling level, or combination of call and level is not yet implemented.|  
|PROFILE_OK|The call was successful.|  
  
## Remarks  
 StartProfile and StopProfile control the Start/Stop state for the profiling level. The default value of Start/Stop is 1. The initial value can be changed in the registry. Each call to StartProfile sets Start/Stop to 1; each call to StopProfile sets it to 0.  
  
 When the Start/Stop is greater than 0, the Start/Stop state for the level is ON. When it is less than or equal to 0, the Start/Stop state is OFF.  
  
 When the Start/Stop state and the Suspend/Resume state are both ON, the profiling state for the level is ON. For a thread to be profiled, the global, process, and thread level states for the thread must be ON.  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Microsoft.VisualStudio.Profiler.dll  
  
## Function Information  
 Header: Declared in VSPerf.h  
  
 Import library: VSPerf.lib  
  
## Example  
 The following example illustrates the StopProfile method. The example assumes that a call to the StartProfile method has been made for the same thread or process identified by [PROFILE_CURRENTID](../profiling/profile-currentid.md).  
  
```  
void ExerciseStopProfile()  
{  
    // StartProfile and StopProfile control the   
    // Start/Stop state for the profiling level.   
    // The default initial value of Start/Stop is 1.   
    // The initial value can be changed in the registry.   
    // Each call to StartProfile sets Start/Stop to 1;   
    // each call to StopProfile sets it to 0.   
  
    // Variables used to print output.  
    HRESULT hResult;  
    TCHAR tchBuffer[256];  
  
    // Declare enumeration to hold result of call  
    // to StopProfile.  
    PROFILE_COMMAND_STATUS profileResult;  
  
    profileResult = StopProfile(  
        PROFILE_THREADLEVEL,  
        PROFILE_CURRENTID);  
  
    // Format and print result.  
    LPCTSTR pszFormat = TEXT("%s %d.\0");  
    TCHAR* pszTxt = TEXT("StopProfile returned");  
    hResult = StringCchPrintf(tchBuffer, 256, pszFormat,   
        pszTxt, profileResult);  
  
#ifdef DEBUG  
    OutputDebugString(tchBuffer);  
#endif  
}  
```
