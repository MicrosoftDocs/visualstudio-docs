# VSSDK Samples
The official home for Visual Studio Extensibility samples is the [MSDN Code Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=127810) Web site. The site contains introductory samples, samples that illustrate new features in Visual Studio, deep dive documentation, links to shared source projects, and other resources to help you extend Visual Studio. To see a list of these resources, type **VSX** in the **Search for Samples** box on the home page.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] SDK samples demonstrate how to integrate an extension into the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). The source code directory of every sample includes a document named Overview.xml, which contains implementation notes for that sample.  
  
 An IronPython sample is also available. It is integrated with the [IronPython Studio project](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=183554) on the CodePlex Web site.
