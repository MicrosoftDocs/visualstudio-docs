# ^ operator (C++)
The `^` operator has two meanings in Visual C++, depending on its context. For more information see:  
  
-   [Bitwise Exclusive OR Operator: ^](../Topic/Bitwise%20Exclusive%20OR%20Operator:%20%5E.md), for use in all flavors of C++.  
  
-   [Handle to Object Operator (^)](../Topic/Handle%20to%20Object%20Operator%20\(%5E\)%20%20\(C++%20Component%20Extensions\).md), for use in [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../includes/cppwrt-short-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../includes/cppcli-md.md)]
