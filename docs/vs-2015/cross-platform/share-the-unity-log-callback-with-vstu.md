# Share the Unity Log Callback with VSTU
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Visual Studio Tools for Unity registers a log callback with Unity to be able to stream its console to Visual Studio. If your editor scripts also register a log callback with Unity, the VSTU callback might interfere with your callback. To prevent this possibility, use the `VisualStudioIntegration.LogCallback` event to cooperate with VSTU.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 How to share the Unity Log Callback created by Visual Studio Tools for Unity.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
  
using UnityEngine;  
using UnityEditor;  
  
using SyntaxTree.VisualStudio.Unity.Bridge;  
  
[InitializeOnLoad]  
public class LogCallbackHook  
{  
    static LogCallbackHook()  
    {  
        VisualStudioIntegration.LogCallback += (string condition, string trace, LogType type) =>  
        {  
            // place code that implements your log callback here  
        };  
    }  
}  
```
