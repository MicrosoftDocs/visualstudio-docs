# Walkthrough: LinqToXmlDataBinding Example
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This walkthrough describes the LinqToXmlDataBinding example, and explains some of the more interesting contents of its two primary source files, L2DBForm.xaml and L2DBForm.xaml.cs.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before you read this walkthrough, we highly recommended that you build and run the LinqToXmlDataBinding program as described in [How to: Build and Run the LinqToXmlDataBinding Example](../designers/how-to-build-and-run-the-linqtoxmldatabinding-example.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The LinqToXmlDataBinding program is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that is composed of C# and XAML source files. It contains an embedded XML document that defines a list of books, and enables the user to view, add, delete, and edit these entries. It is composed of the following two primary source files:  
  
- L2DBForm.xaml contains the XAML declaration code for the user interface (UI) of the main window. It also contains a window resource section that defines a data provider and embedded XML document for the book listings.  
  
- L2DBForm.xaml.cs contains the initialization and event-handling methods associated with the UI.  
  
  The main window is divided into the following four vertical UI sections:  
  
- **XML** displays the raw XML source of the embedded book listing.  
  
- **Book List** displays the book entries as standard text and enables the user to select and delete individual entries.  
  
- **Edit Selected Book** enables the user to edit the values associated with the currently selected book entry.  
  
- **Add New Book** enables the creation of a new book entry based on values entered by the user.
