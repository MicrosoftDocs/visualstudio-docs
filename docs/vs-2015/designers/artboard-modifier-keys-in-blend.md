# Artboard modifier keys in Blend
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Some keyboard shortcuts do not have associated menu items, which means that you can't use the [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../includes/blend-subs-md.md)] user interface to discover them. The following table lists shortcuts that modify an action, such as resizing an object.

|To do this action|Do this|
