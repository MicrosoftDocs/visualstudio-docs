# Install Multiple Language Versions of Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

For the latest documentation on Visual Studio, see [Install language packs](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#step-6---install-language-packs-optional).

By installing one or more language packages, you can run Visual Studio 2015 in other languages on the same computer. You must obtain a separate language package for each language that you want to install.

## Important Considerations

- When you install a language package, resource files for the installed features are automatically installed for each language version.

- Visual Studio service packages apply to all installed language versions of Visual Studio. You no longer need to install a service package for each language version of Visual Studio that you've installed.

- You can uninstall language packages by using the maintenance mode of Visual Studio setup. Open **Control Panel**, open **Programs and Features**, choose your edition of Visual Studio, and then choose **Uninstall/Change**.
