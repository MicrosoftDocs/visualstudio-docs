## <a name="custom"></a> Default vs. Custom Setup
 When you install Visual Studio 2015, you can  include or exclude components that you'd use on a daily basis. This means that a Default installation will often be smaller and install faster than a Custom installation. It also means that many components that were installed by default in previous versions now are considered Custom components that you must explicitly select in this version.

 ![Visual Studio 2015 Setup Dialog](../ide/media/vs2015-setup-screen.png "VS2015_Setup_screen")

 Custom components include Visual C++, Visual F#, SQL Server Data Tools, cross-platform mobile tools and SDKs, and third-party SDKs and extensions. You can install any of the custom components at a later time if you don't select them during the initial setup.

> [!NOTE]
> A Custom installation automatically includes the components that are in a Default installation.

 The complete list of Custom components is as follows:

|Feature Sets|Components|
|------------------|----------------|
|**Updates**|Visual Studio 2015 Update 3|
|**Programming Languages**|Visual C++<br />Visual F#<br />Python Tools for Visual Studio|

## <a name="installing"></a> Install Visual Studio
 You can install Visual Studio by using installation media (DVDs), by using your Visual Studio subscription service from the [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?q=visual%20studio%20enterprise%202015) website, by downloading  a web installer from the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) website, or by creating an offline installation layout (see the [Create an Offline Installation of Visual Studio](../install/create-an-offline-installation-of-visual-studio.md) page for more details).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need administrator credentials to install [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. However, you don't need them to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] after you install it.

 Your local administrator account must have the following privileges enabled to install everything in Visual Studio.

|Local Policy Object Display Name|User Right|
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
|Backup Files and directories|SeBackupPrivilege|
|Debug programs|SeDebugPrivilege|
|Manage auditing and security log|SeSecurityPrivilege|

 For more information on this local administrator account requirement, see the Knowledge Base article, [SQL Server installation fails if the Setup account does not have certain user rights](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2000257).

### <a name="BKMK_Media"></a> Use installation media
 To install [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], in the root directory on the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] installation media, run the installation file for the edition you want:

|Edition|Installation File|
|-------------|-----------------------|
|Visual Studio Enterprise|vs_enterprise.exe|
|Visual Studio Professional|vs_professional.exe|
|Visual Studio Community|vs_community.exe|

### <a name="BKMK_Website"></a> Download from the product website
 Visit the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) page, and select the edition of Visual Studio that you want.

### Download from your subscription service
 Visit  the [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?q=visual%20studio%20enterprise%202015) page, and select the edition of Visual Studio that you want.

### <a name="BKMK_Offline"></a> Create an offline installation layout
 If you do not have the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] installation media, or you do not have a Visual Studio subscription,  or you do not want to install [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by using the web installer, you can perform a "disconnected" installation by creating what is known as an offline installation layout. For more information, see the [Create an Offline Installation of Visual Studio](../install/create-an-offline-installation-of-visual-studio.md) page.

## <a name="enterprise"></a> Deploy Visual Studio in an enterprise
 For information about how to deploy [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] over a network, see the [Visual Studio Administrator Guide](../install/visual-studio-administrator-guide.md).

### <a name="BKMK_Virtualized"></a> Install Visual Studio in a virtualized environment
 **Video Issues with Hyper-V**

 If you run Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V enabled and an accelerated graphics adapter, you may experience system slowdowns.

 For more information, see [Video performance may decrease when a Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2 based computer has the Hyper-V role enabled and an accelerated display adapter installed](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/961661).

 **Emulating Devices with Hyper-V**

 When you install Visual Studio 2015 on real hardware without virtualization, you can choose features that enable emulation of Windows and Android devices using Hyper-V. When you install into Hyper-V, you will not be able to emulate the Windows or Android devices. This is because the emulators are themselves virtual machines, and you cannot currently host a VM inside another VM. The workaround is to have real Windows or Android devices to which you can directly deploy and debug your application.

## <a name="optionalComponents"></a> Install optional components
 If you want to install components that you might not have selected during your original installation, use the following procedure.

#### To install optional components

1. In **Control Panel**, on the **Programs and Features** page, choose the product edition to which you want to add one or more components, and then choose **Change**.

2. In the Setup wizard, choose **Modify**, and then choose the components that you want to install.

3. Choose **Next**, and then follow the remaining instructions.

## <a name="helpContent"></a> Install offline Help content
 After you install [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you can download additional Help content so that it will be available offline.

#### To install or uninstall Help content

1. On the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] menu bar, choose **Help**, **Add and Remove Help Content**.

2. On the **Manage Content** tab of the **Microsoft Help Viewer**, select the installation source for your Help content.

3. If you're looking for a specific Help collection, enter the name or a keyword in the **Search** text box, and then press **Enter**.

4. Next to the name of the Help collection you want, choose the **Add** or **Remove** link.

5. Click the **Update** button.

   For more information about how to install or deploy offline Help, see the [Help Viewer Administrator Guide](../ide/help-viewer-administrator-guide.md).

## <a name="serviceReleases"></a> Check for Service Releases and Product Updates
 Because not all extensions are compatible, Visual Studio doesn't automatically upgrade extensions when you upgrade from previous versions. You must reinstall the extensions from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) or from the software publisher.

#### To automatically check for service releases

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Options**.

2. In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Environment**, and then select **Extensions and Updates**. Make sure the **Automatically check for updates** check box is selected, and then choose **OK**.

## Register Visual Studio

1. On the menu bar, choose **Help**, **About**.

     The **About** dialog box shows the product identification number (PID). You'll need the PID and Windows Account credentials (such as a Hotmail or Outlook.com email address and password) to register the product.

2. On the menu bar, choose **Help**, **Register Product**.

## <a name="repair"></a> Repair Visual Studio

#### To repair Visual Studio

1. In **Control Panel**, on the **Programs and Features** page, choose the product edition that you want to repair, and then choose **Change**.

2. In the Setup wizard, choose **Repair**, choose **Next**, and then follow the remaining instructions.

#### To repair Visual Studio in silent or passive modes (that is, to repair from source)

1. On the computer where Visual Studio is installed, open the Windows command prompt.

2. Enter the following parameters:

     *DVDRoot* \\<*Installation File*\> \<`/quiet|/passive`> [/`norestart`]/`Repair`

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshoot an installation
 Use these resources to get help for setup and installation issues:
