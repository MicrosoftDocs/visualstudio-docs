# Walkthrough: Creating LINQ to SQL Classes by Using Single-Table Inheritance (O/R Designer)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The [LINQ to SQL Tools in Visual Studio](../data-tools/linq-to-sql-tools-in-visual-studio2.md) supports single-table inheritance as it is typically implemented in relational systems. This walkthrough expands upon the generic steps provided in the [How to: Configure inheritance by using the O/R Designer](../data-tools/how-to-configure-inheritance-by-using-the-o-r-designer.md) topic and provides some real data to demonstrate the use of inheritance in the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)].

 During this walkthrough, you will perform the following tasks:

- Create a database table and add data to it.

- Create a Windows Forms application.

- Add a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] file to a project.

- Create new entity classes.

- Configure the entity classes to use inheritance.

- Query the inherited class.

- Display the data on a Windows Form.

## Create a Table to Inherit From
 To see how inheritance works, you will create a small Person table, use it as a base class, and then create an Employee object that inherits from it.

#### To create a base table to demonstrate inheritance

1. In **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer**, right-click the **Tables** node and click **Add New Table**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use the Northwind database or any other database that you can add a table to.

2. In the Table Designer, add the following columns to the table:

    |Column Name|Data Type|Allow Nulls|
    |-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
    |**ID**|**int**|**False**|
    |**Type**|**int**|**True**|
    |**FirstName**|**nvarchar(200)**|**False**|
    |**LastName**|**nvarchar(200)**|**False**|
    |**Manager**|**int**|**True**|

3. Set the ID column as the primary key.

4. Save the table and name it **Person**.

## Add Data to the Table
 So that you can verify that inheritance is configured correctly, the table needs some data for each class in the single-table inheritance.

#### To add data to the table

1. Open the table in data view. (Right-click the **Person** table in **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** and click **Show Table Data**.)

2. Copy the following data into the table. (You can copy it and then paste it into the table by selecting the whole row in the Results Pane.)

    |**ID**|**Type**|**FirstName**|**LastName**|**Manager**|
    |-|-|-|-|-|
    |**1**|**1**|**Anne**|**Wallace**|**NULL**|
    |**2**|**1**|**Carlos**|**Grilo**|**NULL**|
    |**3**|**1**|**Yael**|**Peled**|**NULL**|
    |**4**|**2**|**Gatis**|**Ozolins**|**1**|
    |**5**|**2**|**Andreas**|**Hauser**|**1**|
    |**6**|**2**|**Tiffany**|**Phuvasate**|**1**|
    |**7**|**2**|**Alexey**|**Orekhov**|**2**|
    |**8**|**2**|**MichaÅ‚**|**Poliszkiewicz**|**2**|
    |**9**|**2**|**Tai**|**Yee**|**2**|
    |**10**|**2**|**Fabricio**|**Noriega**|**3**|
    |**11**|**2**|**Mindy**|**Martin**|**3**|
    |**12**|**2**|**Ken**|**Kwok**|**3**|

## Create a New Project
 Now that you have created the table, create a new project to demonstrate configuring inheritance.

#### To create the new Windows Application

1. From the **File** menu, create a new project.

2. Name the project **InheritanceWalkthrough**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] is supported in Visual Basic and C# projects. Create the new project in one of these languages.

3. Click the **Windows Forms Application** template and then click **OK**. For more information, see [Client Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2dfb50b7-5af2-4e12-9bbb-c5ade0e39a68).

4. The InheritanceWalkthrough project is created and added to **Solution Explorer**.

## Add a LINQ to SQL Classes File to the Project

#### To add a LINQ to SQL File to the project

1. On the **Project** menu, click **Add New Item**.

2. Click the **LINQ to SQL Classes** template and then click **Add**.

     The .dbml file is added to the project and the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] opens.

## Create the Inheritance by Using the O/R Designer
 Configure the inheritance by dragging an **Inheritance** object from the **Toolbox** onto the design surface.

#### To create the inheritance

1. In **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer**, navigate to the **Person** table that you created earlier.

2. Drag the **Person** table onto the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] design surface.

3. Drag a second **Person** table onto the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] and change its name to **Employee**.

4. Delete the **Manager** property from the **Person** object.

5. Delete the **Type**, **ID**, **FirstName**, and **LastName** properties from the **Employee** object. (In other words, delete all properties except for **Manager**.)

6. From the **Object Relational Designer** tab of the **Toolbox**, create an **Inheritance** between the **Person** and **Employee** objects. To do this, click the **Inheritance** item in the **Toolbox** and release the mouse button. Next, click the **Employee** object and then the **Person** object in the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)]. The arrow on the inheritance line will point to the **Person** object.

7. Click the **Inheritance** line on the design surface.

8. Set the **Discriminator Property** property to **Type**.

9. Set the **Derived Class Discriminator Value** property to **2**.

10. Set the **Base Class Discriminator Value** property to **1**.

11. Set the **Inheritance Default** property to **Person**.

12. Build the project.

## Query the Inherited Class and Display the Data on the Form
 You will now add some code to the form that queries for a specific class in the object model.

#### To create a LINQ query and display the results on the form

1. Drag a **ListBox** onto Form1.

2. Double-click the form to create a `Form1_Load` event handler.

3. Add the following code to the `Form1_Load` event handler:

    ```vb
    Dim dc As New DataClasses1DataContext
    Dim results = From emp In dc.Persons _
        Where TypeOf emp Is Employee _
        Select emp

    For Each Emp As Employee In results
        ListBox1.Items.Add(Emp.LastName)
    Next
    ```

    ```csharp
    NorthwindDataContext dc = new DataClasses1DataContext();
    var results = from emp in dc.Persons
                  where emp is Employee
                  select emp;

    foreach(Employee Emp in results)
    {
        listBox1.Items.Add(Emp.LastName)
    }
    ```

## Test the Application
 Run the application and verify that the records displayed in the list box are all employees (records that have a value of 2 in their Type column).

#### To test the application

1. Press F5.

2. Verify that only records that have a value of 2 in their Type column are displayed.

3. Close the form. (On the **Debug** menu, click **Stop Debugging**.)
