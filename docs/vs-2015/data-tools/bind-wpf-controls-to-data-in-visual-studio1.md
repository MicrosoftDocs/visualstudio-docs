# Bind WPF controls to data in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can display data to users of your application by binding data to [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlewinclient](../includes/tlasharptla-titlewinclient-md.md)] controls. To create these data-bound controls, you can drag items from the **Data Sources** window onto the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. This topic describes some of the most common tasks, tools, and classes that you can use to create data-bound [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlewinclient](../includes/tlasharptla-titlewinclient-md.md)] applications.

 For general information about how to create data-bound controls in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md). For more information about [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlewinclient](../includes/tlasharptla-titlewinclient-md.md)] data binding, see [Data Binding Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c707c95f-7811-401d-956e-2fffd019a211).

## Tasks involved in binding WPF controls to data
 The following table lists the tasks that can be accomplished by dragging items from the **Data Sources** window to the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].

|Task|More information|
|----------|----------------------|
|Create new data-bound controls.<br /><br /> Bind existing controls to data.|[Bind WPF controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio2.md) [Bind WPF controls to a dataset](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-a-dataset.md)|
|Create controls that display related data in a parent-child relationship: when the user selects a parent data record in one control, another control displays related child data for the selected record.|[Display related data in WPF applications](../data-tools/display-related-data-in-wpf-applications.md)|
|Create a *lookup table* that displays information from one table based on the value of a foreign-key field in another table.|[Create lookup tables in WPF applications](../data-tools/create-lookup-tables-in-wpf-applications.md)|
|Bind a control to an image in a database.|[Bind controls to pictures from a database](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-pictures-from-a-database.md)|

## Valid drop targets
 You can drag items in the **Data Sources** window only to valid drop targets in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)]. There are two main kinds of valid drop targets: containers and controls. A container is a user interface element that typically contains controls. For example, a grid is a container, and so is a window.

## Generated XAML and code
 When you drag an item from the **Data Sources** window to the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that defines a new data-bound control (or binds an existing control to the data source). For some data sources, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] also generates code in the code-behind file that fills the data source with data.

 The following table lists the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] and code that [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates for each type of data source in the **Data Sources** window.

|Data source|Generate XAML that binds a control to the data source|Generate code that fills the data source with data|
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Dataset|Yes|Yes|
|[!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)]|Yes|Yes|
|Service|Yes|No|
|Object|Yes|No|

### Datasets
 When you drag a table or column from the **Data Sources** window to the designer, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that does the following:

- Adds the dataset and a new <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> to the resources of the container you dragged the item to. The <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> is an object that can be used to navigate and display the data in the dataset.

- Creates a data binding for a control. If you drag the item to an existing control in the designer, the XAML binds the control to the item. If you drag the item to a container, the XAML creates the control that was selected for the dragged item, and it binds the control to the item. The control is created inside a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.

  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] also makes the following changes to the code-behind file:

- Creates a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] element that contains the control. The event handler fills the table with data, retrieves the <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> from the container's resources, and then makes the first data item the current item. If a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler already exists, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] adds this code to the existing event handler.

### Entity data models
 When you drag an entity or an entity property from the **Data Sources** window to the designer, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that does the following:

- Adds a new <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> to the resources of the container you dragged the item to. The <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> is an object that can be used to navigate and display the data in the entity.

- Creates a data binding for a control. If you drag the item to an existing control in the designer, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] binds the control to the item. If you drag the item to a container, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] creates the control that was selected for the dragged item, and it binds the control to the item. The control is created inside a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.

  Visual Studio also makes the following changes to the code-behind file:

- Adds a new method that returns a query for the entity that you dragged to the designer (or the entity that contains the property that you dragged to the designer). The new method has the name Get*EntityName*Query, where *EntityName* is the name of the entity.

- Creates a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] element that contains the control. The event handler calls the Get*EntityName*Query method to fill the entity with data, retrieves the <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> from the container's resources, and then makes the first data item the current item. If a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler already exists, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] adds this code to the existing event handler.

### Services
 When you drag a service object or property from the **Data Sources** window to the designer, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that creates a data-bound control (or binds an existing control to the object or property). However, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] does not generate code that fills the proxy service object with data. You must write this code yourself. For an example that demonstrates how to do this, see [Bind WPF controls to a WCF data service](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-a-wcf-data-service.md).

 Visual Studio generates XAML that does the following:

- Adds a new <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> to the resources of the container that you dragged the item to. The <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> is an object that can be used to navigate and display the data in the object that is returned by the service.

- Creates a data binding for a control. If you drag the item to an existing control in the designer, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] binds the control to the item. If you drag the item to a container, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] creates the control that was selected for the dragged item, and it binds the control to the item. The control is created inside a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.

### Objects
 When you drag an object or property from the **Data Sources** window to the designer, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that creates a data-bound control (or binds an existing control to the object or property). However, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] does not generate code to fill the object with data. You must write this code yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom classes must be public and, by default,  have a constructor without parameters. They can't be nested classes that have a "dot" in their syntax. For more information, see [XAML and Custom Classes for WPF](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e7313137-581e-4a64-8453-d44e15a6164a).

 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] generates [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] that does the following:

- Adds a new <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> to the resources of the container that you dragged the item to. The <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> is an object that can be used to navigate and display the data in the object.

- Creates a data binding for a control. If you drag the item to an existing control in the designer, the XAML binds the control to the item. If you drag the item to a container, the XAML creates the control that was selected for the dragged item, and it binds the control to the item. The control is created inside a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.
