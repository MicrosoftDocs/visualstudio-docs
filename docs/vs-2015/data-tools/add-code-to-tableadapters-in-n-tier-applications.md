# Add code to TableAdapters in n-tier applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can extend the functionality of a `TableAdapter` by creating a partial class file for the `TableAdapter` and adding code to it (instead of adding code to the *DatasetName*.DataSet.Designer file). Partial classes enable code for a specific class to be divided among multiple physical files. For more information, see [Partial](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7adaef80-f435-46e1-970a-269fff63b448) or [partial (Type)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/27320743-a22e-4c7b-b0b3-53afe3607334).  
  
 The code that defines a `TableAdapter` is generated every time changes are made to the `TableAdapter`. This code is also generated when changes are made during the running of any wizard that modifies the configuration of the `TableAdapter`. To prevent your code from being deleted during the regeneration of a `TableAdapter`, add code to the partial class file of the `TableAdapter`.  
  
 By default, after you separate the dataset and `TableAdapter` code, the result is a discrete class file in each project. The original project has a file named *DatasetName*.Designer.vb (or *DatasetName*.Designer.cs) that contains the `TableAdapter` code. The project that's designated in the **Dataset Project** property has a file named *DatasetName*.DataSet.Designer.vb (or *DatasetName*.DataSet.Designer.cs) that contains the dataset code.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> When you separate datasets and `TableAdapter`s (by setting the **DataSet Project** property), existing partial dataset classes in the project will not be moved automatically. Existing dataset partial classes must be moved manually to the dataset project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The DataSet Designer provides functionality for generating <xref:System.Data.DataTable.ColumnChanging> and <xref:System.Data.DataTable.RowChanging> event handlers when validation is needed. For more information, see [Add validation to an n-tier dataset](../data-tools/add-validation-to-an-n-tier-dataset.md).

### To add user code to a TableAdapter in an n-tier application  
  
1. Locate the project that contains the .xsd file (the dataset).  
  
2. Double click the **.xsd** file to open the dataset.  
  
3. Right-click the `TableAdapter` that you want to add code to, and then select**View Code**.  
  
     A partial class is created and opens in the Code Editor.  
  
4. Add code inside the partial class declaration.  
  
5. The following example shows where to add code to the `CustomersTableAdapter` in the `NorthwindDataSet`:  
  
    ```vb  
    Partial Public Class CustomersTableAdapter  
        ' Add code here to add functionality   
        ' to the CustomersTableAdapter.  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    public partial class CustomersTableAdapter  
    {  
        // Add code here to add functionality  
        // to the CustomersTableAdapter.  
    }  
    ```
