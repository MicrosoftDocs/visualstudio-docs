# Directly access the database with a TableAdapter
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In addition to the `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand`, TableAdapters are created with methods that can be run directly against the database. These methods (`TableAdapter.Insert`, `TableAdapter.Update`, and `TableAdapter.Delete`) can be called to manipulate data directly in the database.  
  
 If you don't want to create these direct methods, set the TableAdapter's `GenerateDbDirectMethods` property to `false` in the **Properties** window. If any queries  are added to a TableAdapter in addition to the TableAdapter's main query, they are standalone queries that don't generate these DbDirect methods.  
  
## Sendcommandsdirectly to a database  
 Call the TableAdapter DbDirect method that performs the task you are trying to accomplish.  
  
#### To insert new records directly into a database  
  
- Call the TableAdapter's `Insert` method, passing in the values for each column as parameters. The following procedure uses the `Region` table in the Northwind databaseas an example.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have an instance available, instantiate the TableAdapter that you want to use.

#### To update records directly in a database  
  
- Call the TableAdapter's `Update` method, passing in the new and original values for each column as parameters.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have an instance available, instantiate the TableAdapter that you want to use.

#### To delete records directly from a database  
  
- Call the TableAdapter's `Delete` method, passing in the values for each column as parameters of the `Delete` method. The following procedure uses the `Region` table in the Northwind databaseas an example.
