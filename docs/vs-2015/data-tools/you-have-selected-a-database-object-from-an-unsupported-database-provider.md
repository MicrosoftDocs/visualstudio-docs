# You have selected a database object from an unsupported database provider
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)]) supports only the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server (<xref:System.Data.SqlClient>). Although you can click **OK** and continue to work with objects from unsupported database providers, you may experience unexpected behavior at run time.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Only data connections that use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server are supported.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Click **OK** to continue designing the entity classes that map to the connection that uses the unsupported database provider. You might experience unexpected behavior when you use unsupported database providers.  
  
     -or-  
  
- Click **Cancel**.  
  
     The action is stopped. Create or use a data connection that uses the .NET Framework Provider for SQL Server.
