# Extend the functionality of a TableAdapter
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can extend the functionality of a TableAdapter by adding code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.  
  
 The code that defines a TableAdapter is regenerated when any changes are made to the TableAdapter in the **Dataset Designer**, or when a wizard  modifies the configuration of a TableAdapter. To prevent your code from being deleted during the regeneration of a TableAdapter, add code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.  
  
 Partial classes allow code for a specific class to be divided among multiple physical files. For more information, see [Partial](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7adaef80-f435-46e1-970a-269fff63b448) or [partial (Type)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/27320743-a22e-4c7b-b0b3-53afe3607334).  
  
## Locate TableAdapters in code  
 While TableAdapters are designed with the **Dataset Designer**, the TableAdapter classes that are generated are not  nested classes of <xref:System.Data.DataSet>. TableAdapters are located in a namespace based on the name of the TableAdapter's associated dataset. For example, if your application contains a dataset named `HRDataSet`, the TableAdapters would be located in the `HRDataSetTableAdapters` namespace. (The naming convention follows this pattern: *DatasetName* + `TableAdapters`).  
  
 The following example assumes a TableAdapter named `CustomersTableAdapter`is in a project with `NorthwindDataSet`.  
  
#### To create a partial class for a TableAdapter  
  
1. Add a new class to your project by going to the **Project** menu and selecting**Add Class**.  
  
2. Name the class `CustomersTableAdapterExtended`.  
  
3. Select **Add**.  
  
4. Replace the code with the correct namespace and partial class name for your project as follows:  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataTableAdapters/CS/CustomersTableAdapterExtended.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataTableAdapters/VB/CustomersTableAdapterExtended.vb#2)]
