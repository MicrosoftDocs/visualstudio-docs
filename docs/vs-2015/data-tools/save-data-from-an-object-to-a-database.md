# Save data from an object to a database
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can save data in objects to a database by passing the values from your object to one of the TableAdapter's DBDirect methods (for example, `TableAdapter.Insert`).
  
 To save data from a collection of objects, loop through the collection of objects (for example, a for-next loop), and send the values for each object to the database by using one of the TableAdapter's DBDirect methods.  
  
 By default, DBDirect methods are created on a TableAdapter that can be run directly against the database. These methods can be called directly and don't require <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable> objects to reconcile changes in order to send updates to a database.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> When you're configuring a TableAdapter, the main query must provide enough information  for the DBDirect methods to be created. For example, if a TableAdapter is configured to query data from a table that does not have a primary key column defined, it does not generate DBDirect methods.  
  
|TableAdapter DBDirect method|Description|  
|----------------------------------|-----------------|  
|`TableAdapter.Insert`|Adds new records to a database and enables you to pass in individual column values as method parameters.|  
|`TableAdapter.Update`|Updates existing records in a database. The `Update` method takes original and new column values as method parameters. The original values are used to locate the original record, and the new values are used to update that record.<br /><br /> The `TableAdapter.Update` method is also used to reconcile changes in a dataset back to the database by taking a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, <xref:System.Data.DataRow>, or an array of <xref:System.Data.DataRow>s as method parameters.|  
|`TableAdapter.Delete`|Deletes existing records from the database based on the original column values passed in as method parameters.|  
  
### To save new records from an object to a database  
  
- Create the records by passing the values to the `TableAdapter.Insert` method.  
  
     The following example creates a new customer record in the `Customers` table by passing the values in the `currentCustomer` object to the `TableAdapter.Insert` method.

### To update existing records from an object to a database  
  
- Modify the records by calling the `TableAdapter.Update` method, passing in the new values to update the record, and passing in the original values to locate the record.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Your object needs to maintain the original values in order to pass them to the `Update` method. This example uses properties with an `orig` prefix to store the original values.  
  
     The following example updates an existing record in the `Customers` table by passing the new and original values in the `Customer` object to the `TableAdapter.Update` method.

     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#24](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form3.vb#24)]  
  
### To delete existing records from a database  
  
- Delete the records by calling the `TableAdapter.Delete` method and passing in the original values to locate the record.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Your object needs to maintain the original values in order to pass them to the `Delete` method. This example uses properties with an `orig` prefix to store the original values.  
  
     The following example deletes a record from the `Customers` table by passing the original values in the `Customer` object to the `TableAdapter.Delete` method.

## .NET Framework Security  
 You must have permission to perform the selected INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on the table in the database.
