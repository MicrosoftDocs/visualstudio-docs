# Filter and sort data in a Windows Forms application
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You filter data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to a string expression that returns the desired records.  
  
 You sort data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property to the column name you want to sort on; append `DESC` to sort in descending order, or append `ASC` to sort in ascending order.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If your application does not use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components, you can filter and sort data by using <xref:System.Data.DataView> objects. For more information, see [DataViews](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0fe5dfa2-c1cd-435f-90b6-b4dd2e3ef34b).  
  
## To filter data by using a BindingSource component  
  
- Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to the expression you want to return. For example, the following code returns customers with a `CompanyName` that starts with "B":
