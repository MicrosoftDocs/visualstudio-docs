# Save data in a transaction
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This walkthrough demonstrates how to save data in a transaction by using the <xref:System.Transactions> namespace. This example uses the `Customers` and `Orders` tables from the Northwind sample database.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 This walkthrough requires access to the Northwind sample database.
  
## Create a Windows application  
 The first step is to create a **Windows Application**.  
  
#### To create the new Windows project  
  
1. In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, create a new **Project**.  
  
2. Name the project **SavingDataInATransactionWalkthrough**.  
  
3. Select **Windows Application**, and then select **OK**. For more information, see [Client Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2dfb50b7-5af2-4e12-9bbb-c5ade0e39a68).  
  
     The **SavingDataInATransactionWalkthrough** project is created and added to **Solution Explorer**.  
  
## Create a database data source  
 This step uses the [Data Source Configuration Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c4df7de5-5da0-4064-940c-761dd6d9e28f) to create a data source based on the `Customers` and `Orders` tables in the Northwind sample database.  
  
#### To create the data source  
  
1. On the **Data** menu, select**Show Data Sources**.  
  
2. In the **Data Sources** window, select **Add New Data Source** to start the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**.  
  
3. On the **Choose a Data Source Type**screen, select **Database**, and then select **Next**.  
  
4. On the **Choose your Data Connection**screen do one of the following:  
  
    - If a data connection to the Northwind sample database is available in the drop-down list, select it.  
  
         -or-  
  
    - Select **New Connection** to launch the **Add/Modify Connection** dialog box and create a connection to the Northwind database.  
  
5. If your database requires a password, select the option to include sensitive data, and then select **Next**.  
  
6. On the **Save connection string to the Application Configuration file** screen, select **Next**.  
  
7. On the **Choose your Database Objects** screen, expand the **Tables** node.  
  
8. Select the `Customers` and `Orders` tables, and then select **Finish**.  
  
     The **NorthwindDataSet** is added to your project and the `Customers` and `Orders` tables appear in the **Data Sources** window.  
  
## Addcontrols to the form  
 You can create the data-bound controls by dragging items from the **Data Sources** window onto your form.  
  
#### To create data bound controls on the Windows form  
  
- In the **Data Sources** window, expand the **Customers** node.  
  
- Drag the main **Customers** node from the **Data Sources** window onto **Form1**.  
  
     A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and a tool strip (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>) for navigating records appear on the form. A [NorthwindDataSet](../data-tools/dataset-tools-in-visual-studio.md), CustomersTableAdapter, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> appear in the component tray.  
  
- Drag the related **Orders** node (not the main **Orders** node, but the related child-table node below the **Fax** column) onto the form below the **CustomersDataGridView**.  
  
     A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> appears on the form. An OrdersTableAdapter and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> appear in the component tray.  
  
## Add a reference to the System.Transactions assembly  
 Transactions use the <xref:System.Transactions> namespace. A project reference to the System.Transactions assembly is not added by default, so you need to manually add it.  
  
#### To add a reference to the System.Transactions DLL file  
  
1. On the **Project** menu, select**Add Reference**.  
  
2. Select **System.Transactions**(on the **.NET** tab), and then select **OK**.  
  
     A reference to **System.Transactions** is added to the project.  
  
## Modifythe code in the BindingNavigator's SaveItem button  
 For the first table dropped onto your form, code is added by default to the `click` event of the save button on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>. You need to manually add code to update any additional tables. For this walkthrough, we refactor the existing save code out of the save button's click event handler.We also create a few more methods to provide specific update functionality based on whether the row needs to be added or deleted.  
  
#### To modify the auto-generated save code  
  
1. Select the **Save** button on the **CustomersBindingNavigator** (the button with the floppy disk icon).  
  
2. Replace the `CustomersBindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click` method with the following code:  
  
    [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#4](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/CS/Form2.cs#4)]
    [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#4](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form2.vb#4)]  
  
   The order for reconciling changes to related data is as follows:  
  
- Delete child records. (In this case, delete records from the `Orders` table.)  
  
- Delete parent records. (In this case, delete records from the `Customers` table.)  
  
- Insert parent records.(In this case, insert records in the `Customers` table.)  
  
- Insert child records. (In this case, insert records in the `Orders` table.)  
  
#### To delete existing orders  
  
- Add the following `DeleteOrders` method to **Form1**:  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#5](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/CS/Form2.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#5](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form2.vb#5)]  
  
#### To delete existing customers  
  
- Add the following `DeleteCustomers` method to **Form1**:  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#6](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/CS/Form2.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#6](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form2.vb#6)]  
  
#### To add new customers  
  
- Add the following `AddNewCustomers` method to **Form1**:  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#7](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/CS/Form2.cs#7)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#7](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form2.vb#7)]  
  
#### To add new orders  
  
- Add the following `AddNewOrders` method to **Form1**:  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#8](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/CS/Form2.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#8](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataSaving/VB/Form2.vb#8)]
