# How to: Connect to Data in a Service
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You connect your application to the data returned from a service by running the [Data Source Configuration Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c4df7de5-5da0-4064-940c-761dd6d9e28f) and selecting **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page.  
  
 Upon completion of the wizard, a service reference is added to your project and is immediately available in the [Data Sources Window](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0d20f699-cc95-45b3-8ecb-c7edf1f67992).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The items that appear in the **Data Sources** window are dependent on the information that the service returns. Some services might not provide enough information for the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** to create bindable objects. For example, if the service returns an untyped dataset, then no items appear in the **Data Sources Window** upon completing the wizard. This is because untyped datasets do not provide schema, so the wizard does not have enough information to create the data source.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
### To connect your application to a service  
  
1. On the **Data** menu, click **Add New Data Source**.  
  
2. Select **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, and then click **Next**.  
  
3. Enter the address of the service you want to use, or click **Discover** to locate services in the current solution, and then click **Go**.  
  
4. Optionally, a new **Namespace** can be typed in place of the default value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Click **Advanced** to open the [Configure Service Reference Dialog Box](../data-tools/configure-service-reference-dialog-box.md).  
  
5. Click **OK** to add a service reference to your project.  
  
6. Click **Finish**.  
  
     The data source is added to the **Data Sources** window.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
#### To add functionality to your application  
  
- Select an item in the **Data Sources** window and drag it onto a form to create bound controls. For more information, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).
