# Bind Windows Forms controls to data in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can display data to users of your application by binding data to Windows Forms. To create these data-bound controls, you can drag items from the **Data Sources** window onto the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio. This topic describes some of the most common tasks, tools, and classes involved in creating data-bound Windows Forms applications.

 For general information about how to create data-bound controls in Visual Studio, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md). For more information about data binding in Windows Forms, see [Windows Forms Data Binding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c3826d8e-ea25-4ad4-a669-45bfb19192aa).

## BindingSource component
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component serves two purposes. First, it provides a layer of abstraction when binding the controls on your form to data. Controls on the form are bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component (instead of being bound directly to a data source).

 Second, it can manage a collection of objects. Adding a type to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> creates a list of that type.

 For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, see:

- [BindingSource Component](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3e2faf4c-f5b8-4fa6-9fbc-f59c37ec2fb9)

## BindingNavigator control
 This component provides a user interface for navigating through data displayed by a Windows application. For more information, see [BindingNavigator Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/18c1e2a5-9834-40d3-9b2e-2b545e4e769e).

## DataGridView control
 To display and edit tabular data from many different kinds of data sources, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. You can bind data to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataSource%2A> property. For more information, see [DataGridView Control Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0a45c661-89dc-4390-9cc6-c47eee501488).
