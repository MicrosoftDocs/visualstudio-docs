# Save data by using a transaction
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You save data in a transaction by using the <xref:System.Transactions> namespace. Use the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object to participate in a transaction that is automatically managed for you.  
  
 Projects are not created with a reference to the System.Transactions assembly, so you need to manually add a reference to projects that use transactions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Transactions> namespace is supported in Windows 2000 or later.  
  
 The easiest way to implement a transaction is to instantiate a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object in a `using` statement. (For more information, see [Using Statement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/665d1580-dd54-4e96-a9a9-6be2a68948f1), and [using Statement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/afc355e6-f0b9-4240-94dd-0d93f17d9fc3).) The code that runs within the `using` statement participates in the transaction.  
  
 To commit the transaction, call the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope.Complete%2A> method as the last statement in the using block.  
  
 To roll back the transaction, throw an exception prior to calling the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope.Complete%2A> method.  
  
 For more information, see [Save data in a transaction](../data-tools/save-data-in-a-transaction.md).  
  
### To add a reference to the System.Transactions dll  
  
1. On the **Project** menu, select **Add Reference**.  
  
2. On the **.NET** tab (**SQL Server** tab for SQL Server projects), select **System.Transactions**, and then select **OK**.  
  
     A reference to System.Transactions.dll is added to the project.  
  
### To save data in a transaction  
  
- Add code to save data within the using statement that contains the transaction. The following code shows how to create and instantiate a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object in a using statement:
