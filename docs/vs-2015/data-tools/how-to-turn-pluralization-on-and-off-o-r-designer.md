# How to: Turn pluralization on and off (O/R Designer)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

By default, when you drag database objects that have names ending in s or ies from **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** onto the [LINQ to SQL Tools in Visual Studio](../data-tools/linq-to-sql-tools-in-visual-studio2.md), the names of the generated entity classes are changed from plural to singular. This is done to more accurately represent the fact that the instantiated entity class maps to a single record of data. For example, adding a Customers table to the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] results in an entity class named Customer because the class will hold data for only a single customer.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Pluralization is on by default only in the English-language version of Visual Studio.

### To turn pluralization on and off  
  
1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2. In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Database Tools**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Select **Show all settings** if the **Database Tools** node is not visible.  
  
1. Click **O/R Designer**.  
  
2. Set **Pluralization of names** to **Enabled** = **False** to set the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] so that it does not change class names.  
  
3. Set **Pluralization of names** to **Enabled** = **True** to apply pluralization rules to the class names of objects added to the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)].
