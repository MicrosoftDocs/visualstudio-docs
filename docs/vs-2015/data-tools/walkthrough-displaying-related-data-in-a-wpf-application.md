# Walkthrough: Displaying Related Data in a WPF Application
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In this walkthrough, you will create a WPF application that displays data from database tables that have a parent/child relationship. The data is encapsulated in entities in an Entity Data Model. The parent entity contains overview information for a set of orders. Each property of this entity is bound to a different control in the application. The child entity contains details for each order. This set of data is bound to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control.  
  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  
  
- Creating a WPF application and an Entity Data Model that is generated from data in the AdventureWorksLT sample database.  
  
- Creating a set of data-bound controls that display overview information for a set of orders. You create the controls by dragging a parent entity from the **Data Sources** window to **the WPF Designer**.  
  
- Creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control that displays related details for each selected order. You create the controls by dragging a child entity from the **Data Sources** window to a window in **the WPF designer**.  
  
   [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
- Access to a running instance of SQL Server or SQL Server Express that has the AdventureWorksLT sample database attached to it. You can download the AdventureWorksLT database from the [CodePlex Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=87843).  
  
  Prior knowledge of the following concepts is also helpful, but not required to complete the walkthrough:  
  
- Entity Data Models and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. For more information, see [Entity Framework Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a2166b3d-d8ba-4a0a-8552-6ba1e3eaaee0).  
  
- Working with the WPF Designer. For more information, see [WPF and Silverlight Designer Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/570b7a5c-0c86-4326-a371-c9b63378fc62).  
  
- WPF data binding. For more information, see [Data Binding Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c707c95f-7811-401d-956e-2fffd019a211).  
  
## Creating the Project  
 Create a new WPF project to display the order records.  
  
#### To create a new WPF project  
  
1. Start Visual Studio.  
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
3. Expand **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, and then select **Windows**.  
  
4. Make sure that **.NET Framework 4** is selected in the combo box at the top of the dialog box. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control that you use in this walkthrough is available only in the .NET Framework 4.  
  
5. Select the **WPF Application** project template.  
  
6. In the **Name** box, type `AdventureWorksOrdersViewer`.  
  
7. Click **OK**.  
  
     Visual Studio creates the `AdventureWorksOrdersViewer` project.  
  
## Creating an Entity Data Model for the Application  
 Before you can create data-bound controls, you must define a data model for your application and add it to the **Data Sources** window. In this walkthrough, the data model is an Entity Data Model.  
  
#### To create an Entity Data Model  
  
1. On the **Data** menu, click **Add New Data Source** to open the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**.  
  
2. On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, click **Database**, and then click **Next**.  
  
3. On the **Choose a Database Model** page, click **Entity Data Model**, and then click **Next**.  
  
4. On the **Choose Model Contents** page, click **Generate from database**, and then click **Next**.  
  
5. On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page, do one of the following:  
  
   - If a data connection to the AdventureWorksLT sample database is available in the drop-down list, select it.  
  
      -or-  
  
   - Click **New Connection** and create a connection to the AdventureWorksLT database.  
  
     Make sure that the **Save entity connection settings in App.Config as** option is selected, and then click **Next**.  
  
6. On the **Choose Your Database Objects** page, expand **Tables**, and then select the following tables:  
  
   - **SalesOrderDetail**  
  
   - **SalesOrderHeader**  
  
7. Click **Finish**.  
  
8. Build the project.  
  
## Creating Data-Bound Controls that Display the Orders  
 Create controls that display order records by dragging the `SalesOrderHeaders` entity from the **Data Sources** window to the WPF designer.  
  
#### To create data-bound controls that display the order records  
  
1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click MainWindow.xaml.  
  
    The window opens in the WPF designer.  
  
2. Edit the XAML so the **Height** and **Width** properties are set to 800  
  
3. In the **Data Sources** window, click the drop-down menu for the **SalesOrderHeaders** node and select **Details**.  
  
4. Expand the **SalesOrderHeaders** node.  
  
5. Click the drop-down menu next to **SalesOrderID** and select **ComboBox**.  
  
6. For each of the following child nodes of the **SalesOrderHeaders** node, click the drop-down menu next the node and select **None**:  
  
   - **RevisionNumber**  
  
   - **OnlineOrderFlag**  
  
   - **ShipToAddressID**  
  
   - **BillToAddressID**  
  
   - **CreditCardApprovalCode**  
  
   - **SubTotal**  
  
   - **TaxAmt**  
  
   - **Freight**  
  
   - **rowguid**  
  
   - **ModifiedDate**  
  
     This action prevents Visual Studio from creating data-bound controls for these nodes in the next step. For this walkthrough, it is assumed that the end user does not need to see this data.  
  
7. From the **Data Sources** window, drag the **SalesOrderHeaders** node to the window in **the WPF Designer**.  
  
    Visual Studio generates XAML that creates a set of controls that are bound to data in the **SalesOrderHeaders** entity, and code that loads the data. For more information about the generated XAML and code, see [Bind WPF controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio1.md).  
  
8. In the designer, click the combo box next to the **Sales Order ID** label.  
  
9. In the **Properties** window, select the check box next to the **IsReadOnly** property.  
  
## Creating a DataGrid that Displays the Order Details  
 Create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control that displays order details by dragging the `SalesOrderDetails` entity from the **Data Sources** window to the WPF designer.  
  
#### To create a DataGrid that displays the order details  
  
1. In the **Data Sources** window, locate the **SalesOrderDetails** node that is a child of the **SalesOrderHeaders** node.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > There is also a **SalesOrderDetails** node that is a peer of the **SalesOrderHeaders** node. Make sure that you select the child node of the **SalesOrderHeaders** node.  
  
2. Expand the child **SalesOrderDetails** node.  
  
3. For each of the following child nodes of the **SalesOrderDetails** node, click the drop-down menu next the node and select **None**:  
  
   - **SalesOrderID**  
  
   - **SalesOrderDetailID**  
  
   - **rowguid**  
  
   - **ModifiedDate**  
  
     This action prevents Visual Studio from including this data in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control you create in the next step. For this walkthrough, it is assumed that the end user does not need to see this data.  
  
4. From the **Data Sources** window, drag the child **SalesOrderDetails** node to the window in **the WPF Designer**.  
  
    Visual Studio generates XAML to define a new data-bound <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control, and the control appears in the designer. Visual Studio also updates the generated `GetSalesOrderHeadersQuery` method in the code-behind file to include the data in the **SalesOrderDetails** entity.  
  
## Testing the Application  
 Build and run the application to verify that it displays the order records.  
  
#### To test the application  
  
1. Press **F5**.  
  
     The application builds and runs. Verify the following:  
  
    - The **Sales Order ID** combo box displays **71774**. This is the first order ID in the entity.  
  
    - For each order you select in the **Sales Order ID** combo box, detailed order information is displayed in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>.  
  
2. Close the application.  
  
## Next Steps  
 After completing this walkthrough, learn how to use the **Data Sources** window in Visual Studio to bind WPF controls to other types of data sources. For more information, see [Bind WPF controls to a WCF data service](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-a-wcf-data-service.md) and [Bind WPF controls to a dataset](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-a-dataset.md).
