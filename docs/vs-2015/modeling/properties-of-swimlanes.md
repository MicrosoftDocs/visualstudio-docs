# Properties of Swimlanes
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can add swimlanes to a diagram. Swimlanes divide a diagram into vertical or horizontal areas. You can define other shapes to be displayed inside swimlanes. For more information, see [How to Define a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/how-to-define-a-domain-specific-language.md). For more information about how to use these properties, see [Customizing and Extending a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/customizing-and-extending-a-domain-specific-language.md).  
  
 Swimlanes have the properties that are listed in the following table.  
  
|Property|Description|Default|

|Text Color|The color that is used for text decorators that are associated with this swimlane.|Black|  
|Access Modifier|The level of access of the class (`public` or `internal`).|Public|  
|Custom Attributes|Used to add attributes to the code class that is generated from this swimlane.|\<none>|  
|Generates Double Derived|If `True`, both a base class and a partial class (to support customization through overrides) will be generated. For more information, see [Overriding and Extending the Generated Classes](../modeling/overriding-and-extending-the-generated-classes.md).|False|  
|Has Custom Constructor|If `True`, a custom constructor will be provided in the source code. For more information, see [Overriding and Extending the Generated Classes](../modeling/overriding-and-extending-the-generated-classes.md).|False|  
|Inheritance Modifier|Describes the kind of inheritance of the source code class that is generated from the swimlane (`none`, `abstract` or `sealed`).|none|

|Name|The name of this swimlane.|Current name|  
|Namespace|The namespace that is affiliated with this swimlane.|Current namespace|  
|Tooltip Type|How the tooltip is defined (`fixed`, `variable`, or `none`). If `fixed`, then the value of the `Fixed Tooltip Text` property is used; if `variable`, then the tooltip is defined in custom code.|\<none>|

|Alignment|Horizontal or vertical alignment.|Vertical|  
|Initial Height|The initial height of this swimlane, in inches. Applicable only to horizontal swimlanes.|0|  
|Initial Width|The initial width of this swimlane, in inches. Applicable only to vertical swimlanes.|0|  
|Exposes Text Color|If `True`, the user can set the color of a swimlane in the generated designer. To set this, right-click the swimlane shape and click **Add Exposed**.|False|  
|Description|Used to document the generated designer.|\<none>|
