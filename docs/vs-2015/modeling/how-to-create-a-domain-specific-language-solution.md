# How to: Create a Domain-Specific Language Solution
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A domain-specific language (DSL) is created by using a specialized [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] solution.

## Prerequisites
 Before you can start this procedure, you must first install these components:

|[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]|[https://www.visualstudio.com/](https://www.visualstudio.com/)|
|[!INCLUDE[vssdk_current_short](../includes/vssdk-current-short-md.md)]|[Visual Studio SDK](../extensibility/visual-studio-sdk.md)|

## Creating a Domain-Specific Language Solution

#### To create a domain-specific language solution

1. Start the DSL Wizard.

   1. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.

   2. The **New Project** dialog box appears.

   3. Under **Project types**, expand the **Other Project Types** node, and click **Extensibility**.

   4. Click **Domain-Specific Language Designer**.

   5. In the **Name** box, type a name for the solution. Click **OK**.

       The **Domain-Specific Language Designer Wizard** appears.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Preferably, the name that you type should be a valid Visual C# identifier, because it might be used to generate code.

      ![Create DSL dialog](../modeling/media/create-dsldialog.png "Create_DSLDialog")

2. Choose a DSL template.

    On the **Select Domain-Specific Language Options** page, select one of the solution templates such as **Minimal Language**. Choose a template that is similar to the DSL that you want to create.

    For more information about solution templates, see [Choosing a Domain-Specific Language Solution Template](../modeling/choosing-a-domain-specific-language-solution-template.md).

3. Enter a filename extension on the **File Extension** page. It should be unique in your computer, and in any computers on which you want to install the DSL. You should see the message **No applications or Visual Studio editors use this extension**.

   - If you have used the file name extension in previous experimental DSLs that have not been fully installed, you can clear them out by using the **Reset the Experimental Instance** tool, which can be found in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] SDK menu.

   - If another [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Extension that uses this file extension has been fully installed on your computer, consider uninstalling it. On the **Tools** menu, click **Extension Manager**.

4. Inspect, and if necessary adjust, the fields in the remaining pages of the wizard. When you are satisfied with the settings, click **Finish**. For more information about the settings, see [DSL Designer Wizard Pages](#settings).

    The wizard creates a solution that has two projects, which are named **Dsl** and **DslPackage**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you see a message that alerts you not to run text templates from untrusted sources, click **OK**. You can set this message not to appear again.

## <a name="settings"></a> The DSL Designer Wizard Pages
 You can leave several of the fields unchanged from their default values. However, make sure that you set the File Extension field.

### Solution Settings page
 **Which Template would you like to base your domain specific language on?**
 Choose a template that is similar to the DSL that you want to create. The different templates provide convenient starting points. When you select a solution template, the wizard displays a description. For more information about solution templates, see [Choosing a Domain-Specific Language Solution Template](../modeling/choosing-a-domain-specific-language-solution-template.md).

 **What do you want to name your domain-specific language?**
 Defaults to the solution name. Code is generated from this value. It must be valid as a C# class name.

### File Extension page
 **What extension should model files use?**
 Type a new file extension.

 Verify that this file extension has not already been registered for use in this computer, as follows:

 Look under **Other tools and applications registered to handle this extension**. If you see the message **No applications or Visual Studio editors use this extension**, then you can use this file extension.

 If you see a list of tools or packages, you should do one of the following:

- Type a different file extension.

     \- or -

- Reset the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Experimental Instance. This will unregister all of the DSLs that you have previously built. On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**, **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK**, **Tools**, and then **Reset the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Experimental instance**. You can rebuild any other DSLs that you want to use again.

     \- or -

- If a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Extension that uses this file extension has been fully installed on your computer, uninstall it. On the **Tools** menu, click **Extension Manager**.

### Product Settings page
 **What is the name of the product that the new domain-specific language belongs to?**
 Defaults to the DSL name.

 This value is used in Windows Explorer (or File Explorer) to describe files that have this file extension.

 **What is the name of the company that the product belongs to?**
 Your company name.

 This value is incorporated into the AssemblyInfo properties of your DSL package.

 **What is the root namespace for projects in this solution?**
 This defaults to a name composed from your company and product names.

### Signing page
 **Create a strong name key file**
 The default option is to create a new key to sign your DSL assembly.

 **Use existing strong name key**
 Use this option if you want to integrate your DSL with another assembly.

 For more information about strong naming, see [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](/dotnet/standard/assembly/create-use-strong-named).
