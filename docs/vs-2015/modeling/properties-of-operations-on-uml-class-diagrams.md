# Properties of operations on UML class diagrams
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

On a UML class diagram, you can add *operations* to classes and interfaces. An operation is a method or function that can be performed by an instance of a class or interface.  

 To add an operation, right-click the class or interface, point to **Add**, and then click **Operation**.  

 If the operations of a class on the diagram are not visible, click the expand chevron at the top of the class or interface. If you can see the **Operation** header, click **[+]** to expand the operations section.  

## Signature of an Operation  
 The signature of an operation is the line of text that represents it in a class or interface on a UML class diagram. It has the following form:  

 \+ OperationName (parameter1 : Type1 [*], ...) : ReturnType [\*]  

 \+ denotes public Visibility. The other permitted values are - (private), # (protected), ~ (package).  

 `OperationName` is underlined if the **Is Static** property is true, and is italic if the **Is Abstract** property is true.  

 `: ReturnType` is omitted if no return type is defined.  

 `[*]` denotes the multiplicity of a parameter or return type. It is omitted if the multiplicity is 1.  

 See the next section for a full description of these properties.  

## Properties  
 These are the properties of an operation in a class or interface on a UML class diagram.  

 To see the properties of an operation, right-click the operation in the class or interface on the diagram, and then click **Properties**. The properties appear in the **Properties** window.  

|      Property       |   Default    |                                                                                                                                                                                 Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If you enter a name for a new type in this property, a type will be added to the **Unspecified Types** section of UML Model Explorer.      |
|   **Return Type**   |    (none)    |                                                                               **(none)**, or a primitive type, or a type that is defined in the model. If you enter a name for a new type in this property, a type will be added to the **Unspecified Types** section of UML Model Explorer.                                                                                |
| **Postconditions**  |    (none)    |                                                                                                                         An optional condition specifying a relationship between the state of the system before and after the operation's execution.                                                                                                                         |

|   **Visibility**    |    Public    |                  The permitted values, and the characters that appear in the signature are:<br /><br /> **+ Public** - visible globally<br /><br /> **- Private** - not visible outside the owning type<br /><br /> **# Protected** - visible to types derived from the owner<br /><br /> **~ Package** - visible to other types within the same package.                   |
|    **Signature**    |  +*Name*()   |                                                                                      Summarizes the visibility, name, parameters, and return type of this operation. You can change these properties by editing the signature on the diagram, or by editing the individual properties.                                                                                      |

Read-only.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Link model elements and work items](../modeling/link-model-elements-and-work-items.md).                                                                                                  |
|   **Concurrency**   |  Sequential  | **Sequential** - The operation is or will be designed without concurrency control. Calling this operation concurrently might result in failures.<br /><br /> **Guarded** - The operation will automatically block until other instances of it have completed.<br /><br /> **Concurrent** - The operation is designed so that multiple calls to it can execute concurrently. |
|    **Is Static**    |    False     |                                                                                                  If true, this operation is shared between all instances of this type.<br /><br /> If true, the name of the operation will be underlined where it appears on the diagram.                                                                                                   |

Therefore, the owning class is abstract.                                                                                                                                         |

Therefore, it can be used, for example, in a test to check the state of the system.                                                                                                  |

|   **Is Ordered**    |    False     |                                                                                                                                             If true, the collection forms a sequential list. For **Multiplicity** more than 1.                                                                                                                                              |

For **Multiplicity** more than 1.                                                                                                                                         |
