# Properties of Decorators
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Decorators are icons, text, or expand/collapse chevrons that can appear on shapes or connectors on the diagram. The following tables show the properties for the three kinds of decorator. Some of the properties appear only on shape decorators or only on connector decorators.  
  
 For more information, see [How to Define a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/how-to-define-a-domain-specific-language.md). For more information about how to use these properties, see [Customizing and Extending a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/customizing-and-extending-a-domain-specific-language.md).
