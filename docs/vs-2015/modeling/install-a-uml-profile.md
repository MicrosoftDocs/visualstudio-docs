# Install a UML profile
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can extend Visual Studio with a UML profile. A profile lets you add stereotypes and additional properties to the elements you can create in UML models. To see which versions of Visual Studio support this feature, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
 If you receive a UML model that has been created using profiles, some properties will not be displayed unless you install the same profiles.  
  
 A profile is distributed inside a Visual Studio Extension. An extension might also contain other features such as menu commands. For more information, see [Managing Visual Studio Extensions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160728).  
  
### To install a UML Profile on your computer  
  
1. The profile should have been given to you in the form of a Visual Studio Extension (`.vsix`) file. There might be other features in the same file.  
  
     Move the `.vsix` file to a convenient location on your computer.  
  
2. Double-click the `.vsix` file in Windows Explorer (or File Explorer), or open it within [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  
  
3. Click **Install** in the dialog box that appears.  
  
4. To uninstall or temporarily disable the extension, open **Extension Manager** from the **Tools** menu.  
  
### To uninstall or disable a profile extension  
  
1. On the Visual Studio **Tools** menu, click **Extension Manager**.  
  
2. Click the extension that you want to remove, and then click **Disable** or **Uninstall**.
