# Multiple DSLs in One Solution
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can package several DSLs as part of a single solution so that they are installed together.  
  
 You can use several techniques to integrate multiple DSLs. For more information, see [Integrating Models by using Visual Studio Modelbus](../modeling/integrating-models-by-using-visual-studio-modelbus.md) and [How to: Add a Drag-and-Drop Handler](../modeling/how-to-add-a-drag-and-drop-handler.md) and [Customizing Copy Behavior](../modeling/customizing-copy-behavior.md).  
  
### To build more than one DSL in the same solution  
  
1. Create two or more DSL solutions and a VSIX project, and add all the projects to a single solution.  
  
   - To create a new VSIX project: In the **New Project** dialog, select **Visual C#**, **Extensibility**, **VSIX Project**.  
  
   - Create two or more DSL solutions in the VSIX solution directory.  
  
        For each DSL, open a new instance of Visual Studio. Create the new DSL, and specify the same solution folder as the VSIX solution.  
  
        Make sure that you create each DSL with a different filename extension.  
  
   - Change the names of the **Dsl** and **DslPackage** projects so that they are all different. For example: `Dsl1`, `DslPackage1`, `Dsl2`, `DslPackage2`.  
  
   - In each **DslPackage\*\source.extension.tt**, update this line to the correct Dsl project name:  
  
        `string dslProjectName = "Dsl2";`  
  
   - In the VSIX solution, add the Dsl* and DslPackage\* projects.  
  
        You might want to place each pair in its own solution folder.  
  
2. Combine the VSIX manifests of the DSLs:  
  
   1. Open _YourVsixProject_**\source.extension.manifest**.  
  
   2. For each DSL, choose **Add Content** and add:  
  
       - `Dsl*` project as a **MEF Component**  
  
       - `DslPackage*` project as a **MEF Component**  
  
       - `DslPackage*` project as a **VS Package**  
  
3. Build the solution.  
  
   The resulting VSIX will install both DSLs. You can test them by using F5, or deploy _YourVsixProject_**\bin\Debug\\\*.vsix**.
