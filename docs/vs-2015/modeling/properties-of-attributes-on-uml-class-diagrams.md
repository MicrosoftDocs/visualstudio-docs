# Properties of attributes on UML class diagrams
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

On a UML class diagram, you can add *attributes* to classes and interfaces. An attribute defines values that can be attached to instances of the class or interface.  

 To add an attribute, right-click the class or interface, point to **Add**, and then click **Attribute**.  

 If the attributes of a class on the diagram are not visible, click the chevron at the top of the class or interface to expand it. If you can see the **Attributes** header, click **[+]** to expand the attributes section.  

## Signature of an Attribute  
 An attribute's signature is the line that represents it in a class or interface on a UML class diagram. It has this form:  

```  
+ AttributeName : TypeName [*]  
```  

 \+ denotes public Visibility. The other permitted values are - (private), # (protected), ~ (package).  

 `AttributeName` is underlined if the attribute is static.  

 `: TypeName` is omitted if the attribute has no type.  

 `[*]` denotes the multiplicity. It is omitted if the multiplicity is 1.  

## Properties  
 The following table describes the properties of an attribute in a class or interface on a UML class diagram.  

 To see the properties of an attribute, right-click the attribute in the class or interface on the diagram, and then click **Properties**. The properties appear in the Properties window.  

 To view the properties of an attribute, right-click it and then click **Properties**.  

|   **Property**    | **Default**  |                                                                                                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You cannot use non-primitive types such as **Decimal** because the value must be encoded in the metadata. If you enter a name for a new type in this property, a type will be added to the **Unspecified Types** section of UML Model Explorer.                                                 |
