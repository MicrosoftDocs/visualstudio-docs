# Link UML model updates by using transactions
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you define an extension to the UML designers in Visual Studio, you can group several changes into a single transaction called a *linked undo context*. To see which versions of Visual Studio support UML models, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
 By default, each modification that your code makes to a model can be separately undone by the user. For example, if you define a menu command that swaps the names of two UML classes, a user could invoke the command, and then perform a single undo. This would undo the change to one name, but not the other, leaving your model in an unintended state.  
  
 To avoid this, your code can perform a series of changes within a transaction. This makes the changes look like a single change to the user. A subsequent undo command will undo the whole series.  
  
 An additional benefit is that your code can undo a partially-complete set of changes by throwing an exception or by aborting the transaction.  
  
## To group changes into a single transaction  
 Ensure your project References include this .NET assembly:  
  
 **Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.Sdk.[version].dll**  
  
 Inside your class, declare an imported property that has type <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.ExtensionEnablement.ILinkedUndoContext>:  
  
 `using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.ExtensionEnablement;`  
  
 `...`  
  
 `class … {`  
  
 `[Import]`  
  
 `public ILinkedUndoContext LinkedUndoContext { get; set; }`  
  
 In a method that modifies the model, enclose your changes in a transaction:  
  
 `using (ILinkedUndoTransaction transaction =`  
  
 `LinkedUndoContext.BeginTransaction("my updates"))`  
  
 `{`  
  
 `// code to update model elements or shapes goes here`  
  
 `transaction.Commit();`  
  
 `}`  
  
 Notice the following:  
  
- You must always include `Commit()` at the end of the transaction. If a transaction is disposed without being committed, the transaction will be rolled back. That is, the model will be restored to its state at the start of the transaction.  
  
- If an exception occurs that is not caught inside the transaction, the transaction will be rolled back. It is a frequent pattern to enclose the `using` block of the transaction inside a `try…catch` block.  
  
- You can nest transactions.  
  
- You can provide any non-blank name to `BeginTransaction()`.  
  
- Only the UML Model Store is affected by these transactions. Modeling transactions do not affect: variables, external stores such as files and databases, layer diagrams, and code models.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.ExtensionEnablement;  
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.Interfaces;  
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.Classes;  
    using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.Extensions;  
    using System.Linq;  
    using System.ComponentModel.Composition;  
 ...  
  [Import]  
  public ILinkedUndoContext LinkedUndoContext { get; set; }  
  
  /// <summary>  
  /// Swap the names of the currently selected elements.  
  /// </summary>  
  public void Execute(IMenuCommand command)  
  {  
    var selectedShapes =  
      Context.CurrentDiagram.GetSelectedShapes<IClassifier>();  
    if (selectedShapes.Count() < 2) return;  
    IClassifier firstElement = selectedShapes.First().Element;  
    IClassifier lastElement = selectedShapes.Last().Element;  
    string firstName = firstElement.Name;  
    // Perform changes inside a transaction so that undo  
    // works as a single change.  
    using (ILinkedUndoTransaction transaction =   
      LinkedUndoContext.BeginTransaction("Swap names"))  
    {  
        firstElement.Name = lastElement.Name;  
        lastElement.Name = firstName;  
        transaction.Commit();  
    }  
 }  
```
