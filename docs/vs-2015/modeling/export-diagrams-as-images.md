# Export diagrams as images
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In Visual Studio, you can save modeling diagrams in read-only formats so that you can share them with stakeholders, users, or project team members who do not use the same version of Visual Studio.

 To see which versions of Visual Studio support this feature, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/what-s-new-for-design-in-visual-studio.md#VersionSupport).

### To copy a diagram or part of a diagram to another application

1. On the diagram, select some or all the shapes.

2. Right-click your selection, and then click **Copy**.

3. Paste your selection into the application that you want.

### To export an image as part of an automated process

- See [Export UML diagrams to image files](../modeling/export-uml-diagrams-to-image-files.md).

### To save a modeling diagram as an XML Paper Specification (.xps) file

1. On the **File** menu, click **Print** to open the **Print** dialog box.

2. In the **Name** list, select **Microsoft XPS Document Writer**, and then click **OK**.

3. In the **Save the file as** dialog box, save the file as an **XPS Document (\*.xps)** file.
