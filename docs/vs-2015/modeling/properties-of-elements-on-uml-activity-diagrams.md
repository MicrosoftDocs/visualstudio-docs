# Properties of elements on UML activity diagrams
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

On a UML activity diagram, each element on the diagram has properties. To see the properties of an element, right-click the element on the diagram or in **UML Model Explorer** and then click **Properties**. The properties appear in the **Properties** window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This topic is about the properties of elements on UML activity diagrams. For information about how to read UML activity diagrams, see [UML Activity Diagrams: Reference](../modeling/uml-activity-diagrams-reference.md). For more information about how to draw UML activity diagrams, see [UML Activity Diagrams: Guidelines](../modeling/uml-activity-diagrams-guidelines.md).
