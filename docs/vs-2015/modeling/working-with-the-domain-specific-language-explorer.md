# Working with the Domain-Specific Language Explorer
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The **DSL Explorer** displays several kinds of information in a tree view. For more information about most of the items in the DSL Explorer, see [How to Define a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/how-to-define-a-domain-specific-language.md).  
  
 It has the following nodes:  
  
- **Connection Builders**. A list of the connection builders in the model. For more information about connection builders, see [Customizing Link Creation - redirection](../misc/customizing-link-creation-redirection.md).  
  
- **Connectors**. A list of the connector diagram elements in the model. For more information about connectors, see [Types of Shapes and Connectors - redirect](../misc/types-of-shapes-and-connectors-redirect.md).  
  
- **Diagram**. A set of properties that define the diagram, and lists of connector maps and shape maps.  
  
- **Domain Classes**. A list of the domain classes in the model.  
  
- **Domain Relationships**. A list of the domain relationships in the model.  
  
- **Domain Types**. A list of the built-in and external types that are used in the model.  
  
- **Editor**. A list of **Toolbox** tabs and the items they contain, and validation settings for the model. For more information about validation, see [Validation in a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/validation-in-a-domain-specific-language.md).  
  
- **Explorer Behavior**. Settings that specify the behavior of the explorer in the generated designer. For more information about how to customize the explorer, see [Customizing the Model Explorer](../modeling/customizing-the-model-explorer.md).  
  
- **Shapes**. A list of the shape diagram elements in the model.  
  
- **Xml Serialization Behavior**. Serialization settings for the model. For more information about serialization, see [Customizing File Storage and XML Serialization](../modeling/customizing-file-storage-and-xml-serialization.md).
