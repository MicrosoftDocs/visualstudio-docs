# How to: Add a New Item to a Workflow Project (Legacy)
After you have created a workflow project using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provided by [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] that targets either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)], you can add [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] items and other familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] items to your project.  
  
 The following table lists the [!INCLUDE[wf2](../includes/wf2-md.md)] items that you can add to a workflow project.  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|Activity|An activity with the activity definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Activity (with code separation)|An activity definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Sequential Workflow (code)|A sequential workflow with the workflow definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|Sequential Workflow (with code separation)|A sequential workflow with the workflow definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
|State Machine Workflow (code)|A state machine workflow with the workflow definition in a designer code file and user code in a separate code file.|  
|State Machine Workflow (with code separation)|A state machine workflow with the workflow definition expressed as workflow markup and user code in a separate code file.|  
  
### To add a new item to a workflow project
