# How to: Create an Activity Library
Custom activities are used to model your particular business processes in a workflow. The Activity Library template in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] has been provided to enable you to create such custom activities visually using the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)].  
  
### To create a Workflow Activity Library  
  
1. Start [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project…**.  
  
     The **New Project** dialog box opens.  
  
3. In the **Project Types** pane, select **Workflow** from either the **Visual C#** projects or **Visual Basic** groupings depending on your language preference.  
  
4. In the **Templates** pane, select **Activity Library**.  
  
5. In the **Name** box, type in a descriptive name for your project to make it easy to identify.  
  
6. In the **Location** box, type in the directory in which you want to save your project or click **Browse** to navigate to it.  
  
7. In the **Solution** box, type in a descriptive name for your solution, then click **OK**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to add a workflow console application to an existing solution, open that solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)], right click the solution in **Solution Explorer**, and select **Add**, then **New Project…** to open the **New Project** dialog box. Proceed as described above in this procedure.  
  
8. The project template creates an activity definition in XAML. [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] opens and displays the canvas for your custom activity.  
  
9. Drag an activity from the **Toolbox** to the design surface to include it in your custom activity.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    > You are allowed only one child activity in the body of your custom activity; however, that child activity could be a composite activity, such as a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity or <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity.
