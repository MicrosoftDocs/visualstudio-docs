# How to: Create an Empty Workflow Project (Legacy)
Follow these steps to create an Empty Workflow Project using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provided by [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].

### To create an empty workflow project

1. Start Visual Studio.

2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project**.

     The **New Project** dialog box opens.

3. Select either the **.NET Framework 3.0** option or the **.NET Framework 3.5** option in the drop down list at the top of the **New Project** window to access the legacy designer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The default option in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] is **.NET Framework 4**. This option is used to create [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] applications that target the [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] and it does not use the legacy designer.

4. In the **Project Types** pane, select Visual C# or Visual Basic (under **Other Languages**), and then select **Workflow**.

5. In the **Templates** pane, select **Empty Workflow Project**.

6. In the **Name** box, enter a descriptive name for your project to make it easy to identify.

7. In the **Location** box, enter the directory in which you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to it.

     If you want a solution directory created for the project, select the **Create directory for solution** check box and enter a name in the **Solution Name** box.

8. Click **OK**.
