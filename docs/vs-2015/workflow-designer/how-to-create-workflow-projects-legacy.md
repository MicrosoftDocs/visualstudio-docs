# How to: Create Workflow Projects (Legacy)
Follow these steps to create a [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] project that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. This procedure uses the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provided by [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
### To create a workflow project  
  
1. Start [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project**.  
  
     The **New Project** dialog box opens.  
  
3. Select either the **.NET Framework 3.0** option or the **.NET Framework 3.5** option in the drop down list at the top of the **New Project** window to access the legacy designer.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The default option in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] is **.NET Framework 4**. This option is used to create [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] applications that target the [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] and it does not use the legacy designer.  
  
4. In the **Project Types** pane, select Visual C# projects or Visual Basic projects, and then select **Workflow**.  
  
5. In the **Templates** pane, select one of the installed project templates:  
  
    - Sequential Workflow Console Application  
  
    - Sequential Workflow Library  
  
    - Workflow Activity Library  
  
    - State Machine Workflow Console Application  
  
    - State Machine Workflow Library  
  
    - Empty Workflow Project  
  
6. In the **Name** box, enter a descriptive name for your project to make it easy to identify.  
  
7. In the **Location** box, enter the directory in which you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to the directory.  
  
     If you want a solution directory created for the project, select the **Create directory for solution** check box and enter a name in the **Solution Name** box.  
  
8. Click **OK**.
