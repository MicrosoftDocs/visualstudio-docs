# How to: Add Activities to the Toolbox
Activities can be added to the **Toolbox** in your solution in several different ways. You can add them from within your current project, reference them from a different project, or reference them from a different assembly.  
  
### To add an activity from within your current project  
  
1. Add a new custom activity to your current workflow project. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../includes/crabout-md.md)] adding a new custom activity to your project, see [How to: Add a New Item to a Workflow Project](../workflow-designer/how-to-add-a-new-item-to-a-workflow-project.md).  
  
2. Add custom logic to your activity.  
  
3. Build the project. If the build was successful, a new category in the **Toolbox** named "\<*project name*>" with the custom activity included in that category is displayed.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the toolbox is reset, custom activities will be removed, even if the solution is built again. To repopulate the toolbox with custom activities after it has been reset, restart [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The toolbox can only show one activity of a given name. If two activities from different assemblies have the same class name, only one will display.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The application domain is shared among editor instances; if static variables are used, they will be shared among editor instances as well. If this is not the desired behavior, a service should be used to track variable instances. See [Using the ModelItem Editing Context](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7f9f1ea5-0147-4079-8eca-be94f00d3aa1) for information on using services within the designer.  
  
### To add an activity from within a different project  
  
1. Open a solution that contains at least one workflow project and either a custom activity library project or another workflow project that defines a custom activity.  
  
2. Build both projects. If the builds were successful, a new category in the **Toolbox** named "\<*project name*>" with the custom activity included in that category is displayed.  
  
### To add an activity to the Toolbox from an assembly  
  
1. Open a workflow solution.  
  
2. From the **Tools** menu, select **Choose Toolbox Items…**.  
  
3. In the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box, select the **System.Activities Components** tab then click **Browse…** to navigate to the assembly that contains the custom activity you want to add.  
  
4. Select the assembly and click **OK**. The custom activity component is added to the list of components and is automatically selected.  
  
    1. Click **OK** to close the dialog.  
  
5. To display the toolbox, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu.  
  
6. The custom activity appears in the **Toolbox** under the category that was in focus before the item was added. For example, if the **General** category was selected in the **Toolbox** before adding the toolbox item, the activity appears under the **General** category.
