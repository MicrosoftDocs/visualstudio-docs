# Debugging Workflows with the Workflow Designer
The [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provides the ability to debug workflows and custom activities. The process and behavior are similar to that of the default [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] debugger. The topics in this section describe how to perform traditional debugging procedures as well as debugging XAML and expressions.
