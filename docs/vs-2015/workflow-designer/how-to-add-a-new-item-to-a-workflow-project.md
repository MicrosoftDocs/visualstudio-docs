# How to: Add a New Item to a Workflow Project
After you have created a workflow project, you can add workflow activities, designers, and other familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] items to your project.  
  
 The following table lists the [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] items that you can add to a workflow project.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|Activity|An activity to be composed of other activities. Selecting this item adds the same XAML file to the project as you would obtain when selecting the **Activity Library** template for a new project. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../includes/crabout-md.md)] on this procedure, see [How to: Create an Activity Library](../workflow-designer/how-to-create-an-activity-library.md).|  
|Activity Designer|A designer to customize the design-time experience of an activity. Selecting this item adds the same files to the project as you would obtain when selecting the **Activity Designer Library** template for a new project. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../includes/crabout-md.md)] on this procedure, see [How to: Create an Activity Designer Library](../workflow-designer/how-to-create-an-activity-designer-library.md).|  
|Code Activity|An activity with execution logic written in code. A source code file with an override of the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity.Execute%2A> method is already generated for you.|  
|WCF Workflow Service|A [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service built using workflow activities. Selecting this item adds the same files to the project as you would obtain when selecting the **WCF Workflow Service Application** template for a new project. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../includes/crabout-md.md)] on this procedure, see [How to: Create a WCF Workflow Service Application](../workflow-designer/how-to-create-a-wcf-workflow-service-application.md).|
