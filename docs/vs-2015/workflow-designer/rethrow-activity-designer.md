# Rethrow Activity Designer
The **Rethrow** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Rethrow> activity.  
  
## The Rethrow Activity  
 The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Rethrow> activity throws a previously thrown exception. This activity can only be used in a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Catch> handler in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity.  
  
### Using the ReThrow Activity Designer  
 The **Rethrow** activity designer can be found in the **Error Handling** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab on the left side of the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] (Alternatively, select **Toolbar** from the **View** menu or CTRL+ALT+X.)  
  
 The **Rethrow** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] surface wherever activities are usually placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. This creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Rethrow> activity with a default **DisplayName** of Throw. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value can be edited in the header of the **Rethrow** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.  
  
### The Rethrow Properties  
 The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Rethrow> properties and describes how they are used in the designer.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A>|False|Specifies the optional friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Rethrow> activity. The default is Rethrow.|
