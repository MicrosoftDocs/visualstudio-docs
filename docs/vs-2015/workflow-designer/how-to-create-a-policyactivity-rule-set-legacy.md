# How to: Create a PolicyActivity Rule Set (Legacy)
This topic describes how to create a policy activity rule set using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].  
  
 After you have dragged a **Policy** activity item from the **Toolbox** to the workflow design surface, you will want to select an existing rule or create a new rule set for the [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019) activity. You select an existing rule set by using the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box-legacy.md) and you create rule sets by using the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box-legacy.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can open the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box-legacy.md) dialog box directly by double-clicking on a [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019) activity that is on the workflow design surface.  
  
### To select or create a rule set for a PolicyActivity activity  
  
1. Right-click the [PolicyActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65019), and then click **Properties** to open the **Properties** window.  
  
2. Click the **RuleSetReference** property.  
  
3. Do one of the following:  
  
    - Click the **RuleSetReference** ellipses **[…]**, and then select an existing rule set in the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box-legacy.md). Then go to step 10.  
  
         -or-  
  
    - Type a name for a rule set. Click the **RuleSetReference** ellipses **[…]**, and then select **Edit** in the [Select Rule Set Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-rule-set-dialog-box-legacy.md).  
  
         -or-  
  
    - Type a name for a rule set. Expand the **RuleSetReference** property and select the ellipses **[…]** in the **RuleSet Definition** property.  
  
         The [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box-legacy.md) opens.  
  
4. In the [Rule Set Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/rule-set-editor-dialog-box-legacy.md), click **Add Rule** to add a new rule to the rule set.  
  
5. Enter the **Name**, **Priority**, and **Reevaluation** properties, or keep the default values.  
  
6. Enter the text for the **Condition**.  
  
7. Enter the text for the **Then Actions** and the **Else Actions**.  
  
8. Click **Add Rule** again to add another rule.  
  
9. When you are finished, click **OK**.
