# Activity Views (Legacy)
Many of the activities provided by [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)], from which workflows are composed, have several design views available in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. When you drag an activity designer from the **Toolbox** onto the design surface, and thereafter whenever you select the activity, you can switch between the different design views by using either the **Workflow** menu or by right-clicking the selected activity. Also, when you move the pointer over the name of a selected activity, a drop-down set of tabs appears that you can use to switch between the different views.  
  
 Every activity has at least one view; this is the default view shown when you drag an activity designer from the **Toolbox** onto the design surface. This activity default view is available as the **View [activity type]** option on the menus and tab, for example, **View Parallel**. Most of the activities have additional views and different activities can have different views. For example, the [TransactionScopeActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65093) activity has the compensation view and the [EventHandlingScopeActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65030) activity has an events view. Many of the activities that come with Windows Workflow Foundation have **View Cancel Handler** and **View Faults** design views to view the [CancellationHandlerActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65050) and a [FaultHandlersActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65055) associated with them.  
  
 The following table lists the name and description of each view.  
  
|Menu/Tab Option|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|**View [activity type]**|Select this menu or tab option to view the default graphical representation of the selected activity.|  
|**View Cancel Handler**|Select this menu or tab option view to view the [CancellationHandlerActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65050) associated with the selected activity.|  
|**View Fault Handler**|Select this menu or tab option view to view the [FaultHandlersActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65055) associated with the selected activity.|  
|**View Compensation Handler**|Select this menu or tab option view to view the [CompensationHandlerActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65053) associated with the selected [TransactionScopeActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65093).|  
|**View Events Handler**|Select this menu or tab option view to view the [EventHandlersActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65018) associated with the selected the [EventHandlingScopeActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65030).|
