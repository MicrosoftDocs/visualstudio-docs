# How to: Add Activities to the Toolbox (Legacy)
When building a workflow solution with the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)], custom activities can be added to the workflow project and their designers placed in the **Toolbox** for easy access. You can also add activities directly to the **Toolbox** from a dynamic-link library (DLL).  
  
### To add an activity to the Toolbox from a DLL  
  
1. Right-click the Toolbox window surface under **Windows Workflow**, and then click **Choose Items**.  
  
2. In the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box, click the **System.Activities Components** tab, and then click **Browse** from the lower right-hand side of the window.  
  
3. Select the DLL from the file directory that contains the implementation of the custom activity to add to the **Toolbox**, and then click **Open**.  
  
4. Click **OK** to finish adding the activity to the Toolbox.
