# Rule Condition Editor Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Rule Condition Editor** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].  
  
 You create and modify declarative rule conditions by using the **Rule Condition Editor** dialog box. These rule conditions are exposed as properties on the following Windows Workflow Foundation out-of-box activities:  
  
- [ConditionedActivityGroup](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65017)  
  
- [IfElseBranchActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65034)  
  
- [ReplicatorActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65039)  
  
- [WhileActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65049)  
  
- [SequentialWorkflowActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65040)  
  
- [StateMachineWorkflowActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65045)  
  
  You access the **Rule Condition Editor** dialog box by using the [Select Condition Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/select-condition-dialog-box-legacy.md).  
  
  The following table describes the user interface (UI) elements of the **Rule Condition Editor** dialog box.  
  
|UI Element|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Condition:**|Enter the expression for the rule condition.|  
|**OK**|Click to save the rule condition.|  
  
## Entering Condition Expressions  
 Condition expressions are entered as text. You can type **this.** into the editor to reference fields, properties, and methods used in the workflow, using an IntelliSense-like menu. Or you can type a workflow member name directly. You can add logical operators to the condition, such as AND, OR, and NOT. You can also add predicates. A predicate is a binary operator and two operands. The binary operators supported are **==**, **>**, **\<**, **>=**, and **<=**. Supported operands are constant value, arithmetic function, and scoped public members.  
  
 You can specify the type for the comparison, and you can compare to **null** or an empty string. You can make nested calls to members on a variable that contains a complex type, for example, `this.Address.State == "WA"`.  
  
 The Rule Condition Editor supports the following operators:  
  
- Relational operators: ==, =, !=  
  
- Comparison operators: <, \<=, >, >=  
  
- Arithmetic operators: +, - , *, /, MOD  
  
- Logical operators: AND, &&, OR, &#124;&#124;, NOT, !  
  
- Bitwise operators: &, &#124;  
  
  Expression operator precedence follows C# operator precedence rules.  
  
  The Rule Condition Editor supports the following numeric expressions:  
  
  this.i == 1D (resolves to 1.0)  
  
  this.i == 1E1 (resolves to 10.0)  
  
  this.i == 1L (resolves as a long)  
  
  this.i == 1M (resolves as a decimal)  
  
  this.i == 1F (resolves as a single)  
  
  this.i == 1U (resolves as an unsigned int)  
  
  For more information about conditions, see [Using Conditions in Workflows](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65009).
