# TransactionScope Activity Designer
The **TransactionScope** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity.  
  
## The TransactionScope Activity  
 The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity executes the contained activity in a single transaction. The transaction commits when the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> activity and all other participants in the transaction have completed successfully.  
  
### Using the TransactionScope Activity Designer  
 The **TransactionScope** activity designer can be found in the **Transaction** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab of [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] (Alternatively, select **Toolbar** from the **View** menu or CTRL+ALT+X.)  
  
 The **TransactionScope** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] surface wherever activities are usually placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. This creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity with a default <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of TransactionScope. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value can be edited in the header of the **TransactionScope** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.  
  
### The TransactionScope Properties  
 The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> properties can be edited on [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] surface. But the other properties must be edited on the property grid.  
  
|Property Name|Required|Usage|  
|-------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A>|False|The optional friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity. The default is TransactionScope. Although the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use one.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A>|True|Specifies the activity to execute in a single transaction. To add the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> activity, drop an activity from the **Toolbox** into the **Body** box on the **TransactionScope** activity designer with hint text “Drop activity here”.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.IsolationLevel%2A>|True|Specifies the <xref:System.Transactions.IsolationLevel> for this <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope>.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Timeout%2A>|False|Specifies the interval of time (formatted as 00:00:00, which indicates hours:minutes:seconds) that the transaction has to complete. The default value is 1 minute (00:01:00).|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.AbortInstanceOnTransactionFailure?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True>|True|Specifies the value that indicates whether the workflow should be aborted if the transaction aborts.|
