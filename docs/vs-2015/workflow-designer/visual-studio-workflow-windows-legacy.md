# Visual Studio Workflow Windows (Legacy)
The legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] provided by [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] can be used to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. The legacy designer is a visual designer that you can use to create a workflow. You can drag activities from the **Toolbox** to the design surface and then configure them there. As a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] editor window, it occupies the main window area used by other [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] editor windows. The name of the workflow is displayed in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] window title bar.

 Most of the legacy designer windows should be familiar to the experienced [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] user. The following table describes the primary windows.

|Window|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|Legacy Workflow Design Surface|A visual designer surface that is used to create a workflow that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. It provides the ability to compose activities visually by drag activity designers from the **Toolbox** to the design surface.|
|Toolbox|Provides graphical representations of activities, which you can drag to the design surface.|
|Properties|Used to configure workflow activity properties.|
|Solution Explorer|Displays workflow projects in a hierarchical tree view and enables access to features that help manage the projects.|
|Debug windows|The standard Visual Studio debugging windows, such as the **Threads**, **Call Stack**, **Breakpoint**, **Locals Tool**, and **Watch Tool** windows.|
