# Legacy Designer for Windows Workflow Foundation UI Help
This section contains the context-sensitive Help topics for the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)]. Use the legacy designer when you need to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].

 You can access these topics from the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] user interface by pressing **F1** when a legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] dialog box is open.
