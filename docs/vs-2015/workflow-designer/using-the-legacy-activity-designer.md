# Using the Legacy Activity Designer
This topic describes how to use the activity designer in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. Use the legacy designer when targeting the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].  
  
 The Activity Designer enables you to create your own custom activities.  
  
## Creating a Custom Activity  
 Follow these steps to create a custom activity using the Activity Designer:  
  
1. On the **Project** menu, click **Add Activity**.  
  
2. Select the **Activity** or **Activity (with code separation)** template.  
  
   1. Use the **Activity** template to create an activity with the activity definition and the user code in same code file.  
  
   2. Use the **Activity (with code separation)** template to create an activity with the activity definition expressed as workflow markup and the user code in a separate code file.  
  
3. Type an activity name or keep the default name, and then click **Add**.  
  
   You can also create a set of custom activities by creating a new project of type **Workflow Activity Library**. For more information about this project type, see [How to: Create a Workflow Activity Library (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/how-to-create-a-workflow-activity-library-legacy.md).  
  
## Configuring an Activity  
 While the Activity Designer is active, you can use the property browser to configure the properties listed in the following table.  
  
|Property|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|**Name**|Name of the activity.|  
|**Base Class**|Base class that the activity derives from. The default base class is [SequenceActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65020). In the **Properties** window, click the **Base Class** ellipses **[â€¦]** to select another base class in the [Browse and Select a .NET Type Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/browse-and-select-a-dotnet-type-dialog-box-legacy.md).|  
|**Description**|User-defined description of the activity.|  
|**Enabled**|Set to **True** by default to enable activity execution and validation. Set to **False** to disable activity execution and validation. For information about activity execution and validation, see [Developing Workflow Activities](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65024).|  
  
## Adding Child Activities  
 You can drag child activities from the Toolbox to the activity that you are designing. You can then configure each child activity using the property browser.
