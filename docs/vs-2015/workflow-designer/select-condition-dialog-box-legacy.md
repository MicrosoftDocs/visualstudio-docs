# Select Condition Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Select Condition** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].

 The **Select Condition** dialog box is used to select a declarative rule condition to be assigned to an activity's condition property. These rule conditions are exposed as properties on the following Windows Workflow Foundation out-of-box activities:

- [ConditionedActivityGroup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65017)

- [IfElseBranchActivity](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65034)

- [ReplicatorActivity](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65039)

- [WhileActivity](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65049)

  For information about how to access the **Select Condition** dialog box, see [How to: Create a Declarative Rule Condition (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/how-to-create-a-declarative-rule-condition-legacy.md).
