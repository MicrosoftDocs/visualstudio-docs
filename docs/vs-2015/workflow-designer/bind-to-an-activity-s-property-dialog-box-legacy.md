# Bind to an Activity&#39;s Property Dialog Box (Legacy)
This topic describes how use the **Bind to an Activity's Property** dialog box in the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. Use the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] when you need to target either the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].  
  
 An instance type of dependency property can be bound to another activity's public property or event. For more information about activity binding, see [Using Dependency Properties](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65007).  
  
 You select a property to bind to using the **Bind to an Activity's Property** dialog box. You open this dialog box by clicking the ellipses **[â€¦]** at the end of the selected property's text box in the **Properties** window, or by clicking the blue exclamation mark icon that appears next to the property name in the property browser.  
  
 The following table describes the user interface (UI) elements of the **Bind to an Activity's Property** dialog box.  
  
|UI Element|Description|

|**Bind to an existing member**|Select a member that you want to bind to in the tree view pane. The pane below the tree view displays a message that indicates if the member is a valid type to bind to or not. Click **OK** to bind to the selected valid member.|  
|**Bind to a new member**|Create a new member field or property to bind to. Enter a **New Member Name**. Choose whether you want to create a dependency property or a public field by selecting **Create Field** or **Create Property**. Click **OK** to create the new member.|
