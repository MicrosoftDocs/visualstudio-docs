# Sequential Workflow Views (Legacy)
[!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] provides a legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] that can be used to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] provides a way to graphically create [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] applications using the familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] user interface. [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] applications are composed of workflow process steps called activities. To create a workflow, compose activities on the design surface by dragging their respective activity designers from **Toolbox** onto the design surface.  
  
 When you create a sequential workflow, which is a [SequentialWorkflowActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65040), three views of the workflow are available. These views are accessible from the **Workflow** menu and from the context menu on the design surface.  
  
 The following table lists the name and description of each view.  
  
|Menu/Tab Option|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|**View SequentialWorkflow**|Right-click the design surface and select the **View SequentialWorkflow** option from the context menu to display the **Sequential Workflow** view, which shows the activity-based graphical representation of the sequential workflow. Or select **View SequentialWorkflow** from the **Workflow** menu.|  
|**View Cancel Handler**|Right-click the design surface and select the **View Cancel Handler** option from the context menu to display the **Sequential Workflow** view, which shows the [CancellationHandlerActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65050) activity associated with the workflow. Or select **View Cancel Handler** from the **Workflow** menu.|  
|**View Fault Handler**|Right-click the design surface and select the **View Fault Handler** option from the context menu to display the **Faults** view, which shows the [FaultHandlersActivity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=65055) activity associated with the workflow. Or select **View Fault Handler** from the **Workflow** menu.|  
  
 For more information about similar views, see [Activity Views (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/activity-views-legacy.md).
