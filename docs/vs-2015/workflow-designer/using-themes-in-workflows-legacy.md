# Using Themes in Workflows (Legacy)
This topic describes how to use themes in [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] when using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] that targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)].

 You can customize the look of your workflows with the legacy designer by using [!INCLUDE[wf2](../includes/wf2-md.md)] themes. A theme defines the background and foreground colors, styles, icons, and other visual elements of a workflow. You can save themes for reuse by other workflows.

 You create and edit themes by using the [Theme Configuration Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/theme-configuration-dialog-box-legacy.md). To open this dialog box, select **Create New Theme** on the **Workflow** menu, or right-click the workflow design surface and select **Create New Theme**.

 You can select default and saved custom themes by using the [Themes, Workflow Designer, Options Dialog Box (Legacy)](../workflow-designer/themes-workflow-designer-options-dialog-box-legacy.md). To open this dialog box, click **Select Custom Theme** on the **Workflow** menu (or right-click the workflow design surface and click **Select Custom Theme**) and then select the **Workflow Designer** option. Select the theme you want and click **OK**.
