# Creating Legacy Workflow Projects
This section describes how to create workflow projects using the legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provided by vs2010. The legacy [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] targets the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. It includes information about how to use the workflow project templates that are listed in the following table.  
  
|Project Template|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|Sequential Workflow Console Application|A project for creating a sequential workflow console application.|  
|Sequential Workflow Library|A project for creating a sequential workflow library.|  
|Workflow Activity Library|A project for creating a library of activities, which can later be reused as building blocks in workflows.|  
|State Machine Workflow Console Application|A project for creating a state machine workflow console application.|  
|State Machine Workflow Library|A project for creating a state machine workflow library.|  
|Empty Workflow Project|An empty project for creating a workflow application.|
