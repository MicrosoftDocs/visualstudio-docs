# Receive Activity Designer
The **Receive** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity. A <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity is an activity that receives a message that can be either a built-in type such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message>, <xref:System.IO.Stream> or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, or an application-defined data contract, message contract, or XML class that can be serialized.

## The Receive Activity
 The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity can receive a single item or multiple items depending on the type of receive content used. A <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity can be bound to a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity that receives a message as part of a request/response message exchange pattern on the service.

### Using the Receive Activity Designer
 The **Receive** activity designer can be found in the **Messaging** category of the **Toolbox**, which is accessed by clicking the **Toolbox** tab on the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] (Alternatively, select **Toolbar** from the **View** menu or CTRL+ALT+X.)

 The **Receive** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] surface wherever activities are usually placed. This creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity with a default <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of Receive. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> can be edited in the header of the **Receive** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.

 To create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity and bind it to the selected <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity, right-click the **Receive** activity designer, click the **Create SendReply** item in the context menu and the **SendReplyToReceive** designer appears below the **Receive** designer. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity is an activity that sends the reply message as part of a request/response message exchange pattern on the service. It can be configured with the **SendReplyToReceive** designer.

 Alternatively, the **ReceiveAndSendReply** template designer in the **Messaging** category of the **Toolbox** can be used to create a pair of pre-configured <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../includes/crabout-md.md)] the use of the **ReceiveAndSendReply** and **SendReplyToReceive** template, see the [ReceiveAndSendReply](../workflow-designer/receiveandsendreply-template-designer.md) topic.

### The Receive Activity Properties
 The following table shows the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. These properties can be edited in properties grid or on the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] surface. The only required property is the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.OperationName%2A> property.

The default value is Receive.<br /><br /> Although the use of a non-default value for the friendly <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use such a value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This property is used to construct the default value for the **Action** property if the **Action** property is not explicitly set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This property is used to group service operations into individual service contracts. All <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activities that have the same <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.ServiceContractName%2A> are grouped into the same service contract (WSDL Port Type). The default value is the fully-qualified CLR name of the top level (root) activity.                                                                                                                                                                         |
