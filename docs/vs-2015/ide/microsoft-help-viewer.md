# Microsoft Help Viewer
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can install and view content for various products and technologies on your local computer by using Microsoft Help Viewer.

> [!WARNING]
> When you install Visual Studio, you get the Help Viewer. To start reading help topics in the Help Viewer rather than on the MSDN download site, go to the **Help** menu in Visual Studio, select **Set Help Preference**, and then select **Launch in Help Viewer**. The off-line help topics for a given version of Visual Studio are available only after the final release of that version.

 You can do the following:

- Find and download sets of content, which are also referred to as books.

- Browse and search the table of contents to find topics by title.

- Look up subjects in the index.

- Find information by using full-text search.

- View, bookmark, and print topics.

## Navigating the Help Viewer
 You can find information in installed content by using the navigation tabs, view installed content in the topic tab or tabs, and manage content by using the **Manage Content** tab. You can also perform additional tasks by using the buttons on the toolbar and find additional information in the lower-right corner of the window.

|||
|-|-|
|Navigation|By using the **Contents** tab, you can display installed content as a hierarchy and specify criteria to filter the titles that appear.<br /><br /> By using the **Search** tab, you can search for terms anywhere in the content, including code and topic titles.<br /><br /> By using the **Index** tab, you can search the index, specify criteria to filter the entries, and require that index entries either contain or start with text that you specify.<br /><br /> By using the **Favorites** tab, you can save links to topics that you use frequently, and you can display a list of topics that you've viewed recently.|
|Topic viewing|Each topic appears in a tab, and you can open multiple topics at the same time.|
|Managing content|You can install, update, move, and delete content by using the **Manage Content** tab. At the top of the tab, you can use the **Installation source** control to specify whether to install books from a network location or from a disk or URI. The **Local store path** box shows where books are installed on the local computer, and you can move them to a different location by choosing the **Move** button.<br /><br /> The content list shows which books you can install or have already installed, whether an update is available, and how large each book is. You can install or remove one or more books by choosing the appropriate **Add** or **Remove** links and then choosing the **Update** button under the **Pending changes** pane. If updates are available for any books that you've already installed, you can refresh that content by choosing the **Click here to download now** link at the bottom of the window. In addition, all installed books will be refreshed if updates are available when you install additional books. **Note:**  The functionality of the **Manage Content** tab may differ if the Help Viewer administrator deactivates these features, or if no internet access is available.|

 The toolbar in the Help Viewer window contains the following buttons:

- The **Show Topic in Contents** button shows the location of the topic in the **Contents** tab.

- The **Add to Favorites** button adds the active topic to the **Favorites** tab.

- The **Find in Topic** button highlights search text in the active topic.

- The **Print** button prints or shows a preview of the active topic.

- The **Viewer Options** button displays settings such as how large the text appears, how many search results to return, how many topics to show in history, and whether to check for updates online.

- The **Manage Content** button makes the **Manage Content** tab active.

- The small triangle opens a list of tabs, including topic tabs and the **Manage Content** tab. You can make any of those tabs active by choosing it.

  The lower area of the Help Viewer window contains information about the total size of pending downloads, the amount of disk space that they require, and the amount of disk space that's available. This area also contains information about errors that may have occurred and a link that you can choose to refresh installed content, if updates are available.
