# How to: Export Class Diagrams As Images (Class Designer)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To export a class diagram that you created from code in a project, save the diagram as an image. If you want to export UML class diagrams instead, see [Export diagrams as images](../modeling/export-diagrams-as-images.md).

1. Open your class diagram (.cd) file.

2. From the **Class Diagram** menu or the diagram surface shortcut menu, choose **Export Diagram as Image**.

3. Select a diagram.

4. Select the format that you want.

5. Choose **Export** to finish exporting.

     To automatically update exported images that are linked from other documents, export the diagram again in Visual Studio.
