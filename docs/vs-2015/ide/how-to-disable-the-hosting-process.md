# How to: Disable the Hosting Process
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Calls to certain APIs can be affected when the hosting process is enabled. In these cases, it is necessary to disable the hosting process to return the correct results.  
  
### To disable the hosting process  
  
1. Open an executable project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. Projects that do not produce executables (for example, class library or service projects) do not have this option.  
  
2. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
3. Click the **Debug** tab.  
  
4. Clear the **Enable the Visual Studio hosting process** check box.  
  
   When the hosting process is disabled, several debugging features are unavailable or experience decreased performance. For more information, see [Debugging and the Hosting Process](../debugger/debugging-and-the-hosting-process.md).  
  
   In general, when the hosting process is disabled:  
  
- The time needed to begin debugging [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] applications increases.  
  
- Design-time expression evaluation is unavailable.  
  
- Partial trust debugging is unavailable.
