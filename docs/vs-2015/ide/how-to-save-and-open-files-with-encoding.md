# How to: Save and Open Files with Encoding
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can save files with specific character encoding to support bi-directional languages. You can also specify an encoding when opening a file, so that Visual Studio displays the file correctly.  
  
### To save a file with encoding  
  
1. From the **File** menu, choose **Save File As**, and then click the drop-down button next to the **Save** button.  
  
     The **Advanced Save Options** dialog box is displayed.  
  
2. Under **Encoding**, select the encoding to use for the file.  
  
3. Optionally, under **Line endings**, select the format for end-of-line characters.  
  
     This option is useful if you intend to exchange the file with users of a different operating system.  
  
     If you want to work with a file that you know is encoded in a specific way, you can tell Visual Studio to use that encoding when opening the file. The method you use depends on whether the file is part of your project.  
  
### To open an encoded file that is part of a project  
  
1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the file and choose **Open With**.  
  
2. In the **Open With** dialog box, choose the editor to open the file with.  
  
     Many Visual Studio editors, such as the forms editor, will auto-detect the encoding and open the file appropriately. If you choose an editor that allows you to choose an encoding, the **Encoding** dialog box is displayed.  
  
3. In the **Encoding** dialog box, select the encoding that the editor should use.  
  
### To open an encoded file that is not part of a project  
  
1. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, choose **File** or **File From Web**, and then select the file to open.  
  
2. Click the drop-down button next to the **Open** button and choose **Open With**.  
  
3. Follow Steps 2 and 3 from the preceding procedure.
