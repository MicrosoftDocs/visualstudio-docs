# How to: Sign Application and Deployment Manifests
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

If you want to publish an application by using ClickOnce deployment, the application and deployment manifests must be signed with a public/private key pair and signed using Authenticode technology. You can sign the manifests by using a certificate from the Windows certificate store or a key file.  
  
 For more information about ClickOnce deployment, see [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](../deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment.md).  
  
 Signing the ClickOnce manifests is optional for .exe-based applications. For more information, see the "Generating Unsigned Manifests" section of this document.  
  
 For information about creating key files, see [How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/05026813-f3bd-4d7c-9e0b-fc588eb3d114).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] supports only Personal Information Exchange (PFX) key files that have the .pfx extension. However, you can select other types of certificates from the current user's Windows certificate store by clicking **Select from Store** on the **Signing** page of project properties.  
  
### To sign application and deployment manifests using a certificate  
  
1. Go to the project properties window (right-click the project node in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**, or type **project properties** in the **Quick Launch** window, or press ALT+ ENTER inside the **Solution Explorer** window). On the **Signing** tab, select the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box.  
  
2. Click the **Select from Store** button.  
  
     The **Select a Certificate** dialog box appears and displays the contents of the Windows certificate store.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    > If you click **Click here to view certificate properties**, the **Certificate Details** dialog box appears. This dialog box includes detailed information about the certificate, and includes additional options. You can click **certificates** to view additional Help information.  
  
3. Select the certificate that you want to use to sign the manifests.  
  
4. Additionally, you can specify the address of a timestamp server in the **Timestamp server URL** text box. This is a server that provides a timestamp specifying when the manifest was signed.  
  
### To sign application and deployment manifests using an existing key file  
  
1. On the **Signing** page, select the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box.  
  
2. Click the **Select from File** button.  
  
     The **Select File** dialog box appears.  
  
3. In the **Select File dialog** box, browse to the location of the key file (.pfx) that you want to use, and then click **Open**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > This option supports only files that have the .pfx extension. If you have a key file or certificate in another format, store it in the Windows certificate store and select the certificate is described in the previous procedure. The selected certificate's purpose should include code signing.  
  
     The **Enter password to open file** dialog box appears. (If the .pfx file is already stored in your Windows certificate store, or is not password protected, you will not be prompted to enter a password.)  
  
4. Enter the password to access the key file, and press ENTER.  
  
### To sign application and deployment manifests using a test certificate  
  
1. On the **Signing** page, select the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box.  
  
2. To create a new certificate for testing, click the **Create Test Certificate** button.  
  
3. In the **Create Test Certificate** dialog box, enter a password to help secure your test certificate.  
  
## Generating Unsigned Manifests  
 Signing the ClickOnce manifests is optional for .exe-based applications. The following procedures show how to generate unsigned ClickOnce manifests.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unsigned manifests can simplify development and testing of your application. However, unsigned manifests introduce substantial security risks in a production environment. Only consider using unsigned manifests if your ClickOnce application runs on computers within an intranet that is completely isolated from the internet or other sources of malicious code.  
  
 By default, ClickOnce automatically generates signed manifests unless one or more files are specifically excluded from the generated hash. In other words, publishing the application results in signed manifests if all files are included in the hash, even when the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box is cleared.  
  
#### To generate unsigned manifests and include all files in the generated hash  
  
1. To generate unsigned manifests that include all files in the hash, you must first publish the application together with signed manifests. Therefore, first sign the ClickOnce manifests by following one of the previous procedures, and then publish the application.  
  
2. On the **Signing** page, clear the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box.  
  
3. Reset the publish version so that only one version of your application is available. By default, Visual Studio automatically increments the revision number of the publish version every time that you publish an application. For more information, see [How to: Set the ClickOnce Publish Version](../deployment/how-to-set-the-clickonce-publish-version.md).  
  
4. Publish the application.  
  
#### To generate unsigned manifests and exclude one or more files from the generated hash  
  
1. On the **Signing** page, clear the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** check box.  
  
2. Open the **Application Files** dialog box and set the **Hash** to **Exclude** for the files that you want to exclude from the generated hash.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Excluding a file from the hash configures ClickOnce to disable automatic signing of the manifests, so you do not need to first publish with signed manifests as shown in the previous procedure.  
  
3. Publish the application.
