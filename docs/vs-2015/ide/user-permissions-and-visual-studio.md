# User Permissions and Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

For reasons of security you should run Visual Studio as a normal user whenever possible.

> [!WARNING]
> You should also make sure not to compile, launch, or debug any Visual Studio solution that does not come from a trusted person or a trusted location.

 You can do nearly everything in the Visual Studio IDE as a normal user, but, you need administrator permissions to complete the following tasks:

## Running Visual Studio as an Administrator
 You can launch Visual Studio with administrative permissions each time you start the IDE, or you can modify the application shortcut to always run with administrative permissions. For more information, see Windows Help.

#### To run Visual Studio with administrative permissions on [!INCLUDE[win8](../includes/win8-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win81](../includes/win81-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winserver8](../includes/winserver8-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../includes/winblue-server-2-md.md)]

1. On the **Start** screen, type **Visual Studio**. You should see the version or versions of Visual Studio you have installed.

2. Select the version of Visual Studio you want to start, and then bring up the shortcut menu (it appears at the bottom of the screen). Choose **Run as administrator**.

     When Visual Studio starts, **(Administrator)** appears after the product name in the title bar.

#### To run Visual Studio with administrative permissions on [!INCLUDE[win7](../includes/win7-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[winsvr08_r2](../includes/winsvr08-r2-md.md)]

1. On the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs**.

2. In the **Microsoft Visual Studio** *Version* folder select  **Visual Studio** *Version* open the shortcut menu, and then choose **Run as administrator**.

     When Visual Studio starts, **(Administrator)** appears after the product name in the title bar.
