# Visual C++ Typedefs in Class Designer
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Typedef statements create one or more layers of indirection between a name and its underlying type. The Class Designer supports C++ typedef types, which are declared with the keyword `typedef`, for example:  
  
```  
typedef class coord  
{  
   void P(x,y);  
   unsigned x;  
   unsigned y;  
} COORD;  
```  
  
 You can then use this type to declare an instance:  
  
 `COORD OriginPoint;`  
  
 Although you can declare a typedef without a name, Class Designer will not use the tag name that you specify; it will use the name that Class View generates. For example, the following declaration is valid, but it appears in Class View and Class Designer as an object named **__unnamed**:  
  
```  
typedef class coord  
{  
   void P(x,y);  
   unsigned x;  
   unsigned y;  
};  
```  
  
 For more information about using the `typedef` type, see [(NOTINBUILD)typedef Specifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/cc96cf26-ba93-4179-951e-695d1f5fdcf1).  
  
 A C++ typedef shape has the shape of the type specified in the typedef. For example, if the source declares `typedef class`, the shape has rounded corners and the label **Class**. For `typedef struct`, the shape has square corners and the label **Struct**.  
  
 Classes and structures can have nested typedefs declared within them; therefore, class and structure shapes can show nested typedef declarations as nested shapes.  
  
 Typedef shapes support the **Show as Association** and **Show as Collection Association** commands on the context menu.  
  
 The following are some examples of typdef types that the Class Designer supports:  
  
 `typedef type name`  
  
 *name* : *type*  
  
 typedef  
  
 Draws an association line connecting to type *name*, if possible.  
  
 `typedef void (*func)(int)`  
  
 `func: void (*)(int)`  
  
 typedef  
  
 Typedef for function pointers. No association line is drawn.  
  
 Class Designer does not display a typedef if its source type is a function pointer.  
  
```  
typedef int MyInt;  
class A {  
   MyInt I;  
};  
```  
  
 `MyInt: int`  
  
 typedef  
  
 `A`  
  
 Class  
  
 Draws an association line pointing from the source type shape to the target type shape.  
  
 `Class B {};`  
  
 `typedef B MyB;`  
  
 `B`  
  
 Class  
  
 `MyB : B`  
  
 typedef  
  
 Right-clicking a typedef shape and clicking **Show As Association** displays the typedef or class and an **Alias of** line joining the two shapes (similar to an association line).  
  
 `typedef B MyB;`  
  
 `typedef MyB A;`  
  
 `MyBar : Bar`  
  
 typedef  
  
 Same as above.  
  
```  
Class B {};  
typedef B MyB;  
  
class A {  
   MyB B;  
};  
```  
  
 `B`  
  
 Class  
  
 `MyB : B`  
  
 typedef  
  
 `A`  
  
 Class  
  
 `MyB` is a nested typedef shape.  
  
 `#include <vector>`  
  
 `...`  
  
 `using namespace std;`  
  
 `...`  
  
 `typedef vector<int> MyIntVect;`  
  
 `vector<T>`Class  
  
 `MyIntVect : vector<int>`  
  
 typedef  
  
 `class B {};`  
  
 `typedef B MyB;`  
  
 `class A : MyB {};`  
  
 `MyB : B`  
  
 typedef  
  
 -> B  
  
 `B`  
  
 `A`  
  
 Class  
  
 -> MyB  
  
 Class Designer does not support displaying this kind of relationship by using a context menu command.  
  
 `#include <vector>`  
  
 `Typedef MyIntVect std::vector<int>;`  
  
 `Class MyVect : MyIntVect {};`  
  
 `std::vector<T>`  
  
 Class  
  
 `MyIntVect : std::vector<int>`  
  
 typedef  
  
 `MyVect`  
  
 Class  
  
 -> MyIntVect
