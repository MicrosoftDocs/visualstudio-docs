# How to: Specify an Application Icon (Visual Basic, C#)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The `Icon` property for a project specifies the icon file (.ico) that will be displayed for the compiled application in File Explorer and in the Windows taskbar.  
  
 The `Icon` property can be accessed in the **Application** pane of the **Project Designer**; it contains a list of icons that have been added to a project either as resources or as content files.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> After you set the icon property for an application, you might also set the `Icon` property of each **Window** or **Form** in the application. For information about window icons for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) standalone applications, see <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A> property.  
  
### To specify an application icon  
  
1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose a project node (not the **Solution** node).  
  
2. On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Properties**.  
  
3. When the **Project Designer** appears, choose the **Application** tab.  
  
4. **(Visual Basic)** In the **Icon** list, choose an icon (.ico) file.  
  
     **C#** Near the **Icon** list, choose the **\<Browse...>** button, and then browse to the location of the icon file that you want.
