# Visual C++ Structures in Class Designer
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Class Designer supports C++ structures, which are declared with the keyword `struct`. Following is an example:  
  
```  
struct MyStructure  
{  
   char a;  
   int i;  
   long j;  
};  
```  
  
 For more information about using the `struct` type, see [struct](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3c6ba273-e248-4ff1-8c69-d2abcf1263c6).  
  
 A C++ structure shape in a class diagram looks and works like a class shape, except that the label reads **Struct** and it has square corners instead of rounded corners.
