# Adding and Removing Project Items
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can add or remove projects and project items by right-clicking on the project or solution node in **Solution Explorer**, and choosing **Add** or **Remove**. Removing a project from a solution, or an item from a project, does not delete it from disk or source control unless you select the option to delete it permanently.
