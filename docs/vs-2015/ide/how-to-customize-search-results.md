# How to: Customize Search Results
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can customize how search results appear in the **Search** tab in several ways.

## Change the number of topics that appear on a search results page
 You can specify the number of topics that appear on a single search results page.

#### To change the number of topics displayed at a time

1. On the **Toolbar**, choose **Viewer Options**.

     The **Viewer Options** dialog box appears.

2. In the **Maximum Search Results** list, choose 25, 50, 100, or 200.

## Search for content by language
 Documentation may include content in a language other than English. You can narrow your search results to content in a particular language. You can also include any content in English that matches your search query.

> [!WARNING]

#### To include English content alongside content in another language
