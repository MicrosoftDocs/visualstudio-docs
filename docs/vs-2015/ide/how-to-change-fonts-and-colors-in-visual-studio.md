# How to: Change Fonts and Colors in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can customize the color of the IDE frame and tool windows in Visual Studio in several ways.

> [!TIP]
> For information about how to change the colors of the code editor, see [How to: Change Fonts and Colors in the Editor](../ide/reference/how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-the-editor.md).

### Change the Color Theme of the IDE

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Options**.

2. In the options list, choose **Environment**, **General**.

3. In the **Color theme** list, choose either the default **Blue** theme, **Dark** or **Light**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a color theme, text in the IDE reverts to the default or previously customized fonts and sizes.
    >
    >  If you have Visual Studio Professional, Visual Studio Premium, or Visual Studio Ultimate, you can install additional predefined color themes and create your own by downloading and installing the [Visual Studio 2013 Color Theme Editor](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9e08e5d3-6eb4-4e73-a045-6ea2a5cbdabe).

### Use Windows High Contrast Colors

- Choose the Left Alt + Left Shift + Print Screen keys.

    > [!WARNING]
    > This option sets high contrast for all applications and UI on the current computer.

## Change IDE Fonts
 You can change the font and text size for all windows and dialog boxes in the IDE. You can choose to customize only certain windows and other text elements.

#### To change the font and size of all text in the IDE

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Options**.

2. In the options list, choose **Environment**, **Fonts and Colors**.

3. In the **Show settings for** list, choose **Environment Font**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to change the font for tool windows only, in the **Show settings for** list, choose **[All Text Tool Windows]**.

4. In the **Font** list, choose a font.

5. In the **Size** list, choose a text size, and then choose the **OK** button.
