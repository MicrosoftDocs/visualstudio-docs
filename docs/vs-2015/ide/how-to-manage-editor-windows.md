# How to: Manage Editor Windows
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can work on code in several locations at once. Do this by splitting an Editor window, or by opening several instances of editor windows.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Not all editor windows support multiple instances.  
  
## Splitting an editor window  
 An instance of an editor window can be split into two separate views for easier editing.  
  
#### To split a pane  
  
1. Click within the editor window to give it focus.  
  
2. From the **Window** menu, select **Split**.  
  
     The editing area divides into two panes separated by a splitter bar. You can scroll these panes independently to view and edit different parts of the active document at the same time. Any changes made in one pane are reflected in the other.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    > To make one pane larger than the other, drag the splitter bar upward or downward.  
  
#### To return to single-pane view  
  
- From the **Window** menu, select **Remove Split**.  
  
## Creating New Windows  
 You can also create multiple instances of an editor window. This feature allows you to open a lengthy document in more than one instance of an editor, so that you can view and edit different sections simultaneously in separate, full-sized editor windows.  
  
#### To create a new window  
  
- On the **Window** menu, click **New Window**.  
  
     A new tabbed instance of the editor is added.
