# How to: Exclude Projects from a Build
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can build a solution without building all projects that it contains. For example, you might exclude a project that breaks the build. You could then build the project after you investigate and address the issues.  
  
 You can exclude a project by taking the following approaches:  
  
- Removing it temporarily from the active solution configuration.  
  
- Creating a solution configuration that doesnâ€™t  include the project.  
  
  For more information, see [Understanding Build Configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md).  
  
### To temporarily remove a project from the active solution configuration  
  
1. On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Configuration Manager**.  
  
2. In the **Project contexts** table, locate the project you want to exclude from the build.  
  
3. In the **Build** column for the project, clear the check box.  
  
4. Choose the **Close** button, and then rebuild the solution.  
  
### To create a solution configuration that excludes a project  
  
1. On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Configuration Manager**.  
  
2. In the **Active solution configuration** list, choose **\<New>**.  
  
3. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the solution configuration.  
  
4. In the **Copy settings from** list, choose the solution configuration on which you want to base the new configuration (for example, **Debug**), and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
5. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, clear the check box in the **Build** column for the project that you want to exclude, and then choose the **Close** button.  
  
6. On the **Standard** toolbar, verify that the new solution configuration is the active configuration in the **Solution Configurations** box.  
  
7. On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Rebuild Solution**.
