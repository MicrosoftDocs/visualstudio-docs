# How to: Create and Remove Project Dependencies
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When building a solution that contains multiple projects, it can be necessary to build certain projects first, to generate code used by other projects. When a project consumes executable code generated by another project, the project that generates the code is referred to as a project dependency of the project that consumes the code. Such dependency relationships can be defined in the **Project Dependencies** Dialog Box.  
  
### To assign dependencies to projects  
  
1. In Solution Explorer, select a project.  
  
2. On the **Project** menu, choose **Project Dependencies**.  
  
    The **Project Dependencies** dialog box opens.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Project Dependencies** option is only available in a solution with more than one project.  
  
3. On the **Dependencies** tab, select a project from the **Project** drop-down menu.  
  
4. In the **Depends on** field, select the check box of any other project that must build before this project does.  
  
   Your solution must consist of more than one project before you can create project dependencies.  
  
### To remove dependencies from projects  
  
1. In Solution Explorer, select a project.  
  
2. On the **Project** menu, choose **Project Dependencies**.  
  
     The **Project Dependencies** dialog box opens.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Project Dependencies** option is only available in a solution with more than one project.  
  
3. On the **Dependencies** tab, select a project from the **Project** drop-down menu.  
  
4. In the **Depends on** field, clear the check boxes beside any other projects that are no longer dependencies of this project.
