# Accessibility Tips and Tricks
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] includes built-in accessibility features so you can easily work from the keyboard and use screen readers or other assistive technology devices. The topic includes some suggestions for optimizing [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] for accessibility as well as some useful shortcut key combinations.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).

## Save Your IDE Settings
 You can customize your IDE experience by saving your window layout, keyboard mapping scheme, and other preferences. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).

## Common Windows Shortcut Key Combinations
 You can use many of the standard Windows shortcut key combinations to perform tasks within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. Some of these shortcut key combinations include:
