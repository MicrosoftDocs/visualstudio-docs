# How to: Use the Keyboard Exclusively
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] provides many default shortcut key combinations to make it easy to navigate and code within the integrated development environment (IDE). For a full listing of shortcut keys used in Visual Studio, see [Default Keyboard Shortcuts](../../ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio.md). For information on keyboard shortcuts available for other Microsoft products, see [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/keyboard.aspx](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=40400).
