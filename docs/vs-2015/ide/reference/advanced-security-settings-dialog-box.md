# Advanced Security Settings Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This dialog box allows you to specify security settings related to debugging in zone.  
  
 To access this dialog box, select a project node in **Solution Explorer**, and then, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. When the **Project Designer** appears, click the **Security** tab. On the **Security** page, select **Enable ClickOnce Security Settings**, click **This is a partial trust application**, and then click **Advanced**.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Debug this application with the selected permission set**  
 If you select this check box, the permission set selected on the **Security** page is used during debugging. By default, this option is selected.  
  
 For debugging in a security zone to work, this option must be enabled; also, the **Enable the Visual Studio hosting process** option (available on the **Debug** page of the **Project Designer**) must be enabled.  
  
 For WPF Web Browser Application projects, the **Debug this application with the selected permission set** option is checked and disabled.  
  
 **Grant the application access to its site of origin**  
 If you select this check box, the application can access the Web site or server share on which it is published. By default, this option is selected.  
  
 **Debug this application as if it were downloaded from the following URL**  
 If you have to allow the application to access the Web site or server share corresponding to the **Installation URL** you specified on the **Publish** page, type that URL here. This option is available only when **Grant the application access to its site of origin** is selected.
