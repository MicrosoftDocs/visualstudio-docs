# /ResetSettings (devenv.exe)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Restores [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] default settings and automatically launches the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE. Optionally resets the settings to a specified .vssettings file.  
  
 The default settings are determined by the profile that was selected when [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] was first launched.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Devenv /ResetSettings SettingsFile  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `SettingsFile`  
 The full path and name of the .vssettings file to apply to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 To restore the General Development Settings profile, use `General`.  
  
## Remarks  
 If no `SettingsFile` is specified, you will be prompted to select a default collection of settings the next time you start [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## Example  
 The following command line applies the settings stored in the file `MySettings.vssettings`.  
  
```  
Devenv.exe /ResetSettings "C:\My Files\MySettings.vssettings"  
```
