## <a name="windows"></a> Accessibility Features of Windows  
 The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features are installed during Setup. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8431).  
  
### Free Step-by-Step Tutorials  
 Microsoft offers a series of step-by-step tutorials that provide detailed procedures for adjusting the accessibility options and settings on your computer. This information is presented in a side-by-side format so that you can learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both.  
  
 To find step-by-step tutorials for Microsoft products, see the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8431).  
  
### Assistive Technology Products for Windows  
 A wide variety of assistive technology products are available to make computers easier to use for people with disabilities. You can search a catalog of assistive technology products that run on Windows at the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8431).  
  
 If you use assistive technology, be sure to contact your assistive technology vendor before you upgrade your software or hardware to check for possible compatibility issues.
