# Open File Command
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Opens an existing file and allows you to specify an editor.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
File.OpenFile filename [/e:editorname]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `filename`  
 Required. The full or partial path and file name of the file to open. Paths containing spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks.  
  
## Switches  
 /e:`editorname`  
 Optional. Name of the editor in which the file will be opened. If the argument is specified but no editor name is supplied, the **Open With** dialog box appears.  
  
 The /e:`editorname` argument syntax uses the editor names as they appear in the Open With Dialog Box, enclosed in quotation marks.  
  
 For example, to open a file in the source code editor, you would enter the following for the /e:`editorname` argument.  
  
```  
/e:"Source Code (text) Editor"  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 As you enter a path, auto completion tries to locate the correct path and file name.  
  
## Example  
 This example opens the style file "Test1.css" in the source code editor.  
  
```  
>File.OpenFile "C:\My Projects\project1\Test1.css" /e:"Source Code (text) Editor"  
```
