# Task List, Environment, Options Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This Options page allows you to add, delete, and change the comment tokens that generate **Task List** reminders. To display these settings, select **Options** from the **Tools** menu, expand the **Environment** folder, and choose **Task List**.  
  
## Task List options  
 Confirm deletion of tasks  
 When selected, a message box is displayed whenever a User Task is deleted from the **Task List**, allowing you to confirm the deletion. This option is selected by default.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> To delete a Task Comment, use the link to find the comment, and then remove it from your code.  
  
 Show file names only  
 When selected, the **File** column of the **Task List** displays only the names of files to be edited, not their full paths.  
  
## Tokens  
 When you insert a comment into your code whose text begins with a token from the **Token List**, the **Task List** displays your comment as new entry whenever the file is opened for editing. You can click this **Task List** entry to jump directly to the comment line in your code. For more information, see [Using the Task List](../../ide/using-the-task-list.md).  
  
 Token List  
 Displays a list of tokens, and allows you to add or remove custom tokens. Comment tokens are case sensitive in Visual C# and Visual C++, but not in Visual Basic.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you do not type the desired token exactly as it appears in the **Token List**, a comment task will not be displayed in the **Task List**.  
  
 Priority  
 Sets the priority of tasks that use the selected token. Task comments that begin with this token are automatically assigned the designated priority in the **Task List**.  
  
 Name  
 Enter the token string. This enables the **Add** button. On **Add**, this string is included in the **Token List**, and comments that begin with this name will be displayed in the **Task List**.  
  
 Add  
 Enabled when you enter a new **Name**. Click to add a new token string using the values entered in the **Name** and **Priority** fields.  
  
 Delete  
 Click to delete the selected token from the **Token List**. You cannot delete the default comment token.  
  
 Change  
 Click to make changes to an existing token using the values entered in the **Name** and **Priority** fields.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot rename or delete the default comment token, but you can change its priority level.
