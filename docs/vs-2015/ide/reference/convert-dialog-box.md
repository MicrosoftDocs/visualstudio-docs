# Convert Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The **Convert** dialog box allows you to select a conversion tool to create a new project from an old one, such as creating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvblong](../../includes/vbprvblong-md.md)] project from a Visual Basic 6 project. You can also use the [Visual Studio Project Converter](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=246465), available on the CodePlex web site, to upgrade projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio.

 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]
