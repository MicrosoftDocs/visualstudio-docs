# /Setup (devenv.exe)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Forces [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] to merge the resource metadata that describes menus, toolbars, and command groups, from all available VSPackages.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
devenv /setup  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This switch takes no arguments. The `devenv /setup` command is typically given as the last step of the installation process. Use of the `/setup` switch does not start [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 You must run `devenv` as an administrator in order to use the [/setup (devenv.exe)](../../ide/reference/setup-devenv-exe.md) and [/InstallVSTemplates (devenv.exe)](../../ide/reference/installvstemplates-devenv-exe.md) switches.  
  
## Example  
 This example shows the last step in the installation of a version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] that includes VSPackages.  
  
```  
devenv /setup  
```
