# Resources for Designing Accessible Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Use the following links to find information about technologies that support accessible design as well as tips and examples for developing accessible Windows applications and Web sites. General information on accessibility can be found online at [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/](http://www.microsoft.com/enable/).  
  
## Technologies  
  
- **Microsoft Active Accessibility** A COM-based technology that improves the way accessibility aids work with applications running on Microsoft Windows. It provides dynamic-link libraries that are incorporated into the operating system as well as a COM interface and application programming elements that provide reliable methods for exposing information about user interface elements. For more information, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373592(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373592\(v=vs.85\).aspx).  
  
- **Microsoft .NET Speech Technologies** The Microsoft .NET Speech SDK is a set of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] controls, a Microsoft Internet Explorer Speech add-in, sample applications and documentation that allows Web developers to create, debug and deploy speech-enabled [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] applications. The tools are integrated seamlessly into Microsoft Visual Studio, allowing developers to leverage the familiar development environment. For more information, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms950383.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms950383.aspx).  
  
- **Understanding SAMI 1.0** Microsoft Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI) technology provides a way for developers to caption audio content for PC multimedia. For more information, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms971327.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms971327.aspx).  
  
## Windows Applications  
  
- [Walkthrough: Creating an Accessible Windows-based Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/654c7f2f-1586-480b-9f12-9d9b8f5cc32b) This topic provides step-by-step instructions for including the five accessibility requirements for the Certified for Windows logo in a sample Windows application.  
  
- [Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/guidelines-for-keyboard-user-interface-design) This technical article describes how design a Windows application user interface that users can navigate from the keyboard.  
  
- [Console Accessibility](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/console-accessibility) This technical article describes the APIs and events used to expose the console in Windows XP for accessibility aids. 
  
## Web Sites  
  
- [Walkthrough: Accessibility Guidelines for Using Image Controls, Menu Controls, and AutoPostBack](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff7b5021-48b3-46bf-921f-9fe1e0e32202) This topic provides step-by-step instructions for including accessible controls in a sample Web page as well as some accessibility design tips for the Web.  
  
- [Making Web Pages More Accessible](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/making-web-pages-more-accessible) This technical article lists HTML 3.2 elements that are accessible as well as elements that can be made accessible for use in Web site development. 
  
- [Creating Accessible Web Pages with DHTML](/previous-versions//ms528445(v=vs.85)) This technical article lists HTML 4.0 elements that are accessible as well as accessible Web design tips. 
  
- [Text Alternatives to Inaccessible Web Pages](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dnacc/text-alternatives-to-inaccessible-web-pages) This technical article describes how to use XML and XSLT to provide multiple views of the same Web page, such as text only versions. 
  
### Third-party Resources  
  
- **Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** This Web site provides guidelines and techniques for accessible Web site development. For more information, see [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/).
