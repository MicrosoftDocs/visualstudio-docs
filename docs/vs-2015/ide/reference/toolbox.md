# Toolbox
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The **Toolbox** displays icons for controls and other items that you can add to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] projects. To open the **Toolbox**, click **Toolbox** on the **View** menu. You can dock the **Toolbox**, and you can pin it open or set it to **Auto Hide**.  
  
 **Toolbox** icons can be dragged to a design view or pasted in a code editor. Either action adds the fundamental code to create an instance of the **Toolbox** item in the active project file.  
  
 The **Toolbox** displays only the items that are appropriate to the type of file you are working in. You can search within the Toolbox to further filter the items that appear. If your project requires a control that is not supported by the Client Profile, you can set your project to target the entire framework by editing the project properties.
