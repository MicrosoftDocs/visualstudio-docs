# /Edit (devenv.exe)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Opens the specified file in an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Devenv /edit [file1[ file2]]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `file1`  
 Optional. The file to open in an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. If no instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] exists, a new instance is created with a simplified window layout, and `file1` is opened in the new instance.  
  
 `file2`  
 Optional. One or more additional files to open in the existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## Remarks  
 If no file is specified and there is an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], the existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] receives focus. If no file is specified and there is no existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], a new instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] is created with a simplified window layout.  
  
 If the existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] is in a modal state, for example, if the [Options dialog box](../../ide/reference/options-dialog-box-visual-studio.md) is open, the file will open in the existing instance when [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] exits the modal state.  
  
## Example  
 This example opens the file `MyFile.cs` in an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] or opens the file in a new instance of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] if one does not already exist.  
  
```  
devenv /edit MyFile.cs  
```
