# File Properties, JavaScript
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can use file properties to indicate what actions the project system should perform on the files. For example, you can set file properties to indicate whether a file should be added to the package as a resource file.  
  
 You can select any file in Solution Explorer and then examine its properties in the Properties window. JavaScript files have four properties: **Copy to Output Directory**, **Package Action**, **File Name**, and **File Path**.  
  
## File Properties  
 This section describes properties common to JavaScript files.  
  
### Copy to Output Directory Property  
 This property specifies the conditions under which the selected source file will be copied to the output directory. Select **Do not copy** if the file is never to be copied to the output directory. Select **Copy always** if the file is always to be copied to the output directory. Select **Copy if newer** if the file is to be copied only when it is newer than an existing file of the same name in the output directory.  
  
### Package Action  
 The **Package Action** property indicates what Visual Studio does with a file when a build is executed. **Package Action** can have one of several values:  
  
- **None** - The file is not included in the package manifest. An example is a text file that contains documentation, such as a Readme file.  
  
- **Content** - The file is included in the package manifest. For example, this setting is the default value for an .htm, .js, .css, image, audio, or video file.  
  
- **Manifest** – The file is not included in the package manifest. Instead, the file is used for input when generating the package manifest. This is the default value for the package.appxmanifest file.  
  
- **Resource** - The file is not included in the package manifest. Instead, the contents of the file are indexed in the Package Resource Index (PRI) that goes into the package manifest. It is typically used for resource files.  
  
  The default value for **Package Action** depends on the extension of the file that you add to the solution.  
  
### File Name Property  
 Displays the file name as a read-only value. To rename the file, you must right-click in Solution Explorer and select **Rename**.  
  
### Full Path Property  
 Displays the full path to the file as a read-only value. To change the path of the file, you can drag-and-drop the file in Solution Explorer.  
  
## Reference File Properties  
 This section describes properties common to files referenced from a [!INCLUDE[win8_app_js](../../includes/win8-app-js-md.md)]. When you select a reference such as a .winmd file, an SDK reference, a project-to-project reference, or an assembly reference in Solution Explorer, other properties may display in the Properties window, according to the file type.  
  
### Culture  
 Displays the language associated with the reference.  
  
### File Type  
 Displays the file type of the reference.  
  
### File Version  
 Displays the file version of the reference.  
  
### Identity  
 Displays the identity of the reference that is used in the project, which is stored in the project file.  
  
### Package  
 Displays the name of the package manifest associated with the reference.  
  
### Resolved Path  
 Displays the path to the reference that is used in the project.  
  
### SDK Path  
 Displays the path to the referenced SDK file.  
  
### Uri  
 Displays the URI that must be included in the project’s HTML or JavaScript files to include the file as a source file.  
  
### Version  
 Displays the version of the reference.
