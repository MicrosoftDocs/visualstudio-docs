# /SafeMode (devenv.exe)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Starts [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] in safe mode, loading only the default environment and services.

devenv /SafeMode   
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This switch prevents all third-party VSPackages from loading when [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] starts, thus ensuring stable execution.  
  
## Description

## Code  
  
```  
Devenv.exe /SafeMode
