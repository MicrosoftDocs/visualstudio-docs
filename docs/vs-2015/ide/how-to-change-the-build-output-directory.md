# How to: Change the Build Output Directory
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can specify the location of output on a per-configuration basis (for debug, release, or both) generated by your project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have a **Setup** project see the note at the end of this article.  
  
## Changing the Build Output directory  
  
#### To change the build output directory  
  
1. On the menu bar, choose **Project**, *Appname* **Properties**. You can also right-click the project node in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**.  
  
2. If you have a Visual Basic project, select the **Compile** tab. If you have a Visual C# project, select the **Build** tab. If you have a C++ project or a JavaScript project, select the **General** tab.  
  
3. In the configuration drop-down at the top, choose the configuration whose output file location you want to change (debug, release, or all).  
  
     Find the output path entry (**Build output path** in Visual Basic, **Output Directory** in Visual C++, **Output Path** in JavaScript and C#). Specify a new build output directory relative to the project directory.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In a Setup Project, the **Output file name** box changes only the location of the Setup.exe file, not the location of the project files. For more information, see **Build, Configuration Properties, Deployment Project Properties Dialog Box**.
