# How to: Create and Edit Configurations
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can create several build configurations for a solution. For example, you can configure a debug build that your testers can use to find and fix problems, and you can configure different kinds of builds that you can distribute to different customers.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
## Creating Build Configurations  
 You can use the **Configuration Manager** dialog box to select or modify existing build configurations, or you can create new ones.  
  
#### To open the Configuration Manager dialog box  
  
- In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the solution and then choose **Configuration Manager**.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If the **Configuration Manager** command doesn't appear on the shortcut menu, look under the **Build** menu on the menu bar. If it doesn't appear there either, on the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Options**, and then in the left pane of the **Options** dialog box, expand **Projects and Solutions**, **General**, and in the right pane, select the **Show advanced build configurations** check box.  
  
   In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, you can use the **Active solution configuration** drop-down list to select a solution-wide build configuration, modify an existing one, or create a new configuration. You can use the **Active solution platform** drop-down list to select the platform that the configuration targets, modify an existing one, or add a new platform. The **Project contexts** pane lists the projects in the solution. For each project, you can select a project-specific configuration and platform, modify existing ones, or create a new configuration or add a new platform. You can also select check boxes that indicate whether each project is included when you use the solution-wide configuration to build or deploy the solution.  
  
  After you set up the configurations you want, you can set project properties that are appropriate for those configurations.  
  
#### To set properties based on configurations  
  
- In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for a project and then choose **Properties**.  
  
     The  **Property Pages** window opens.  
  
     You can set properties for your configurations. For example, for a Release configuration, you can specify that code is optimized when the solution is built, and for a Debug configuration, you can specify that the `DEBUG` conditional compilation symbol is included. For more information about property page settings, see [Introduction to the Project Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/898dd854-c98d-430c-ba1b-a913ce3c73d7).  
  
## Creating and Modifying Project Configurations  
  
#### To create a project configuration  
  
1. Open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
2. Select a project in the **Project** column.  
  
3. In the **Configuration** drop-down list for that project, choose **New**.  
  
     The **New Project Configuration** dialog box opens.  
  
4. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the new configuration.  
  
5. To use the property settings from an existing project configuration,  in the **Copy settings from** drop-down list, choose a configuration.  
  
6. To create a solution-wide configuration at the same time, select the **Create new solution configuration** check box.  
  
#### To rename a project configuration  
  
1. Open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
2. In the **Project** column, select the project that has the project configuration you want to rename.  
  
3. In the **Configuration** drop-down list for that project, choose **Edit**.  
  
     The **Edit Project Configurations** dialog box opens.  
  
4. Select the project configuration name you want to change.  
  
5. Select **Rename**, and then enter a new name.  
  
## Creating and Modifying Solution-wide Build Configurations  
  
#### To create a solution-wide build configuration  
  
1. Open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
2. In the **Active solution configuration** drop-down list, choose **New**.  
  
     The **New Solution Configuration** dialog box opens.  
  
3. In the **Name** text box, enter a name for the new configuration.  
  
4. To use the settings from an existing solution configuration, in the **Copy settings from** drop-down list, choose a configuration.  
  
5. If you want to create project configurations at the same time, select the **Create new project configurations** check box.  
  
#### To rename a solution-wide build configuration  
  
1. Open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
2. In the **Active solution configuration** drop-down list, choose **Edit**.  
  
     The **Edit Solution Configurations** dialog box opens.  
  
3. Select the solution configuration name you want to change.  
  
4. Select **Rename**, and then enter a new name.  
  
#### To modify a solution-wide build configuration  
  
1. Open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
2. In the **Active solution configuration** drop-down list, select the configuration you want.  
  
3. In the **Project contexts** pane, for every project, select the **Configuration** and **Platform** you want, and select whether to **Build** it and whether to **Deploy** it..
