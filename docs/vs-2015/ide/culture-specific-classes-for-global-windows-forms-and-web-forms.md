# Culture-Specific Classes for Global Windows Forms and Web Forms
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Each culture has different conventions for displaying dates, time, numbers, currency, and other information. The <xref:System.Globalization> namespace contains classes that can be used to modify how culture-specific values are displayed, such as <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo>, **Calendar**, and <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo>.  
  
## Using the Culture Setting  
 But most of the time you will use the culture setting, stored either in the application or in the **Regional Options** control panel, to automatically determine the conventions at run time and format the information accordingly. For more information on setting the culture, see [How to: Set the Culture and UI Culture for Windows Forms Globalization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/694e049f-0b91-474a-9789-d35124f248f0) or [How to: Set the Culture and UI Culture for ASP.NET Web Page Globalization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/76091f86-f967-4687-a40f-de87bd8cc9a0). Classes that automatically format information according to the culture setting are called culture-specific. Some culture-specific methods are <xref:System.IFormattable.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. Some culture-specific functions (in the Visual Basic language) are `MonthName` and `WeekDayName`.  
  
 For example, the following code shows how you can use the <xref:System.IFormattable.ToString%2A> method to format currency for the current culture:  
  
```vb  
' Put the Imports statements at the beginning of the code module  
Imports System.Threading  
Imports System.Globalization  
' Display a number with the culture-specific currency formatting  
Dim MyInt As Integer = 100  
Console.WriteLine(MyInt.ToString("C", Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture))  
  
```  
  
```csharp  
// Put the using statements at the beginning of the code module  
using System.Threading;  
using System.Globalization;  
// Display a number with the culture-specific currency formatting  
int myInt = 100;  
Console.WriteLine(myInt.ToString("C", Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture));  
```  
  
 If the culture is set to "fr-FR", you will see this in the output window:  
  
 `100,00`  
  
 If the culture is set to "en-US", you will see this in the output window:  
  
 `$100.00`
