# How to: Set Multiple Startup Projects
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Visual Studio allows you to specify how more than one project is run when you start the debugger.

### To set multiple startup projects

1. In the **Solution Explorer**, select the solution (the very top node). Right-click the node to get the context menu.

2. Select **Properties**. The **Solution Property Pages** dialog box opens.

3. Expand the **Common Properties** node, and click **Startup Project**.

4. Click **Multiple Startup Projects** and set the appropriate actions. For more information, see [NIB How to: Modify Project Properties and Configuration Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/e7184bc5-2f2b-4b4f-aa9a-3ecfcbc48b67).
