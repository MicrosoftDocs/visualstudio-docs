# Getting Started with Visual C# and Visual Basic
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Whether you are new to Visual C# or Microsoft Visual Basic, this is the place to start. Getting Started Help is a series of sequential lessons that introduces you to Visual C# and Visual Basic. Have fun, and write some great software.

 To learn about Visual C++, see [Visual C++ resources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/hh386302.aspx).

## In This Section
 [Walkthrough: Create a Simple Application](../ide/walkthrough-create-a-simple-application-with-visual-csharp-or-visual-basic.md)
 Identify the basic windows in the Visual Studio IDE, optimize your development experience by configuring a setting, and then build a simple program.

 [Tutorial 1: Create a Picture Viewer](../ide/tutorial-1-create-a-picture-viewer.md)
 Build a program that loads a picture from a file and displays it in a window. Learn how to drag controls like buttons and picture boxes on your form, set their properties, and use containers to smoothly resize the form. Get started writing code.

 [Tutorial 2: Create a Timed Math Quiz](../ide/tutorial-2-create-a-timed-math-quiz.md)
 Build a timed math quiz game, where the player must answer four random arithmetic problems within a specified time. Learn how to generate random numbers using the `Random` class, trigger events using a `Timer` control, control program flow using `if else` statements, and perform basic arithmetic operations.

 [Tutorial 3: Create a Matching Game](../ide/tutorial-3-create-a-matching-game.md)
 Build a matching game, where the player must match pairs of hidden icons. Learn how to hold objects using a `List` object, use a `foreach` loop, keep track of a form's state using reference variables, build an event handler that you can use with multiple objects, and make a timer fire exactly once when started.
