# Designing and Viewing Classes and Types
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Design, visualize, and refactor classes and other types in your code with Class Designer in Visual Studio. Use class diagrams to create and edit classes in your Visual C# .NET, Visual Basic .NET, or C++ project, understand your project structure better, or reorganize your code.

 Here's more about what you can do with class diagrams:

- **Design**: Edit your project's code by editing the class diagram. Add new elements and delete unwanted ones. Your changes are reflected in code.

- **Visualize**: Understand your project's structure by viewing the classes in your project on a diagram. Customize your diagram so that you can focus on the project details that you care about the most. Save your diagram to use later for demonstration or documentation.

- **Refactor**: Override methods, rename identifiers, refactor parameters, and implement interfaces and abstract classes.
