# How to: Add Comments to Class Diagrams (Class Designer)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can use comment shapes to annotate class diagrams. A comment shape has one property, **Text**, into which you can type text. Comment shapes exist only on the diagram surface and not in code.  
  
 A comment resides on the class diagramview in **Class Designer**; if you open a second class diagram onto the same project, comments you created in the first view are not visible. If you delete a diagram, all the comments it contained are also deleted.  
  
 You can resize a comment shape but you cannot change other aspects of its appearance, such as its background color, font, or font size.  
  
### To add a comment  
  
1. Drag a comment from the **Class Designer Toolbox** onto the class diagram.  
  
2. Click in the new comment shape on the diagram and type the text you want.
