# How to: Manage Build Configurations with Visual Basic Developer Settings Applied
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

By default, all advanced build configuration options are hidden with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] Developer settings applied. This topic explains how to manually enable these settings.  
  
## Enabling advanced build configurations  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] Developer settings hide the option to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists in the [Project Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/898dd854-c98d-430c-ba1b-a913ce3c73d7).  
  
#### To enable advanced build configurations  
  
1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2. Expand **Projects and Solutions**, and click **General**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **General** node is visible even if the **Show all settings** option is unchecked. If you want to see every option available, click **Show all settings**.  
  
3. Click **Show advanced build configurations**.  
  
4. Click **OK**.  
  
     On the **Build** menu, **Configuration Manager** is now available, and the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists are visible in the Project Designer.
