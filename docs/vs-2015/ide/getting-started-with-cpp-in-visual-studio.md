# Getting Started with C++ in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

By completing this walkthrough, you’ll become familiar with many of the tools and dialog boxes that you can use when you develop applications with Visual Studio. You’ll create a simple "Hello, World"-style application while you learn more about working in the integrated development environment (IDE).

 This topic contains the following sections:

 [Sign In to Visual Studio](../ide/getting-started-with-cpp-in-visual-studio.md#BKMK_Configure)

 [Create a simple application](../ide/getting-started-with-cpp-in-visual-studio.md#BKMK_CreateApp)

 [Add Code to the Application](../ide/getting-started-with-cpp-in-visual-studio.md#BKMK_AddCode)

 [Debug and Test the application](../ide/getting-started-with-cpp-in-visual-studio.md#BKMK_DebugTest)

 [Build a release version of the app](../ide/getting-started-with-cpp-in-visual-studio.md#BKMK_BuildRelease)

## <a name="BKMK_Configure"></a> Sign In to Visual Studio
 When you start Visual Studio for the first time, you are given the chance to sign in using a Microsoft account such as Live or Outlook. Signing in allows your settings to be synchronized across all your devices. For more information, see [Signing in to Visual Studio](../ide/signing-in-to-visual-studio.md)

 Figure 1: Visual Studio IDE

 After you open Visual Studio, you can see the three basic parts of the IDE: tool windows, menus and toolbars, and the main window space. Tool windows are docked on the left and right sides of the app window, with **Quick Launch**, the menu bar, and the standard toolbar at the top. The center of the application window contains the **Start Page**. When you open a solution or project, editors and designers appear in this space. When you develop an application, you’ll spend most of your time in this central area.

## <a name="BKMK_CreateApp"></a> Create a simple application
 When you create an app in Visual Studio, you first create a project and a solution. For this example, you’ll create a Windows console application.

#### To create a console app

1. On the menu bar, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.

    ![On the menu bar, choose File, New, Project](../ide/media/exploreide-filenewproject.png "ExploreIDE-FileNewProject")

2. In the **Visual C++** category, choose the **Win32 Console Application** template, and then name the project `GreetingsConsoleApp`.

    ![Win32 Console application template](../ide/media/c-ide-newprojectdlg.png "C++IDE_NewProjectDlg")

3. When the Win32 Application Wizard appears, choose the **Finish** button.

    ![Win32 Console application wizard](../ide/media/c-ide-win32consoleappwizard.png "C++IDE_Win32ConsoleAppWizard")

   The GreetingsConsoleApp project and solution, with the basic files for a Win32 console app, are created and automatically loaded into **Solution Explorer**. The GreetingsConsoleApp.cpp file is opened in the code editor. The following items appear in **Solution Explorer**:

   Figure 4: Project items

   ![Files for the solution in Solution Explorer](../ide/media/c-ide-solutioncontents.png "C++IDE_SolutionContents")

## <a name="BKMK_AddCode"></a> Add Code to the Application
 Next, you'll add code to display the word "Hello" in the console window.

#### To display “Hello” in the console window

1. In the GreetingsConsoleApp.cpp file, enter a blank line before the line `return 0;` and then enter the following code:

    ```
    cout << "Hello\n";
    ```

     A red squiggly line appears under `cout`. An error message appears if you point to it.

     ![Error text for cout](../ide/media/c-ide-couterror.png "C++IDE_CoutError")

     The error message also appears in the **Error List** window. You can display the window by, on the menu bar, choosing **View**, **Error List**.

     [cout](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d87db6c3-e4e1-4d09-9ec5-458f55018257) is included in the \<iostream\> header file.

2. To include the iostream header, enter the following code after `#include "stdafx.h"`:

    ```
    #include \<iostream\>
    using namespace std;
    ```

     You probably noticed that a box appeared as you entered code, providing suggestions for the characters that you entered. This box is part of C++ IntelliSense, which provides coding prompts, including listing class or interface members and parameter information. You can also use code snippets, which are pre-defined blocks of code. For more information, see [Using IntelliSense](../ide/using-intellisense.md) and [Code Snippets](../ide/code-snippets.md).

     The red squiggly line under `cout` disappears when you fix the error.

3. Save the changes to the file.

     ![Code that fixes cout error](../ide/media/c-ide-coutfix.png "C++IDE_CoutFix")

## <a name="BKMK_DebugTest"></a> Debug and Test the application
 You can debug GreetingsConsoleApp to see whether the word "Hello" appears in the console window.

#### To debug the application

- Start the debugger.

     ![Start Debugging command on the Debug menu](../ide/media/exploreide-startdebugging.png "ExploreIDE-StartDebugging")

     The debugger starts and runs the code. The console window (a separate window that looks like a command prompt) appears for a few seconds but closes quickly when the debugger stops running. To see the text, you need to set a breakpoint to stop program execution.

#### To add a breakpoint

1. Add a breakpoint from the menu bar at the line `return 0;`. You can also just click in the left margin to set a breakpoint.

    ![Toggle Breakpoint command on the Debug menu](../ide/media/exploreide-togglebreakpoint.png "ExploreIDE-ToggleBreakpoint")

    A red circle appears next to the line of code in the far left margin of the editor window.

2. Choose the F5 key to start debugging.

    The debugger starts, and a console window appears showing the word **Hello**.

    ![Hello text in the Windows Command Prompt window](../ide/media/c-ide-hellocommandwindow.png "C++IDE_HelloCommandWindow")

3. Press SHIFT + F5 to stop debugging.

   For more information, see [Console Projects](../debugger/debugging-preparation-console-projects.md).

## <a name="BKMK_BuildRelease"></a> Build a release version of the app
 Now that you’ve verified that everything works, you can prepare a release build of the application.

#### To clean the solution files and build a release version

1. From the menu bar, delete intermediate files and output files that were created during previous builds.

    ![The Clean Solution command on the Build menu](../ide/media/exploreide-cleansolution.png "ExploreIDE-CleanSolution")

2. Change the build configuration for GreetingsConsoleApp from **Debug** to **Release**.

    ![Build a release version of the application](../ide/media/c-ide-changingbuildtorelease.png "C++IDE_ChangingBuildtoRelease")

3. Build the solution.

    ![Build Solution command on the Build menu](../ide/media/exploreide-buildsolution.png "ExploreIDE-BuildSolution")
