# How to: Create Inheritance Between Types (Class Designer) 
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To create an inheritance relationship between two types on a class diagram using Class Designer, connect the base type with its derived type or types. You can have an inheritance relationship between two classes, between a class and an interface, or between two interfaces.  
  
### To create an inheritance between types  
  
1. From your project in Solution Explorer, open a class diagram (.cd) file.  
  
     If you don't have a class diagram, create it. See [How to: Add Class Diagrams to Projects (Class Designer)](../ide/how-to-add-class-diagrams-to-projects-class-designer.md).  
  
2. In the **Toolbox**, under **Class Designer**, click **Inheritance**.  
  
3. On the class diagram, draw an inheritance line between the types that you want, starting from:  
  
    - A derived class to the base class  
  
    - An implementing class to the implemented interface  
  
    - An extending interface to the extended interface  
  
4. Optionally, when you have a derived type from a generic type, click the inheritance line. In the **Properties** window, set the **Type Arguments** property to match the type that you want for the generic type.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If a parent abstract class contains at least one abstract member, then all abstract members are implemented as non-abstract inheriting classes.   
    >   
    >  Although you can visualize existing generic types, you can't create new generic types. You also can't change the type parameters for existing generic types.
