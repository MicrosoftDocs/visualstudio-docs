# Sample Project for Creating Unit Tests
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This sample code is provided for use in the following walkthroughs:  
  
- [Walkthrough: Creating and Running Unit Tests for Managed Code](../test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code.md). This walkthrough leads you through the steps to create and customize unit tests, run them, and examine the test results.  
  
- [Walkthrough: Run tests and view code coverage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/d4aab8e2-2140-4975-b4e3-41ef3fa944c8). This walkthrough illustrates  how to view code coverage data, which shows the proportion of your project's code that is being tested.  
  
- [Walkthrough: using the command-line test utility](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/52c11992-9e94-4067-a4b7-59f19d69d867). In this walkthrough, you use the MSTest.exe command-line utility to run tests and view results.  
  
## Sample Code  
 The only intentional error in this sample is that the in Debit method "m_balance += amount" should have a minus not a plus sign before the equals sign.  
  
```  
using System;   
  
namespace BankAccountNS  
{  
    /// <summary>   
    /// Bank Account demo class.   
    /// </summary>   
    public class BankAccount  
    {  
        private string m_customerName;  
  
        private double m_balance;  
  
        private bool m_frozen = false;  
  
        private BankAccount()  
        {  
        }  
  
        public BankAccount(string customerName, double balance)  
        {  
            m_customerName = customerName;  
            m_balance = balance;  
        }  
  
        public string CustomerName  
        {  
            get { return m_customerName; }  
        }  
  
        public double Balance  
        {  
            get { return m_balance; }  
        }  
  
        public void Debit(double amount)  
        {  
            if (m_frozen)  
            {  
                throw new Exception("Account frozen");  
            }  
  
            if (amount > m_balance)  
            {  
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");  
            }  
  
            if (amount < 0)  
            {  
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");  
            }  
  
            m_balance += amount; // intentionally incorrect code  
        }  
  
        public void Credit(double amount)  
        {  
            if (m_frozen)  
            {  
                throw new Exception("Account frozen");  
            }  
  
            if (amount < 0)  
            {  
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");  
            }  
  
            m_balance += amount;  
        }  
  
        private void FreezeAccount()  
        {  
            m_frozen = true;  
        }  
  
        private void UnfreezeAccount()  
        {  
            m_frozen = false;  
        }  
  
        public static void Main()  
        {  
            BankAccount ba = new BankAccount("Mr. Bryan Walton", 11.99);   
  
            ba.Credit(5.77);  
            ba.Debit(11.22);  
            Console.WriteLine("Current balance is ${0}", ba.Balance);  
        }  
  
    }  
}  
```

## Working with the Code  
 To work with this code, you first have to create a project for it in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. Follow the steps in the "Prepare the Walkthrough" section in [Walkthrough: Creating and Running Unit Tests for Managed Code](../test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code.md).
