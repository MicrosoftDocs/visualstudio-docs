# Install third-party unit test frameworks
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Visual Studio Test Explorer can run any unit test framework that has developed an adapter interface for the Explorer. The install program of the framework installs the binaries and adds Visual Studio project templates for the languages it supports. When you create a project with the template, the framework is registered with Test Explorer. A Visual Studio solution can contain unit test projects that use different frameworks and that are targeted at different languages. Test Explorer runs them all.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
- Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Professional  
  
## Acquiring third-party frameworks  
 You can download and install many third-party unit test frameworks by using the Visual Studio Extension Manager, or from the Visual Studio Gallery on the MSDN website. Frameworks can also be downloaded from other sites such as the website of the framework.
