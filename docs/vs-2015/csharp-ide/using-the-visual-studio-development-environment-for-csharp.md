# Using the Visual Studio Development Environment for C\#

[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) is a collection of development tools exposed through a common user interface. Some of the tools are shared with other [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] languages, and some, such as the C# compiler, are unique to Visual C#. This topic provides links to the most important Visual C# tools.
