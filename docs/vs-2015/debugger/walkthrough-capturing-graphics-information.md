# Walkthrough: Capturing Graphics Information
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Graphics Diagnostics to manually capture graphics information from a Direct3D app.  
  
 This walkthrough illustrates these tasks:  
  
- Hooking Graphics Diagnostics to your app  
  
- Capturing graphics information  
  
## Capturing graphics information  
 To use the Graphics Diagnostics tools, you first have to capture the graphics information that it relies on. To enable capture, use the **Start Diagnostics** command to hook Graphics Diagnostics to your app when it starts.  
  
#### To enable the capture of graphics information after a project or solution is loaded  
  
1. In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], load a project or solution file for the app that you want to capture graphics information from.  
  
2. On the Graphics Diagnostics toolbar, choose **Start Diagnostics**.  
  
#### To enable the capture of graphics information without loading a project or solution  
  
1. On the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open**, **Project/Solution**. The **Open Project** dialog box appears.  
  
2. Instead of a project or solution file, specify the executable file for the app that you want to capture graphics information from, and then choose **Open**.  
  
3. On the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Graphics**, **Start Diagnostics**.  
  
   After you start the app and it is rendering frames, you can capture graphics information.  
  
#### To capture graphics information  
  
- On the Graphics Diagnostics toolbar, choose the **Capture** button. ![Graphics capture button icon](../debugger/media/debuggingdirectxgraphics.png "DebuggingDirectXGraphics")  
  
   -or-  
  
   With the app in focus, press **Print Screen**.  
  
  Each time you capture information about a frame, Graphics Diagnostics records the Direct3D events and associated state and adds that data to a graphics log. A new graphics log is created for each Graphics Diagnostics session. For information about graphics logs, see [Overview](../debugger/overview-of-visual-studio-graphics-diagnostics.md).  
  
## Next Steps  
 This walkthrough demonstrated how to capture graphics information manually. As a next step, consider this option:  
  
- Learn how to analyze captured graphics information using the Graphics Diagnostics tools. See [Overview](../debugger/overview-of-visual-studio-graphics-diagnostics.md).
