# COM and ActiveX Debugging
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This section provides tips on debugging COM applications and ActiveX controls.  
  
## In This Section  
 [COM Server and Container Debugging](../debugger/com-server-and-container-debugging.md)  
 Mentions special considerations when debugging COM applications. Issues include: debugging a COM server and container using two projects within the same solution, tracing into calls that go across process boundaries, setting breakpoints in callback functions, and stepping across and into containers and servers.  
  
 [How to: Debug an ActiveX Control](../debugger/how-to-debug-an-activex-control.md)  
 Contains information on debugging ActiveX controls. This includes: specifying a container for the debug session to see how the code in your ActiveX control executes, debugging a data-bound ActiveX control, simulating a particular container, and stepping into the container's code.  
  
 [COM Debugging Tools](../debugger/com-debugging-tools.md)  
 Lists viewers and sample applications that may be useful in debugging your COM application.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugging in Visual Studio](../debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Provides links to the larger sections of the debugging documentation. Information includes: what's new in the debugger, settings and preparation, breakpoints, handling exceptions, edit and continue, debugging managed code, debugging Visual C++ projects, debugging COM and ActiveX, debugging DLLs, debugging SQL, and the user interface references.
