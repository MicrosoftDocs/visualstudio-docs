# How Can I Find Out If My Pointers Corrupt a Memory Address?
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Problem Description  
 I think that one of my pointers may be corrupting memory at address 0x00408000. How can I find out what is happening there?  
  
## Solution  
  
#### Check for heap corruption  
  
- Most memory corruption is actually due to heap corruption. Try using the Global Flags Utility (gflags.exe) or pageheap.exe. See [GFlags and PageHeap](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags-and-pageheap) and [How to use the PageHeap utility to detect memory errors in a Microsoft Visual C++ project](https://support.microsoft.com/help/264471/how-to-use-the-pageheap-utility-to-detect-memory-errors-in-a-microsoft).
  
#### To find where the memory address is modified  
  
1. Set a data breakpoint at 0x00408000. See [Set a data change breakpoint (native C++ only)](../debugger/using-breakpoints.md#BKMK_set_a_data_breakpoint_native_cplusplus_only).  
  
2. When you hit the breakpoint, use the **Memory** window to view memory contents starting at 0x00408000. For more information, see [Memory Windows](../debugger/memory-windows.md).
