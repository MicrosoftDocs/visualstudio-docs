 The debugger provides two windows for debugging inline assembly code, the **Disassembly** window and the **Registers** window.  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To debug inline assembly code  
  
1. Use the **Disassembly** window to view the assembly instructions.  
  
2. Use the **Registers** window to view register contents.
