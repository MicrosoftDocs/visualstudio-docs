# Init
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Prepares the in-app component of graphics diagnostics to actively capture and record graphics information to a graphics log file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void Init(  
  std::function<void (int len, wchar_t * pszBuffer)> vsgLogGetter  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `vsgLogGetter`  
 A callable entity—such as a function, function pointer, lambda, or function object—that takes as parameters the length of a buffer composed of `wchar_t` and a pointer to that buffer, and returns `void`. When invoked, the callable entity determines the file name that will be used to record graphics information, and writes it to the specified buffer before returning.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Init` function is called automatically when an instance of the `VsgDbg` class is constructed by specifying the `bDefaultInit` parameter of its constructor as `true`; otherwise, `Init` must be called explicitly before you can actively capture and record graphics information.  
  
 You can finalize and close the active graphics log file by calling `UnInit`, and then capture and record more graphics information to a new graphics log file by calling `Init` again. You can repeat this as many times as you want to create several independent graphics log files by using the same `VsgDbg` instance.
