# Error: ASP.NET Not Installed
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This error occurs when [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] is not installed correctly on the computer that you are trying to debug. This might mean that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] was never installed or that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] was installed first and IIS was installed later.  
  
### To reinstall ASP.NET  
  
1. From a command prompt window, run the following command:  
  
    ```  
    \WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version\aspnet_regiis -i  
    ```  
  
     where *version* represents the version number of the .NET Framework installed on your computer, such as v1.0.370. You can determine the framework version by looking in the `\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework` directory.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > With Windows Server 2003, you can install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] by using **Add or Remove Programs** in Control Panel.
