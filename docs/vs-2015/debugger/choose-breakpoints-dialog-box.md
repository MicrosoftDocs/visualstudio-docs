# Choose Breakpoints Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The **Choose Breakpoints** dialog box opens when you try to set a breakpoint from ambiguous input in the **New Breakpoint** dialog box. A common example of ambiguous input is an overloaded function name.  
  
 **Breakpoints**  
 Lists possible breakpoints that can be set based on the ambiguous input. You can select one or more breakpoints to set.  
  
 **All**  
 Selects all breakpoints listed in the **Breakpoints** box.  
  
 **None**  
 Clears all breakpoints listed in the **Breakpoints** box.
