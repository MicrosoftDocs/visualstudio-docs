# Enabling Debug Features in Visual C++ (/D_DEBUG)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../includes/vcprvc-md.md)], debugging features such as assertions are enabled when you compile your program with the symbol **_DEBUG** defined. You can define **_DEBUG** in one of two ways:  
  
- Specify **#define _DEBUG** in your source code, or  
  
- Specify the **/D_DEBUG** compiler option. (If you create your project in Visual Studio using wizards, **/D_DEBUG** is defined automatically in the Debug configuration.)  
  
  When **_DEBUG** is defined, the compiler compiles sections of code surrounded by **#ifdef _DEBUG** and `#endif`.  
  
  The Debug configuration of an MFC program must link with a Debug version of the MFC library. The MFC header files determine the correct version of the MFC library to link with based on the symbols you have defined, such as **_DEBUG** and **_UNICODE**. For details, see [MFC Library Versions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3d7a8ae1-e276-4cf8-ba63-360c2f85ad0e).
