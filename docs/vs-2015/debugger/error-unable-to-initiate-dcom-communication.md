# Error: Unable to initiate DCOM communication
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A DCOM error occurred when the local machine tried to communicate with the remote machine. This is caused by a firewall on the remote server or broken Windows authentication on the remote machine.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- If the remote machine has Windows Firewall enabled, see [Set Up the Remote Tools on the Device](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/90f45630-0d26-4698-8c1f-63f85a12db9c) for instructions about how to configure the firewall for local debugging.  
  
- To restore Windows authentication, try rebooting both machines. Examine event logs on local and remote machines for Kerberos errors and contact domain administrators for known problems.
