# Error: Mixed mode debugging for IA64 processes is unsupported
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] debugger does not support debugging mixed native and managed code in an Itanium-based process.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Build a 32-bit version of your application for debugging.
