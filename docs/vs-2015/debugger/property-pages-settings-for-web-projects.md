You can change the property settings for a web site debug configuration in the **Property Pages** dialog box, as discussed in [Debug and Release Configurations](../debugger/how-to-set-debug-and-release-configurations.md). The following tables show where to find debugger-related settings in the **Property Pages** dialog box.
