# UnInit
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Finalizes the graphics log file, closes it, and frees resources that were used while the app was actively recording graphics information.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void UnInit();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 `UnInit` is called automatically when an instance of the `VsgDbg` class is destroyed. If the `VsgDbg` instance was not actively recording graphics information, this has no effect.  
  
 After `UnInit` has been called on an instance of the `VsgDbg` class, a new graphics log file can be created by calling `Init` and finalized by calling `UnInit`. You can repeat this as many times as you want to use the same `VsgDbg` instance to create several independent graphics log files.
