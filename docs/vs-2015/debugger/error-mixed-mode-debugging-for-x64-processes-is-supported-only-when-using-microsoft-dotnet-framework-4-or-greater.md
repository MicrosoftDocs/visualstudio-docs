# Error: Mixed-mode debugging for x64 processes is supported only when using Microsoft .NET Framework 4 or greater
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To debug mixed native and managed code in a 64-bit process, you must have [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 4. Mixed-mode debugging of 64-bit processes with [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] versions earlier than 4 is not supported.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
- Perform one of the following steps:  
  
  - Upgrade your [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] to version 4.  

  - Build a 32-bit version of your application for debugging.
