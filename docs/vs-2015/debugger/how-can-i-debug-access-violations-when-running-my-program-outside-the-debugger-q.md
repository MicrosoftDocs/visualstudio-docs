# How Can I Debug Access Violations When Running My Program Outside the Debugger?
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Problem Description  
 My program runs fine in the Visual Studio environment, but when I run it stand-alone with the Windows operating system, it produces an access violation. How can I debug this problem?  
  
## Solution  
 Set the [Just-in-time debugging](../debugger/just-in-time-debugging-in-visual-studio.md) option and run your program stand-alone until the access violation occurs. Then, in the **Access Violation** dialog box, you can click **Cancel** to start the debugger.  
  
 Also see the Knowledge Base article Q133174, "How to Locate Where a General Protection (GP) Fault Occurs." You can find Knowledge Base articles on the MSDN Library CD or by searching [http://support.microsoft.com/](https://support.microsoft.com/).
