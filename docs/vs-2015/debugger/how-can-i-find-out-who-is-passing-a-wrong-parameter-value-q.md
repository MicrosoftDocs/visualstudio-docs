# How Can I Find Out Who Is Passing a Wrong Parameter Value?
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Problem Description  
 The wrong parameter value is being passed to one of my functions. This function is called from all over the place. How can I find out what is passing it the wrong value?  
  
## Solution  
  
#### To resolve this problem  
  
1. Set a location breakpoint at the beginning of the function.  
  
2. Right-click the breakpoint and select **Condition**.  
  
3. In the **Breakpoint Condition** dialog box, click on the **Condition** check box. See [Advanced Breakpoints](../debugger/using-breakpoints.md#BKMK_Specify_a_breakpoint_condition_using_a_code_expression).  
  
4. Enter an expression, such as `Var==3`, into the text box, where `Var` is the name of the parameter that contains the bad value, and `3` is the bad value passed to it.  
  
5. Select the **is True** radio button, and click the **OK** button.  
  
6. Now run the program again. The breakpoint causes the program to halt at the beginning of the function when the `Var` parameter has the value `3`.  
  
7. Use the Call Stack window to find the calling function and navigate to its source code. For more information, see [How to: Use the Call Stack Window](../debugger/how-to-use-the-call-stack-window.md).
