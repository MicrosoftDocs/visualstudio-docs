# How to: Enable and Disable Edit and Continue
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can disable or enable Edit and Continue in the **Options** dialog box at design time. You cannot change this setting while you are debugging.  
  
 Edit and Continue works only in debug builds. For native C++, Edit and Continue requires using the /INCREMENTAL option.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### To enable/disable Edit and Continue  
  
1. Open debugging options page (**Tools / Options / Debugging**).  
  
2. Scroll down to **Edit and Continue** category.  
  
3. To enable, select the **Enable Edit and Continue** check box. To disable, clear the check box.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > If IntelliTrace is enabled and you collect both IntelliTrace events and call information, Edit and Continue is disabled. For more information, see [Configure IntelliTrace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/7657ecab-e07e-4b1b-872d-f05d966be37e).  
  
4. Click **OK**.  
  
   For more information about these options, see [General, Debugging, Options Dialog Box](../debugger/general-debugging-options-dialog-box.md).
