# How to: Debug the OnStart Method
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can debug a Windows service by starting the service and attaching the debugger to the service process. For more information, see [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/63ab0800-0f05-4f1e-88e6-94c73fd920a2). However, to debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method of a Windows service, you must launch the debugger from inside the method.  
  
1. Add a call to <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch%2A> at the beginning of the `OnStart()`method.  
  
    ```csharp  
    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)  
    {  
        System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch();  
     }  
    ```  
  
2. Start the service (you can use `net start`, or start it in the **Services** window).  
  
     You should see a dialog box like the following:  
  
     ![OnStartDebug](../debugger/media/onstartdebug.png "OnStartDebug")  
  
3. Select **Yes, debug \<service name>.**  
  
4. In the Just-In-Time Debugger window, select the version of Visual Studio you want to use for debugging.  
  
     ![JustInTimeDebugger](../debugger/media/justintimedebugger.png "JustInTimeDebugger")  
  
5. A new instance of Visual Studio starts, and execution is stopped at the `Debugger.Launch()` method.
