# How Can I Use Debugger Windows While Debugging a Foreground Program?
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Problem Description  
 I am trying to debug a screen-painting problem. To observe this problem, I have to keep my program in the foreground, which means I do not have access to the debugging windows. What can I do?  
  
## Solution  
 If you have a second computer, you can use remote debugging. With a two-computer setup, you can watch the screen painting on the remote computer while you operate the debugger on the host. For more information on remote debugging, see [Setting Up Remote Debugging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/90f45630-0d26-4698-8c1f-63f85a12db9c).
