# Error: The Web Server Could Not Find the Requested Resource
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Due to security considerations, IIS has returned a generic error.  
  
 One possible cause is the security configuration of the server. IIS 6.0 and earlier versions used an add-on program, known as URLScan, to filter out suspicious and malformed requests. IIS 7.0 has built-in Request Filtering for the same purpose. In both cases, overly restrictive request filtering can prevent Visual Studio from debugging the server.  
  
 There are numerous possible causes of this error. A few of the most common causes include a problem with the IIS installation or configuration, the web site configuration, or permissions in the file system. You can try accessing the resource with a browser. Depending on how IIS is configured you might have to use a local browser on the server or inspect the IIS error log to get a detailed error message.  
  
 For more information on troubleshooting IIS, see [IIS Management and Administration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=255872).
