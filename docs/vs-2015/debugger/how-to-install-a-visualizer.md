# How to: Install a Visualizer
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

After you have created a visualizer, you must install the visualizer so that it will be available in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. Installing a visualizer is a simple process.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In **Store** apps, only the standard text, HTML, XML, and JSON visualizers are supported. Custom (user-created) visualizers are not supported.  
  
### To install a visualizer  
  
1. Locate the DLL that contains the visualizer you have built.  
  
2. Copy the DLL to either of the following locations:  
  
    - *VisualStudioInstallPath* `\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers`  
  
    - `My Documents\` *VisualStudioVersion* `\Visualizers`  
  
3. If you want to use a managed visualizer for remote debugging, copy the DLL to the same path on the remote computer.  
  
4. Restart the debugging session.
