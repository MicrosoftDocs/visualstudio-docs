# Native Run-Time Checks Customization
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you compile with **/RTC** (run-time checks) or use the `runtime_checks` pragma, the C run-time library provides native run-time checks. In some cases, you might want to customize run-time checking:  
  
- To route run-time check messages to a file or destination other than the default.  
  
- To specify an output destination for run-time check messages under a third-party debugger.  
  
- To report run-time check messages from a program compiled with a release version of the C run-time library. Release versions of the library do not use `_CrtDbgReportW` to report run-time errors. Instead, they display an **Assert** dialog box for each run-time error.  
  
  To customize run-time error checking, you can:  
  
- Write a run-time error reporting function. For more information, see [How to: Write a Run-Time Error Reporting Function](../debugger/how-to-write-a-run-time-error-reporting-function.md).  
  
- Customize the error message destination.  
  
- Query for information about run-time check errors.  
  
## Customize the Error Message Destination  
 If you use `_CrtDbgReportW` to report errors, you can use `_CrtSetReportMode` to specify the destination of error messages.  
  
 If you use a custom reporting function, use `_RTC_SetErrorType` to associate an error with a report type.  
  
## Query for Information About Run-Time Checks  
 `_RTC_NumErrors` returns the number of error types detected by run-time error checks. To get a brief description of each error, you can loop from 0 to the return value of `_RTC_NumErrors`, passing the iteration value to `_RTC_GetErrDesc` on each loop. For more information, see [_RTC_NumErrors](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7e82adae-38e2-4f8b-bc0b-37bda8109fd1) and [_RTC_GetErrDesc](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7994ec2b-5488-4fd4-806d-a166c9a9f927).
