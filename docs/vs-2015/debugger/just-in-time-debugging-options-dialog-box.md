# Just-In-Time, Debugging, Options Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To access the **Just-In-Time** page, go to the **Tools** menu and click **Options**. In the **Options** dialog box, expand the **Debugging** node and select **Just-In-Time**. This page allows you to enable Just-In-Time debugging for managed code, native code, and script. For more information, see [Just-In-Time Debugging](../debugger/just-in-time-debugging-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
 You can enable Just-In-Time debugging for these program types:  
  
- Managed  
  
- Native  
  
- Script  
  
  Just-In-Time debugging is a technique for debugging a program that is started outside [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. You can run a program created in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] outside of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] environment. If you have enabled Just-in-time debugging, a crash will display a dialog box that asks if you want to debug.  
  
## Associated Warnings  
 When you visit this page of the **Options** dialog box, you might see a warning message like this:  
  
 **Another debugger has registered itself as the Just-In-Time debugger. To repair, enable Just-In-Time debugging or run Visual Studio repair.**  
  
 This message occurs if you have another debugger, possibly an older version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] debugger, set as the Just-In-Time debugger.  
  
 Another message that you might see is as follows:  
  
 **Just-In-Time debugging registration errors detected. To repair, enable Just-In-Time debugging or run Visual Studio repair.**  
  
 If you see either of these warnings, Just-In-Time debugging with [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)] requires Administrator privileges until you have fixed the problem. If you try to enable just-as a non-administrator under these conditions, you will see the following error message:  
  
 **Access is denied. Have an administrator enable Just-In-Time debugging, or repair your installation of Visual Studio.**
