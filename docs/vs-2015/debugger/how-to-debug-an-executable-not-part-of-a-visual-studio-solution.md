# How to: Debug an Executable Not Part of a Visual Studio Solution
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Sometimes, you may want to debug an executable that is not part of a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project. It may be an executable you created outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] or an executable you received from someone else.  
  
 The usual answer to this problem is to start the executable outside of Visual Studio and attach to it using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] debugger. For more information, see[Attach to Running Processes](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).  
  
 Attaching to an application requires some manual steps, so it takes a few seconds. This slight delay means that attaching will not help if you are trying to debug a problem that occurs during startup. Also, if you are debugging a program that does not wait for user input and finishes quickly, you may not have time to attach to it. If you have [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../includes/vcprvc-md.md)] installed, you can create an EXE project for such a program.  
  
### To create an EXE project for an existing executable  
  
1. On the **File** menu, click **Open** and select **Project**.  
  
2. In the **Open Project** dialog box, click the drop-down list next to the **File name** box, and select **All Project Files**.  
  
3. Locate the executable, and click **OK**.  
  
     This creates a temporary solution that contains the executable.  
  
### To import an executable into a Visual Studio solution  
  
1. On the **File** menu, point to **Add Project**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
2. In the **Add Existing Project** dialog box, click the drop-down list next to the **File name** box, and select **All Project Files**.  
  
3. Locate and select the executable.  
  
4. Click **OK**.  
  
5. Start the executable by choosing an execution command, such as **Start**, from the **Debug** menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all programming languages support EXE projects. Install [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../includes/vcprvc-md.md)] if you need to use this feature.  
  
     When you are debugging an executable without the source code, the available debugging features are limited, whether you attach to a running executable or add the executable to a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] solution. If the executable was built without debug information in a compatible format, available features are further limited. If you have the source code, the best approach is to import the source code into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and create a debug build of the executable in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].
