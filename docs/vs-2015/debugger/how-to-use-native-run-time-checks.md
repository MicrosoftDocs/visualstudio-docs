# How to: Use Native Run-Time Checks
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In Visual C++, you can use native [runtime_checks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ae50b43f-f88d-47ad-a2db-3389e9e7df5b) to catch common run-time errors such as:  
  
- Stack pointer corruption.  
  
- Overruns of local arrays.  
  
- Stack corruption.  
  
- Dependencies on uninitialized local variables.  
  
- Loss of data on an assignment to a shorter variable.  
  
  If you use **/RTC** with an optimized (**/O**) build, a compiler error results. If you use a `runtime_checks` pragma in an optimized build, the pragma has no effect.  
  
  When you debug a program that has run-time checks enabled, the default action is for the program to stop and break to the debugger when a run-time error occurs. You can change this default behavior for any run-time check. For more information, see [Managing Exceptions with the Debugger](../debugger/managing-exceptions-with-the-debugger.md).  
  
  The following procedures describe how to enable native run-time checks in a debug build, and how to modify native run-time check behavior.  
  
  Other topics in this section provide information about:  
  
- [Customizing Run-Time Checks with the C Run-Time Library](../debugger/native-run-time-checks-customization.md)  
  
- [Using Run-Time Checks without the C Run-Time Library](../debugger/using-run-time-checks-without-the-c-run-time-library.md)  
  
### To enable native run-time checks in a debug build  
  
- Use the **/RTC** option and link with the debug version of a C run-time library (/MDd, for example).  
  
### To modify native run-time check behavior  
  
- Use the `runtime_checks` pragma.
