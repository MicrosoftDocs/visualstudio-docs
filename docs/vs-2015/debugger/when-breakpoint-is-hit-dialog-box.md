# When Breakpoint Is Hit Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

With this dialog box, you can customize the action that occurs when a breakpoint is hit.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **Print a Message**  
 Prints a message, using DebuggerDisplay syntax. For more information, see [Using the DebuggerDisplay Attribute](../debugger/using-the-debuggerdisplay-attribute.md).  
  
 This textbox also supports special keywords (such as $ADDRESS) that can be used by themselves or within the curly braces of a DebuggerDisplay expression. The available keywords are listed on the dialog box.  
  
 **Continue Execution**  
 This control is enabled only when **Print a Message** is selected. With this control selected, you can use a breakpoint as a tracepoint to trace your program execution, rather than breaking when the location is hit.
