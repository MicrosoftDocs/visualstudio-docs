# Cannot Change Value Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Error  
 `The value of this variable cannot be changed` &#124; `The name` *name* `does not exist in the current context` &#124; *various other messages*  
  
 This message box appears when you try to change the contents of a variable to an illegal value in a debugger window (Autos, Watch, or Locals windows) or in the QuickWatch dialog box. For example, if you try to set the value of an integer variable to a character string, this message box appears.  
  
## Solution  
 Make sure the input you type into the debugger window or QuickWatch dialog box represents a legal value for the variable you are trying to set.
