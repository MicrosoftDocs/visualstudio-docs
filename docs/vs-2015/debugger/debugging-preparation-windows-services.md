# Debugging Preparation: Windows Services
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A Windows service is a program that runs in the background under Microsoft Windows. Examples include the Telnet service and the Windows time service, which updates your computer's visible clock. A Windows service cannot be run from within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]; it must run within the context of the Services Control Manager. For more information, see [Creating Windows Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0f5e2cbb-d95d-477c-b2b5-4b990e6b86ff), [Debugging Windows Service Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/63ab0800-0f05-4f1e-88e6-94c73fd920a2), and [Windows Service Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ba72d648-9553-4849-b829-069ad5ea014b).
