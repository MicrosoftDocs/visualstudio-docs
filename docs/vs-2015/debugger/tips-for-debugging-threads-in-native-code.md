# Tips for Debugging Threads in Native Code
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Here are some tips you can use when debugging threads in native code:  
  
- You can view the contents of the Thread Information Block by typing `@TIB` in the **Watch** window or **QuickWatch** dialog box.  
  
- You can view the last error code for the current thread by entering `@Err` in the **Watch** window or **QuickWatch** dialog box.  
  
- C Run-Time Libraries (CRT) functions can be useful for debugging a multithreaded application. For more information, see [_malloc_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c97eca51-140b-4461-8bd2-28965b49ecdb).
