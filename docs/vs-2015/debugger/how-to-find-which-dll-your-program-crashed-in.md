# How to: Find Which DLL Your Program Crashed In
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose Import and Export Settings on the Tools menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
 If your application crashes during a call to a system DLL or someone else's code, you need to find out which DLL was active when the crash occurred. If you experience a crash in a DLL outside your own program, you can identify the location using the **Modules** window.  
  
### To find where a crash occurred using the Modules window  
  
1. Note the address where the crash occurred.  
  
2. On the **Debug** menu, choose **Windows**, and click **Modules**.  
  
3. In the **Modules** window, find the **Address** column. You may need to use the scrollbar to see it.  
  
4. Click the **Address** button at the top of the column to sort the DLLs by address.  
  
5. Scan the sorted list to find the DLL whose address range contains the crash location.  
  
6. Look at the **Name** and **Path** columns to see the DLL name and path.
