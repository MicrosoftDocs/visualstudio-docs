# CaptureCurrentFrame
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Captures the remainder of the current frame to the graphics log file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void CaptureCurrentFrame();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 If another capture is currently in progress—such as a capture that was started by the `BeginCapture` function—then that capture is completed and recorded to the graphics log as a distinct frame. Immediately afterwards, graphics diagnostics begins capturing the remainder of the current frame, which is also recorded as a distinct frame. The current frame's end is marked by a call to present.  
  
 To capture a frame, you must prepare your app to capture and record graphics information—that is, you must have called [Init](../debugger/init.md) through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class before you call `CaptureCurrentFrame`.
