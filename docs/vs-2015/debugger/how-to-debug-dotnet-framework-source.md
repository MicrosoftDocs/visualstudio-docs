# How to: Debug .NET Framework Source
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The most recent version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] provides new features for [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] debugging. To debug [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] source, you must have access to debugging symbols for the code. You also need to enable stepping into [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] source.  
  
 You can enable [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] stepping and symbol downloading in the **Options** dialog box. When you enable symbol downloading, you can choose to download symbols immediately or just enable the option for later downloading. If you do not download the symbols immediately, symbols will be downloaded the next time that you start debugging your application. You also can do a manual download from the **Modules** window or the **Call Stack** window.  
  
### To enable .NET Framework source debugging  
  
1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2. In the **Options** dialog box, click the **Debugging** category.  
  
3. In the **General** box, set **Enable .NET Framework** source stepping.  
  
    1. If you had Just My Code enabled, a warning dialog box tells you that Just My Code is now disabled. Click **OK**.  
  
    2. If you did not have a symbol cache location set, another warning dialog box tells you that a default symbol cache location is now set. Click **OK**.  
  
4. Under the **Debugging** category, click **Symbols**.  
  
5. If you want to change the symbols cache location:  
  
    1. Open the **Debugging** node in the box on the left.  
  
    2. Under the **Debugging** node, click **Symbols**.  
  
    3. Edit the location in **Cache symbols from symbol servers to this directory** or click **Browse** to choose a location.  
  
6. If you want to download symbols immediately, click **Load Symbols using above locations**.  
  
     This button is not available in design mode.  
  
     If you do not choose to download symbols now, symbols will be downloaded automatically the next time that you start the debugging your program.  
  
7. Click **OK** to close the **Options** dialog box.  
  
### To load Framework symbols using the Modules window  
  
1. In the **Modules** window, right-click a module for which symbols are not loaded. You can tell if symbols are loaded or not by looking at the **Symbols Status** column.  
  
2. Point to **Load Symbols From** and click **Microsoft Symbol Servers** to download symbols from the Microsoft public symbols server or **Symbol Path** to load from a directory where you have previously stored symbols.  
  
### To load Framework symbols using the Call Stack window  
  
1. In the **Call Stack** window, right-click a frame for which symbols are not loaded. The frame will be dimmed out.  
  
2. Point to **Load Symbols From** and click **Microsoft Symbol Servers** or **Symbol Path**.
