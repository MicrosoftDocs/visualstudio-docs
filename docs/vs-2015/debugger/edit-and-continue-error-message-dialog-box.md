# Edit and Continue Error Message Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This dialog box appears when you are debugging in a language that supports Edit and Continue, but **Edit and Continue** is not available for the type of code changes you have made. The error message inside the box provides a more detailed explanation. Possible reasons for seeing this dialog box include:  
  
- You tried to edit managed code when unmanaged debugging was enabled. Edit and Continue does not work with mixed-mode debugging.  
  
- You tried to edit SQL Server code.  
  
- You tried to edit code while debugging a Dr. Watson dump.  
  
- You tried to edit code after an unhandled exception occurred and the option "**Unwind the call stack on unhandled exceptions**" was not selected.  
  
- You tried to edit code while debugging an embedded runtime application.  
  
- You tried to edit code in a program that you attached to rather than starting from the **Debug** menu.  
  
- You tried to edit optimized code.  
  
- You tried to edit managed code when the target is a 64-bit application. If you want to use Edit and Continue, you must set the target to x86. (*Project* **Properties**, **Compile** tab, **Advanced Compiler** setting.).  
  
- You tried to edit code in an assembly that was modified during debugging and has been reloaded.  
  
- You tried to edit code in an assembly that has not been loaded.  
  
- You started debugging an old version of your application (since the new version has build errors).  
  
- You tried to edit code while it was running.  
  
## UIElement List  
 **OK**  
 Exit the dialog box and cancel the immediately preceding edit attempt.
