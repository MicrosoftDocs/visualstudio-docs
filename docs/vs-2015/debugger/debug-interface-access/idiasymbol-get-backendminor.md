# IDiaSymbol::get_backEndMinor
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Retrieves the back end minor version number of the compiler.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT get_backEndMinor (Â   
   DWORD* pRetVal  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pRetVal`  
 [out] Returns the back end minor version number. See Remarks.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns `S_FALSE` or an error code.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> A return value of `S_FALSE` means that the property is not available for the symbol.  
  
## Remarks  
 A compiler is typically composed of two primary elements: the front end (the parser), which handles parsing the source code into an intermediate form, and a back end (code generator), which converts the intermediate form into assembly. It is not uncommon for the front end to have a different version than the back end.  
  
 A front end or back end version number is composed of three parts: \<major>.\<minor>.\<build>, where \<major> is the major version number, \<minor> is the minor version number, and \<build> is the build number. For example, 13.10.3077.
