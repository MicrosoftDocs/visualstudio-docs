# Overview (Debug Interface Access SDK)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Use the DIA SDK to access the Microsoft debug information. The DIA SDK provides a COM based API set that eliminates the need to rewrite your code whenever Microsoft changes the format of the debug information. The DIA SDK also allows you to read from a select set of previous versions of debug information, located in .pdb and .dbg files generated by [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)] versions 5.0 and later.  
  
 Each interface in the DIA SDK represents a different COM object, except where stated otherwise. Additional interfaces, and thus additional objects, are created by means of explicit queries, such as [IDiaDataSource::openSession](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiadatasource-opensession.md) or [IDiaSession::findChildren](../../debugger/debug-interface-access/idiasession-findchildren.md), rather than by calling `QueryInterface` on existing interface pointers.
