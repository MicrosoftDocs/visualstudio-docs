# How to: Switch to Another Thread While Debugging
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you debug a multithreaded application, you can use any one of several methods to switch the context from the thread that you have been working with to another thread.  
  
### To switch to any thread that appears in the Threads window  
  
- Double-click the thread.  
  
### To switch to a thread in a source window  
  
- In the left gutter, right-click a thread indicator, point to **Switch to**, and then click the name of that thread to which you want to switch. The shortcut menu shows only the threads at that specific location.  
  
     If no indicators appear, right-click in the **Threads** window and verify that **Show Threads in Source** is selected.  
  
### To switch to a thread in the Debug Location toolbar  
  
1. On the **Debug Location** toolbar, click the **Thread** box.  
  
2. In the list, click the thread to which you want to switch.
