# Publishing ClickOnce Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application for the first time, publish properties can be set using the Publish Wizard. Only a few of the properties are available in the wizard; all other properties are set to their default values.  
  
 Subsequent changes to publish properties are made on the **Publish** page in the **Project Designer**.  
  
## Publish Wizard  
 You can use the Publish Wizard to set the basic settings for publishing your application. This includes the following publishing properties:  
  
- Publishing Folder Location - where Visual Studio will copy the files (local computer, network file share, FTP server, or Web site)  
  
- Installation Folder Location - where end users will install from (network file share, FTP server, Web site, CD/DVD)  
  
- Online or Offline availability - if end users can access the application with or without a network connection  
  
- Update frequency - how often the application checks for new updates.  
  
  For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce Application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).  
  
## Publish Page  
 The **Publish** page of the **Project Designer** is used to configure properties for ClickOnce deployment. The following table lists topics  
  
|Title|Description|

|[How to: Specify Where Visual Studio Copies the Files](../deployment/how-to-specify-where-visual-studio-copies-the-files.md)|Describes how to set where Visual Studio puts the application files and manifests.|  
|[How to: Specify the Location Where End Users Will Install From](../deployment/how-to-specify-the-location-where-end-users-will-install-from.md)|Describes how to set the location where users go to download and install the application.|  
|[How to: Specify the ClickOnce Offline or Online Install Mode](../deployment/how-to-specify-the-clickonce-offline-or-online-install-mode.md)|Describes how to set whether the application will be available offline or online.|  
|[How to: Set the ClickOnce Publish Version](../deployment/how-to-set-the-clickonce-publish-version.md)|Describes how to set the ClickOnce **Publish Version** property, which determines whether or not the application that you are publishing will be treated as an update.|

 For more information, see [Publish Page, Project Designer](../ide/reference/publish-page-project-designer.md)  
  
### Application Files Dialog Box  
 This dialog box allows you to specify how the files in your project are categorized for publishing, dynamic downloading, and updating. It contains a grid that lists the project files that are not excluded by default, or that have a download group.  
  
 To exclude files, mark files as data files or prerequisites, and create groups of files for conditional installation in the Visual Studio UI, see [How to: Specify Which Files Are Published by ClickOnce](../deployment/how-to-specify-which-files-are-published-by-clickonce.md). You can also mark data files by using the Mage.exe. For more information, see [How to: Include a Data File in a ClickOnce Application](../deployment/how-to-include-a-data-file-in-a-clickonce-application.md).  
  
### Prerequisites Dialog Box  
 This dialog box specifies which prerequisite components are installed, as well as how they are installed. For more information, see [How to: Install Prerequisites with a ClickOnce Application](../deployment/how-to-install-prerequisites-with-a-clickonce-application.md) and [Prerequisites Dialog Box](../ide/reference/prerequisites-dialog-box.md).  
  
### Application Updates Dialog Box  
 This dialog box specifies how the application installation should check for updates. For more information, see [How to: Manage Updates for a ClickOnce Application](../deployment/how-to-manage-updates-for-a-clickonce-application.md).  
  
### Publish Options Dialog Box  
 The Publish Options dialog box specifies an application's deployment options.
