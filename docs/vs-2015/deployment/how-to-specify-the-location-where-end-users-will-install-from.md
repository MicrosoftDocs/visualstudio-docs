# How to: Specify the Location Where End Users Will Install From
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When publishing a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application, the location where users go to download and install the application is not necessarily the location where you initially publish the application. For example, in some organizations a developer might publish an application to a staging server, and then an administrator would move the application to a Web server.  
  
 In this case, you can use the `Installation URL` property to specify the Web server where users will go to download the application. This is necessary so that the application manifest knows where to look for updates.  
  
 The `Installation URL` property can be set on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
 **Note** The `Installation URL` property can also be set using the **PublishWizard**. For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce Application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).  
  
### To specify an Installation URL  
  
1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
2. Click the **Publish** tab.  
  
3. In the Installation URL field, enter the installation location using a fully qualified URL using the format https://www.microsoft.com/ApplicationName, or a UNC path using the format \\\Server\ApplicationName.
