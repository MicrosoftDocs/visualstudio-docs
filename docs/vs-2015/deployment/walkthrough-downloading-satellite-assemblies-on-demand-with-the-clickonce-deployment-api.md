# Walkthrough: Downloading Satellite Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Windows Forms applications can be configured for multiple cultures through the use of satellite assemblies. A *satellite assembly* is an assembly that contains application resources for a culture other than the application's default culture.  
  
 As discussed in [Localizing ClickOnce Applications](../deployment/localizing-clickonce-applications.md), you can include multiple satellite assemblies for multiple cultures within the same [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] will download all of the satellite assemblies in your deployment to the client machine, although a single client will probably require only one satellite assembly.  
  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how to mark your satellite assemblies as optional, and download only the assembly a client machine needs for its current culture settings. The following procedure uses the tools available in the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../includes/winsdklong-md.md)]. You can also perform this task in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  Also see [Walkthrough: Downloading Satellite Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API Using the Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms366788\(v=vs.110\)) or [Walkthrough: Downloading Satellite Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API Using the Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms366788\(v=vs.120\)).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> For testing purposes, the following code example programmatically sets the culture to `ja-JP`. See the "Next Steps" section later in this topic for information on how to adjust this code for a production environment.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 This topic assumes that you know how to add localized resources to your application using Visual Studio. For detailed instructions, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/y99d1cd3\(v=vs.100\).aspx).  
  
### To download satellite assemblies on demand  
  
1. Add the following code to your application to enable on-demand downloading of satellite assemblies.  
  
     [!code-csharp[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK/CS/Program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK#1](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesSDK/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
2. Generate satellite assemblies for your application by using [Resgen.exe (Resource File Generator)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ef159de-b660-4bec-9213-c3fbc4d1c6f4) or [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
3. Generate an application manifest, or open your existing application manifest, by using MageUI.exe. For more information about this tool, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f9e130a6-8117-49c4-839c-c988f641dc14).  
  
4. Click the **Files** tab.  
  
5. Click the **ellipsis** button (**...**) and select the directory containing all of your application's assemblies and files, including the satellite assemblies you generated using Resgen.exe. (A satellite assembly will have a name in the form *isoCode*\ApplicationName.resources.dll, where *isoCode* is a language identifier in RFC 1766 format.)  
  
6. Click **Populate** to add the files to your deployment.  
  
7. Select the **Optional** check box for each satellite assembly.  
  
8. Set the group field for each satellite assembly to its ISO language identifier. For example, for a Japanese satellite assembly, you would specify a download group name of `ja-JP`. This will enable the code you added in step 1 to download the appropriate satellite assembly, depending upon the user's <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property setting.  
  
## Next Steps  
 In a production environment, you will likely need to remove the line in the code example that sets <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> to a specific value, because client machines will have the correct value set by default. When your application runs on a Japanese client machine, for example, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> will be `ja-JP` by default. Setting this value programmatically is a good way to test your satellite assemblies before you deploy your application.
