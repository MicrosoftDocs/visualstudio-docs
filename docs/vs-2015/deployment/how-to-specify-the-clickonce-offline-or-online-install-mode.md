# How to: Specify the ClickOnce Offline or Online Install Mode
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The `Install Mode` for a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application determines whether the application will be available offline or online. When you choose **The application is available online only**, the user must have access to the [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] publishing location (either a Web page or a file share) in order to run the application. When you choose **The application is available offline as well**, the application adds entries to the **Start** menu and the **Add or Remove Programs** dialog box; the user is able to run the application when they are not connected.  
  
 The `Install Mode` can be set on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
 **Note** The `Install Mode` can also be set using the Publish wizard. For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce Application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).  
  
### To make a ClickOnce application available online only  
  
1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
2. Click the **Publish** tab.  
  
3. In the **Install Mode and Settings** area, click the **The application is available online only** option button.
