# Walkthrough: Downloading Satellite Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API Using the Designer

[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Windows Forms applications can be configured for multiple cultures through the use of satellite assemblies. A *satellite assembly* is an assembly that contains application resources for a culture other than the application's default culture.

As discussed in [Localizing ClickOnce Applications](../deployment/localizing-clickonce-applications.md), you can include multiple satellite assemblies for multiple cultures within the same [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] deployment. By default, [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] will download all of the satellite assemblies in your deployment to the client machine, although a single client will probably require only one satellite assembly.

This walkthrough demonstrates how to mark your satellite assemblies as optional, and download only the assembly a client machine needs for its current culture settings.

> [!NOTE]
> For testing purposes, the following code examples programmatically set the culture to `ja-JP`. See the "Next Steps" section later in this topic for information on how to adjust this code for a production environment.

### To mark satellite assemblies as optional

1. Build your project. This will generate satellite assemblies for all of the cultures you are localizing to.

2. Right-click on your project name in Solution Explorer, and click **Properties**.

3. Click the **Publish** tab, and then click **Application Files**.

4. Select the **Show all files** check box to display satellite assemblies. By default, all satellite assemblies will be included in your deployment and will be visible in this dialog box.

     A satellite assembly will have a name in the form *isoCode*\ApplicationName.resources.dll, where *isoCode* is a language identifier in RFC 1766 format.

5. Click **New...** in the **Download Group** list for each language identifier. When prompted for a download group name, enter the language identifier. For example, for a Japanese satellite assembly, you would specify the download group name `ja-JP`.

6. Close the **Application Files** dialog box.

### To download satellite assemblies on demand in C\#

1. Open the Program.cs file. If you do not see this file in Solution Explorer, select your project, and on the **Project** menu, click **Show All Files**.

2. Use the following code to download the appropriate satellite assembly and start your application.

     [!code-csharp[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssemblies#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssemblies/CS/Program.cs#1)]

### To download satellite assemblies on demand in Visual Basic

1. In the **Properties** window for the application, click the **Application** tab.

2. At the bottom of the tab page, click **View Application Events**.

3. Add the following imports to the beginning of the ApplicationEvents.VB file.

     [!code-vb[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#1](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB/VB/ApplicationEvents.vb#1)]

4. Add the following code to the `MyApplication` class.

     [!code-vb[ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB#2](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ClickOnce.SatelliteAssembliesVB/VB/ApplicationEvents.vb#2)]

## Next Steps

In a production environment, you will likely need to remove the line in the code examples that sets <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> to a specific value, because client machines will have the correct value set by default. When your application runs on a Japanese client machine, for example, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> will be `ja-JP` by default. Setting it programmatically is a good way to test your satellite assemblies before you deploy your application.
