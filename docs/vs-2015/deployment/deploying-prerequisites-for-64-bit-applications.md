# Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

ClickOnce deployment supports the installation of applications on 64-bit platforms. The target platforms are **x86** for 32-bit platforms, **x64** for machines supporting the AMD64 and EM64T instruction sets, and **Itanium** for the 64-bit Itanium processor.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 The following table lists the redistributables that you can use as prerequisites for your 64-bit application's installation.  
  
 If you select a prerequisite that does not have 64-bit components, you may see a warning stating that the selected packages are not available for the 64-bit platform.  
  
|Redistributable|x64 support|IA64 support|  
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](../includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)]|Yes|No|  
|Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Libraries (IA64)|No|Yes|
