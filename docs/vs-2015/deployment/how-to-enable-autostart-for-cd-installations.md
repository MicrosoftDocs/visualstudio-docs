# How to: Enable AutoStart for CD Installations
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When deploying a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application by means of removable media such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can enable `AutoStart` so that the [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application is automatically launched when the media is inserted.  
  
 `AutoStart` can be enabled on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
### To enable AutoStart  
  
1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu click **Properties**.  
  
2. Click the **Publish** tab.  
  
3. Click the **Options** button.  
  
     The **Publish Options** dialog box appears.  
  
4. Click **Deployment**.  
  
5. Select the **For CD installations, automatically start Setup when CD is inserted** check box.  
  
     An Autorun.inf file will be copied to the publish location when the application is published.
