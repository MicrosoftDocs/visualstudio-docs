# How to: Specify a Start Menu Name for a ClickOnce Application
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application is installed for both online and offline use, an entry is added to the **Start** menu and the **Add or Remove Programs** list. By default, the display name is the same as the name of the application assembly, but you can change the display name by setting **Product name** in the **Publish Options** dialog box.  
  
 **Product name** will be displayed on the publish.htm page; for an installed offline application, it will be the name of the entry in the **Start** menu, and it will also be the name that shows in **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
 **Publisher name** will appear on the publish.htm page above **Product name**, and for an installed offline application, it will also be the name of the folder that contains the application's icon in the **Start** menu.  
  
 You can set the **Product name** and **Publisher name** properties in the **Publish Options** dialog box, available on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
### To specify a Start menu name  
  
1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.  
  
2. Click the **Publish** tab.  
  
3. Click the **Options** button to open the **Publish Options** dialog box.  
  
4. Click **Description**.  
  
5. In the **Publish Options** dialog box, enter the name to display in **Product name**.  
  
6. Optionally, you can enter a publisher name in **Publisher name**.
