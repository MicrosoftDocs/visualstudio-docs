# How to: Specify Where Visual Studio Copies the Files
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you publish an application by using ClickOnce, the `Publish Location` property specifies the location where the application files and manifest are put. This can be a file path or the path to an FTP server.

 You can specify the `Publish Location` property on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**, or by using the Publish Wizard. For more information, see [How to: Publish a ClickOnce Application using the Publish Wizard](../deployment/how-to-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-the-publish-wizard.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you install more than one version of an application by using ClickOnce, the installation moves earlier versions of the application into a folder named Archive, in the publish location that you specify. Archiving earlier versions in this manner keeps the installation directory clear of folders from the earlier version.

### To specify a publishing location

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Publish** tab.

3. In the **Publish Location** field, enter the publishing location by using one of the following formats:

   - To publish to a file share or disk path, enter the path by using either a UNC path (\\\Server\ApplicationName) or a file path (C:\Deploy\ApplicationName).

   - To publish to an FTP server, enter the path using the format ftp:\//ftp.microsoft.com/ApplicationName.

     Note that text must be present in the **Publishing Location** box in order for the Browse (**...**) button to work.
