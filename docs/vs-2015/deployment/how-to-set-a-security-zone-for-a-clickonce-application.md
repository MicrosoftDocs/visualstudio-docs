# How to: Set a Security Zone for a ClickOnce Application
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When setting code access security permissions for a ClickOnce application, you need to start with a base set of permissions on the **Security** page of the **Project Designer**.  
  
 In most cases, you can also choose the **Internet** zone which contains a limited set of permissions, or the **Local Intranet** zone which contains a greater set of permissions. If your application requires custom permissions, you can do so by choosing the **Custom** security zone. For more information about setting custom permissions, see [How to: Set Custom Permissions for a ClickOnce Application](../deployment/how-to-set-custom-permissions-for-a-clickonce-application.md).  
  
### To set a security zone  
  
1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu click **Properties**.  
  
2. Click the **Security** tab.  
  
3. Select the **Enable ClickOnce Security Settings** check box.  
  
4. Select the **This is a partial trust application** option button.  
  
     The controls in the **ClickOnce security permissions** section are enabled.  
  
5. In the **Zone your application will be installed from** drop-down list, select a security zone.
