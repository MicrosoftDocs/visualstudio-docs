# How to: Build Specific Targets in Solutions By Using MSBuild.exe
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can use MSBuild.exe to build specific targets of specific projects in a solution.  
  
### To build a specific target of a specific project in a solution  
  
1. At the command line, type `MSBuild.exe <SolutionName>.sln`, where `<SolutionName>` corresponds to the file name of the solution that contains the target that you want to execute.  
  
2. Specify the target after the **/t** switch in the format *ProjectName*:*TargetName*.  
  
## Example  
 The following example executes the `Rebuild` target of the `NotInSlnFolder` project, and then executes the `Clean` target of the `InSolutionFolder` project, which is located in the `NewFolder` solution folder.  
  
```  
msbuild SlnFolders.sln /t:NotInSlnfolder:Rebuild;NewFolder\InSolutionFolder:Clean  
```
