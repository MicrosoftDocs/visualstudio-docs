# GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly Task
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly> task generates an assembly if at least one [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] page in a project references a type that is declared locally in that project. The generated assembly is removed after the build process is completed, or if the build process fails.  
  
## Task Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`AssemblyName`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the short name of the assembly that is generated for a project and is also the name of the target assembly that is temporarily generated. For example, if a project generates a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] executable whose name is **WinExeAssembly.exe**, the **AssemblyName** parameter has a value of **WinExeAssembly**.|  
|`CompileTargetName`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the name of the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] target that is used to generate assemblies from source code files. The typical value for **CompileTargetName** is **CoreCompile**.|  
|`CompileTypeName`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the type of compilation that is performed by the target that is specified by the **CompileTargetName** parameter. For the **CoreCompile** target, this value is **Compile**.|  
|`CurrentProject`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the full path of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] project file for the project that requires a temporary target assembly.|  
|`GeneratedCodeFiles`|Optional **ITaskItem[]** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the list of language-specific managed code files that were generated by the [MarkupCompilePass1](../msbuild/markupcompilepass1-task.md) task.|  
|`IntermediateOutputPath`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the directory that the temporary target assembly is generated to.|  
|`MSBuildBinPath`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the location of **MSBuild.exe**, which is required to compile the temporary target assembly.|  
|`ReferencePath`|Optional **ITaskItem[]** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies a list of assemblies, by path and file name, that are referenced by the types that are compiled into the temporary target assembly.|  
|`ReferencePathTypeName`|Required **String** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the parameter that is used by the compilation target (**CompileTargetName**) parameter that specifies the list of assembly references (**ReferencePath**). The appropriate value is **ReferencePath**.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The first markup compilation pass, which is run by the [MarkupCompilePass1](../msbuild/markupcompilepass1-task.md), compiles [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files to binary format. Consequently, the compiler needs a list of the referenced assemblies that contain the types that are used by the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files. However, if a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] file uses a type that is defined in the same project, a corresponding assembly for that project is not created until the project is built. Therefore, an assembly reference cannot be provided during the first markup compilation pass.  
  
 Instead, **MarkupCompilePass1** defers the conversion of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files that contain references to types in the same project to a second markup compilation pass, which is executed by the [MarkupCompilePass2](../msbuild/markupcompilepass2-task.md). Before **MarkupCompilePass2** is executed, a temporary assembly is generated. This assembly contains the types that are used by the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files whose markup compilation pass was deferred. A reference to the generated assembly is provided to **MarkupCompilePass2** when it runs to allow the deferred compilation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files to be converted to binary format.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates a temporary assembly because `Page1.xaml` contains a reference to a type that is in the same project.  
  
```  
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <UsingTask  
    TaskName="Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly"   
    AssemblyFile="C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0\PresentationBuildTasks.dll" />  
  <Target Name="GenerateTemporaryTargetAssemblyTask">  
    <GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly  
      AssemblyName="WPFMSBuildSample"  
      CompileTargetName="CoreCompile"  
      CompileTypeName="Compile"  
      CurrentProject="FullBuild.proj"  
      GeneratedCodeFiles="obj\debug\app.g.cs;obj\debug\Page1.g.cs;obj\debug\Page2.g.cs"  
      ReferencePath="c:\windows\Microsoft.net\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.dll;C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WinFx\v3.0\PresentationCore.dll;C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WinFx\v3.0\PresentationFramework.dll;C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\WinFx\v3.0\WindowsBase.dll"  
      IntermediateOutputPath=".\obj\debug\"  
      MSBuildBinPath="$(MSBuildBinPath)"  
      ReferencePathTypeName="ReferencePath"/>  
  </Target>  
</Project>  
```
