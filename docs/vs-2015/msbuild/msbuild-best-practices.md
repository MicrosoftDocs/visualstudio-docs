# MSBuild Best Practices
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

We recommend the following best practices for writing MSBuild scripts:  
  
- Default property values are best handled by using the `Condition` attribute, and not by declaring a property whose default value can be overridden on the command line. For example, use  
  
     `<MyProperty Condition="$(MyProperty)" == ''>`  
  
     `MyDefaultValue`  
  
     `</MyProperty>`  
  
- Avoid wildcards when you select items. Instead, specify files explicitly. This makes it easier to track down errors that may occur when you add or delete files.
