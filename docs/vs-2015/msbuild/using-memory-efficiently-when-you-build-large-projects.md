# Using Memory Efficiently When You Build Large Projects
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Large projects often contain many sub-projects and other dependencies, and these may consume lots of system memory at build time. When available system memory is decreased, system performance may also be decreased. Older versions of [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] projects remained in memory or, in version 3.5 the projects were removed, but it retained build results in a cache for later retrieval.  
  
 Version 4.0 handles this memory management automatically, saving projects from having to use properties such as  `UnloadProjectsOnCompletion` and `UseResultsCache`.
