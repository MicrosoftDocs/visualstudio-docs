# How to: Escape Special Characters in MSBuild
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Certain characters have special meaning in [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] project files. Examples of the characters include semicolons (;) and asterisks (*). For a complete list of these special characters, see [MSBuild Special Characters](../msbuild/msbuild-special-characters.md).  
  
 In order to use these special characters as literals in a project file, they must be specified by using the syntax %*xx*, where *xx* represents the ASCII hexadecimal value of the character.  
  
## MSBuild Special Characters  
 One example of where special characters are used is in the `Include` attribute of item lists. For example, the following item list declares two items: `MyFile.cs` and `MyClass.cs`.  
  
```  
<Compile Include="MyFile.cs;MyClass.cs"/>  
```  
  
 If you want to declare an item that contains a semicolon in the name, you must use the %*xx* syntax to escape the semicolon and prevent [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] from declaring two separate items. For example, the following item escapes the semicolon and declares one item named `MyFile.cs;MyClass.cs`.  
  
```  
<Compile Include="MyFile.cs%3BMyClass.cs"/>  
```  
  
#### To use an MSBuild special character as a literal character  
  
- Use the notation %*xx* in place of the special character, where *xx* represents the hexadecimal value of the ASCII character. For example, to use an asterisk (*) as a literal character, use the value `%2A`.
