# How to: Select the Files to Build
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you build a project that contains several files, you can list each file separately in the project file, or you can use wildcards to include all the files in one directory or a nested set of directories.  
  
## Specifying Inputs  
 Items represent the inputs for a build. For more information on items, see [Items](../msbuild/msbuild-items.md).  
  
 To include files for a build, they must be included in an item list in the [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] project file. Multiple files can be added to item lists by either including the files individually or using wildcards to include many files at once.  
  
#### To declare items individually  
  
- Use the `Include` attributes similar to following:  
  
     `<CSFile Include="form1.cs"/>`  
  
     – or –  
  
     `<VBFile Include="form1.vb"/>`  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If items in an item collection are not in the same directory as the project file, you must specify the full or relative path to the item. For example: `Include="..\..\form2.cs"`.  
  
#### To declare multiple items  
  
- Use the `Include` attributes similar to following:  
  
     `<CSFile Include="form1.cs;form2.cs"/>`  
  
     – or –  
  
     `<VBFile Include="form1.vb;form2.vb"/>`  
  
## Specifying Inputs with Wildcards  
 You can also use wildcards to recursively include all files or only specific files from subdirectories as inputs for a build. For more information about wildcards, see [Items](../msbuild/msbuild-items.md)  
  
 The following examples are based on a project that contains graphics files in the following directories and subdirectories, with the project file located in the Project directory:  
  
 Project\Images\BestJpgs  
  
 Project\Images\ImgJpgs  
  
 Project\Images\ImgJpgs\Img1  
  
#### To include all .jpg files in the Images directory and subdirectories  
  
- Use the following `Include` attribute:  
  
     `Include="Images\**\*.jpg"`  
  
#### To include all .jpg files starting with "img"  
  
- Use the following `Include` attribute:  
  
     `Include="Images\**\img*.jpg"`  
  
#### To include all files in directories with names ending in "jpgs"  
  
- Use one of the following `Include` attributes:  
  
     `Include="Images\**\*jpgs\*.*"`  
  
     – or –  
  
     `Include="Images\**\*jpgs\*"`  
  
## Passing Items to a Task  
 In a project file, you can use the @() notation in tasks to specify an entire item list as the input for a build. You can use this notation whether you list all files separately or use wildcards.  
  
#### To use all Visual C# or Visual Basic files as inputs  
  
- Use the `Include` attributes similar to the following:  
  
     `<CSC Sources="@(CSFile)">...</CSC>`  
  
     – or –  
  
     `<VBC Sources="@(VBFile)">...</VBC>`  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must use wildcards with items to specifiy the inputs for a build; you cannot specify the inputs using the `Sources` attribute in [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)] tasks such as [Csc](../msbuild/csc-task.md) or [Vbc](../msbuild/vbc-task.md). The following example is not valid in a project file:  
>   
> `<CSC Sources="*.cs">...</CSC>`  
  
## Example  
 The following code example shows a project that includes all of the input files separately.  
  
```  
<Project DefaultTargets="Compile"  
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003" >  
    <PropertyGroup>  
        <Builtdir>built</Builtdir>  
    </PropertyGroup>  
  
    <ItemGroup>  
        <CSFile Include="Form1.cs"/>  
        <CSFile Include="AssemblyInfo.cs"/>  
  
        <Reference Include="System.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Data.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Drawing.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Windows.Forms.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.XML.dll"/>  
    </ItemGroup>  
  
    <Target Name="PreBuild">  
        <Exec Command="if not exist $(builtdir) md $(builtdir)"/>  
    </Target>  
  
    <Target Name="Compile" DependsOnTargets="PreBuild">  
        <Csc Sources="@(CSFile)"  
            References="@(Reference)"  
            OutputAssembly="$(builtdir)\$(MSBuildProjectName).exe"  
            TargetType="exe" />  
    </Target>  
</Project>  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following code example uses a wildcard to include all the .cs files.  
  
```  
<Project DefaultTargets="Compile"  
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003" >  
  
    <PropertyGroup>  
        <builtdir>built</builtdir>  
    </PropertyGroup>  
  
    <ItemGroup>  
        <CSFile Include="*.cs"/>  
  
        <Reference Include="System.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Data.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Drawing.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.Windows.Forms.dll"/>  
        <Reference Include="System.XML.dll"/>  
    </ItemGroup>  
  
    <Target Name="PreBuild">  
        <Exec Command="if not exist $(builtdir) md $(builtdir)"/>  
    </Target>  
  
    <Target Name="Compile" DependsOnTargets="PreBuild">  
        <Csc Sources="@(CSFile)"  
            References="@(Reference)"  
            OutputAssembly="$(builtdir)\$(MSBuildProjectName).exe"  
            TargetType="exe" />  
    </Target>  
</Project>  
```
