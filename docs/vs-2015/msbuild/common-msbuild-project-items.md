# Common MSBuild Project Items
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../includes/vstecmsbuild-md.md)], an item is a named reference to one or more files. Items contain metadata such as file names, paths, and version numbers. All project types in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] have several items in common. These items are defined in the file microsoft.build.commontypes.xsd.  
  
## Common Items  
 The following is a list of all the common project items.  
  
### Reference  
 Represents an assembly (managed) reference in the project.  
  
|Item Name|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|HintPath|Optional string. Relative or absolute path of the assembly.|  
|Name|Optional string. The display name of the assembly, for example, "System.Windows.Forms."|  
|FusionName|Optional string. Specifies the simple or strong fusion name for the item.<br /><br /> When this attribute is present, it can save time because the assembly file does not have to be opened to obtain the fusion name.|  
|SpecificVersion|Optional boolean. Specifies whether only the version in the fusion name should be referenced.|  
|Aliases|Optional string. Any aliases for the reference.|  
|Private|Optional boolean. Specifies whether the reference should be copied to the output folder. This attribute matches the **Copy Local** property of the reference that's in the Visual Studio IDE.|  
  
### COMReference  
 Represents a COM (unmanaged) component reference in the project.  
  
|Item Name|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Name|Optional string. The display name of the component.|  
|Guid|Optional string. A GUID for the component, in the form {12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567891234}.|  
|VersionMajor|Optional string. The major part of the version number of the component. For example, "5" if the full version number is "5.46."|  
|VersionMinor|Optional string. The minor part of the version number of the component. For example, "46" if the full version number is "5.46."|  
|LCID|Optional string. The LocaleID for the component.|  
|WrapperTool|Optional string. The name of the wrapper tool that is used on the component, for example, "tlbimp."|  
|Isolated|Optional boolean. Specifies whether the component is a reg-free component.|  
  
### COMFileReference  
 Represents a list of type libraries that feed into the ResolvedComreference target.  
  
|Item Name|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|WrapperTool|Optional string. The name of the wrapper tool that is used on the component, for example, "tlbimp."|  
  
### NativeReference  
 Represents a native manifest file or a reference to such a file.  
  
|Item Name|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Name|Required string. The base name of the manifest file.|  
|HintPath|Required string. The relative path of the manifest file.|  
  
### ProjectReference  
 Represents a reference to another project.  
  
|Item Name|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Name|Optional string. The display name of the reference.|  
|Project|Optional string. A GUID for the reference, in the form {12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567891234}.|  
|Package|Optional string. The path of the project file that is being referenced.|
