# Context Menus
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Context menus are displayed when a user right-clicks in an active region of the client area and clear when the right mouse button is released.  
  
## Editor Context Menus  
 By intercepting `ECMD_SHOWCONTEXTMENU`, your language service can control the context menus that will display in the editor. To display your own context menu, handle this command when it is passed into your <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleCommandTarget> by calling <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsUIShell.ShowContextMenu%2A>. If you do not handle this command, then the IDE displays a standard context menu provided for the editor. You can also control the content of the context menu on a per-marker basis. For more information about this, see [Using Text Markers with the Legacy API](../extensibility/using-text-markers-with-the-legacy-api.md) and [Intercepting Legacy Language Service Commands](../extensibility/internals/intercepting-legacy-language-service-commands.md).
