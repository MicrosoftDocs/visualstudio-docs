# Accessing Text Layers by Using the Legacy API
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A text layer typically encapsulates some aspect of text layout. For example, a "function-at-a-time" layer hides text before and after a function containing the caret (text insertion point).  
  
 A text layer resides between a buffer and a view, and it modifies the way the view sees the buffer's contents.  
  
## Text Layer Information  
 The following list describes how text layers work in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]:  
  
- The text in a text layer can be adorned with syntax coloring and markers.  
  
- You currently cannot implement your own layers.  
  
- A layer exposes <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLayer>, which is derived from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLines>. The text buffer itself is also implemented as a layer, which enables a view to deal polymorphically with underlying layers.  
  
- Any number of layers may lie between the view and the buffer. Each layer deals only with the layer below it, and the view deals largely with the top-most layer. (The view does have some information about the buffer.)  
  
- A layer can affect only layers that are below it. It cannot affect the layers above it beyond originating standard events.  
  
- In the editor, hidden text, synthetic text, and word wrap are implemented as layers. You can implement hidden and synthetic text without interacting directly with the layers. For more information, see [Outlining in a Legacy Language Service](../extensibility/internals/outlining-in-a-legacy-language-service.md) and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsSyntheticTextSession>.  
  
- Each text layer has its own local coordinate system that is exposed through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLayer> interface. The line-wrap layer, for example, might contain two lines while the underlying text buffer might contain only one line.  
  
- The view communicates to layers through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsLayeredTextView> interface. Use this interface to reconcile view coordinates with buffer coordinates.  
  
- Any layer such as the synthetic text layer that originates text must provide a local implementation of <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLayer.CreateTrackingPoint%2A>.  
  
- Besides <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLayer>, a text layer must implement <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IConnectionPointContainer> and fire the events in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsTextLinesEvents> interface.
