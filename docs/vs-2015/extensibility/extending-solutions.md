# Extending Solutions
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A solution is a grouping of one or more projects that work together to create an application.  
  
## In This Section  
 The following walkthroughs show some ways in which you can extend solutions.  
  
1. [Extending the Solution Explorer Filter](../extensibility/extending-the-solution-explorer-filter.md) explains how to filter what the Solution Explorer displays.  
  
2. [Managing Project Loading in a Solution](../extensibility/managing-project-loading-in-a-solution.md) explains how to manage project loading to improve the performance when a user loads a solution.
