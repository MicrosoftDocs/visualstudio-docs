# Enabling the Azure SDK
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Azure SDK for .NET helps you create, configure, build, debug, run, and package scalable Web applications and services on Azure.  
  
 You can download the Azure SDK from the **New Project** dialog box.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
### To enable the Azure SDK  
  
1. On the **File** menu, create a new project. (Click **New** and then click **Project**.)  
  
2. Expand the node for either **Visual Basic** or **C#** and then click **Cloud**.  
  
3. In the middle pane, select **Get Azure SDK for .NET**, and then click **OK**.  
  
     Follow the instructions in the installer.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > To install the Azure Tools, you must have Internet Information Services 7.0 and the ASP.NET Application Development components installed. If these components are not installed, Azure Tools Setup will prompt you to install them.
