# When a Breakpoint Binds or Becomes Unbound
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When a breakpoint cannot be bound at the time a call is made to the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::CanBind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-canbind.md) method, the bind time and create time of the breakpoint are different.  
  
## Methods Called  
 The session debug manager (SDM) calls the following methods:  
  
1. [IDebugEngine2::CreatePendingBreakpoint](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugengine2-creatependingbreakpoint.md). The DE returns an [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2.md).  
  
2. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-enable.md).  
  
3. [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Virtualize](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-virtualize.md).  
  
4. The [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Bind](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-bind.md) method and returns S_OK. The DE sends an [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointboundevent2.md) or [IDebugBreakpointErrorEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointerrorevent2.md).  
  
5. [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2::GetPendingBreakpoint](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointboundevent2-getpendingbreakpoint.md) and [IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2::EnumBoundBreakpoints](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointboundevent2-enumboundbreakpoints.md) methods to verify and to get the bound breakpoints.
