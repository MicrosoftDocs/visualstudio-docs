# Termination and Detaching
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The following describes normal termination.  
  
## Discussion  
 After the [IDebugLoadCompleteEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugloadcompleteevent2.md) or [IDebugEntryPointEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugentrypointevent2.md) interface continues, if there are no breakpoints, exceptions, run-time errors, or infinite loops in the application to be debugged, the program being debugged will run to completion. This is normal termination.  
  
 You must send an [IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramdestroyevent2.md) to implement normal termination. This requires implementing the [IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2::GetExitCode](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramdestroyevent2-getexitcode.md) method.
