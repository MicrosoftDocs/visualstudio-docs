# UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This structure represents a physical address.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct _tagUNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL {  
   ULONGLONG offset;  
} UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL;  
```  
  
```csharp  
public struct UNMANAGED_ADDRESS_PHYSICAL {  
   public ulong offset;  
}  
```  
  
## Terms  
 offset  
 A 64-bit offset into a physical address space.  
  
## Remarks  
 This structure is part of the union in the [DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address-union.md) structure when the `dwKind` field of the `DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION` structure is set to `ADDRESS_KIND_UNMANAGED_PHYSICAL` (a value from the [ADDRESS_KIND](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/address-kind.md) enumeration).  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: sh.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop  
  
 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
