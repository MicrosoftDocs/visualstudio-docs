# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::SetPassCount
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Sets or changes the pass count associated with this bound breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT SetPassCount(   
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount  
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int SetPassCount(   
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bpPassCount`  
 [in] The [BP_PASSCOUNT](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-passcount.md) structure that specifies the pass count.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).  
  
## Remarks  
 The pass count determines when the breakpoint is fired. The current pass or hit count can be obtained by calling the [GetHitCount](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2-gethitcount.md) method.  
  
 Any pass count that was previously associated with this breakpoint is lost.
