# IDebugPropertyCreateEvent2
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface is sent by the debug engine (DE) to the session debug manager (SDM) when it creates a property that is associated with a specific document.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugPropertyCreateEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The DE implements this interface to report that a property has been created. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface. The SDM uses [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface. This interface is implemented if the DE has created a property associated with a script that has been loaded or created and if that script needs to appear in the IDE.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object to report a property has been created. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function that is supplied by the SDM when it is attached to the program being debugged.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
 The following table shows the method of the `IDebugPropertyCreateEvent2` interface.  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetDebugProperty](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpropertycreateevent2-getdebugproperty.md)|Gets the new property.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If a property has a specific document or script associated with it, the DE can send this event to the SDM in order to update the **Script Documents** window with the name of the document. The SDM will call [GetExtendedInfo](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugproperty2-getextendedinfo.md) with the argument `guidDocument` to retrieve a `VARIANT` containing an [IUnknown](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6b85472-e54b-4b8c-b19f-4454d6c05a8f) pointer. The SDM will call [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) on this pointer to retrieve the [IDebugDocument2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugdocument2.md) interface that is used to update the **Script Documents** window.
