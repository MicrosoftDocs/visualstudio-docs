# IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Delete
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Deletes this pending breakpoint and all breakpoints bound from it.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Delete(   
   void   
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Delete();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the breakpoint has been deleted.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CPendingBreakpoint` object that implements the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2.md) interface.  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT CPendingBreakpoint::Delete(void)    
{    
   HRESULT hr;    
  
   // Verify that the pending breakpoint has not been deleted. If deleted,    
   // then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.    
   if (m_state.state != PBPS_DELETED)    
   {    
      // If the pending breakpoint has bound and has an associated bound   
      // breakpoint, delete and release the bound breakpoint and set the   
      // pointer to NULL.    
      if (m_pBoundBP)    
      {    
         m_pBoundBP->Delete();    
         m_pBoundBP->Release();    
         m_pBoundBP = NULL;    
      }    
      // If the pending breakpoint did not bind and has an associated   
      // error breakpoint, release the error breakpoint and set the   
      // pointer to NULL.   
      if (m_pErrorBP)    
      {    
         m_pErrorBP->Release();    
         m_pErrorBP = NULL;    
      }    
  
      // Set the PENDING_BP_STATE in the PENDING_BP_STATE_INFO structure   
      // to deleted.     
      m_state.state = PBPS_DELETED;    
   }    
   else    
   {    
      hr = E_BP_DELETED;    
   }    
  
   return hr;    
}    
```
