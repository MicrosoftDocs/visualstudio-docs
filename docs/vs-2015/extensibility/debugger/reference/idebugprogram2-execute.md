# IDebugProgram2::Execute
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Continues running this program from a stopped state. Any previous execution state (such as a step) is cleared, and the program starts executing again.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This method is deprecated. Use the [Execute](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprocess3-execute.md) method instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Execute(  
   void  
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Execute();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the user starts execution from a stopped state in some other program's thread, this method is called on this program. This method is also called when the user selects the **Start** command from the **Debug** menu in the IDE. The implementation of this method may be as simple as calling the [Resume](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugthread2-resume.md) method on the current thread in the program.  
  
> [!WARNING]
> Do not send a stopping event or an immediate (synchronous) event to [Event](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2-event.md) while handling this call; otherwise the debugger may stop responding.
