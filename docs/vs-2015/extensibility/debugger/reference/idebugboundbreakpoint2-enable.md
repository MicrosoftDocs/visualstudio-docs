# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Enable
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Enables or disables the breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Enable(   
   BOOL fEnable  
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Enable(   
   int fEnable  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `fEnable`  
 [in] Set to non-zero (`TRUE`) to enable or to zero (`FALSE`) to disable the breakpoint.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.  
  
```  
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::Enable(BOOL fEnable)    
{    
   HRESULT hr;    
  
   // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been deleted. If deleted,   
   // then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.    
   if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)    
   {    
      // Check the state of the bound breakpoint. If the breakpoint is  
      // supposed to be, but has not already been, enabled, then have the  
      // interpreter set the breakpoint.    
      if (fEnable && m_state != BPS_ENABLED)    
      {    
         hr = m_pInterp->SetBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);    
         if (hr == S_OK)    
         {    
            // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_ENABLED.    
            m_state = BPS_ENABLED;    
         }    
      }    
      // Check the state of the bound breakpoint. If the breakpoint is   
      // supposed to be, but has not already been, disabled, then have the   
      // interpreter remove the breakpoint.    
      else if (!fEnable && m_state != BPS_DISABLED)    
      {    
         hr = m_pInterp->RemoveBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);    
         if (hr == S_OK)    
         {    
            // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_DISABLED.    
            m_state = BPS_DISABLED;    
         }    
      }    
      else    
      {    
         hr = S_FALSE;    
      }    
   }    
   else    
   {    
      hr = E_BP_DELETED;    
   }    
  
   return hr;    
}    
```
