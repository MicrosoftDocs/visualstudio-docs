## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
enum enum_ATTACH_REASON {   
   ATTACH_REASON_LAUNCH = 0x0001,  
   ATTACH_REASON_USER   = 0x0002,  
   ATTACH_REASON_AUTO   = 0x0003  
};  
typedef DWORD ATTACH_REASON;  
```  
  
```csharp  
public enum enum_ATTACH_REASON {   
   ATTACH_REASON_LAUNCH = 0x0001,  
   ATTACH_REASON_USER   = 0x0002,  
   ATTACH_REASON_AUTO   = 0x0003  
};  
```
