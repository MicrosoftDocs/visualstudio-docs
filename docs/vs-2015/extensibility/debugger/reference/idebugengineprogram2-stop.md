# IDebugEngineProgram2::Stop
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Stops all threads running in this program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Stop(   
   void   
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Stop();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method is called when this program is being debugged in a multi-program environment. When a stopping event from some other program is received, this method is called on this program. The implementation of this method should be asynchronous; that is, not all threads should be required to be stopped before this method returns. The implementation of this method may be as simple as calling the [CauseBreak](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-causebreak.md) method on this program.  
  
 No debug event is sent in response to this method.
