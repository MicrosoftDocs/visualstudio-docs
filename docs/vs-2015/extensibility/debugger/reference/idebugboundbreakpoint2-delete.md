# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Delete
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Deletes the breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Delete(   
   void   
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Delete();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.  
  
```  
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::Delete(void)    
{    
   HRESULT hr;    
  
   // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been   
   // deleted. If deleted, then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.    
   if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)    
   {    
      m_pInterp->RemoveBreakpoint(m_sbstrDoc, this);    
  
      // Change the state of the breakpoint to BPS_DELETED.    
      m_state = BPS_DELETED;    
      hr = S_OK;    
   }    
   else    
   {    
      hr = E_BP_DELETED;    
   }    
  
   return hr;    
}     
```
