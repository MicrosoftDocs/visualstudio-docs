# IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface tells the session debug manager (SDM) that a bound breakpoint has been unbound from a loaded program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The debug engine (DE) implements this interface as part of its support for breakpoints. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface (the SDM uses [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface).  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object when a bound breakpoint has been unbound. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function supplied by the SDM when it attached to the program being debugged.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
 The following table shows the methods of `IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2`.  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetBreakpoint](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2-getbreakpoint.md)|Gets the breakpoint that became unbound.|  
|[GetReason](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointunboundevent2-getreason.md)|Gets the reason the breakpoint was unbound.|  
  
## Remarks  
 When a debug engine DLL or class unloads, all breakpoints that were bound to code in that module must be unbound from the program being debugged. An `IDebugBreakpointUnboundEvent2` is sent for each unbound breakpoint.  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: msdbg.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop  
  
 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
