# IDebugInterceptExceptionCompleteEvent2
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface is sent by the debug engine (DE) to the session debug manager (SDM) when the DE has completed the handling of an intercepted event.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugInterceptExceptionCompleteEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The DE implements this interface to report that processing of an intercepted exception has been completed. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface. The SDM uses [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object to report the completion of an intercepted exception. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function that is supplied by the SDM when it attached to the program being debugged.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
 The `IDebugInterceptExceptionCompleteEvent2` interface implements the following methods.  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetInterceptCookie](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebuginterceptexceptioncompleteevent2-getinterceptcookie.md)|Returns the unique value associated with the handled exception.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This event will be sent by [InterceptCurrentException](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugstackframe3-interceptcurrentexception.md) when that method has successfully completed handling an intercepted exception.  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: msdbg.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop  
  
 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
