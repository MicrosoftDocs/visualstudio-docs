# SEEK_START
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Specifies the position from which to start seeking in a disassembly stream.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
enum enum_SEEK_START {   
   SEEK_START_BEGIN       = 0x0001,  
   SEEK_START_END         = 0x0002,  
   SEEK_START_CURRENT     = 0x0003,  
   SEEK_START_CODECONTEXT = 0x0004,  
   SEEK_START_CODELOCID   = 0x0005  
};  
typedef DWORD SEEK_START;  
```  
  
```csharp  
public enum enum_SEEK_START {   
   SEEK_START_BEGIN       = 0x0001,  
   SEEK_START_END         = 0x0002,  
   SEEK_START_CURRENT     = 0x0003,  
   SEEK_START_CODECONTEXT = 0x0004,  
   SEEK_START_CODELOCID   = 0x0005  
};  
```  
  
## Members  
 SEEK_START_BEGIN  
 Starts seeking at the beginning of the current document.  
  
 SEEK_START_END  
 Starts seeking at the end of the current document.  
  
 SEEK_START_CURRENT  
 Starts seeking at the current position of the current document.  
  
 SEEK_START_CODECONTEXT  
 Starts seeking at the given code context of the current document.  
  
 SEEK_START_CODELOCID  
 Starts seeking at the given code location identifier. Code location identifiers are obtained by calling [GetCurrentLocation](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugdisassemblystream2-getcurrentlocation.md).  
  
## Remarks
