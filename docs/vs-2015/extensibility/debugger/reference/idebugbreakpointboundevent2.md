# IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface tells the session debug manager (SDM) that a pending breakpoint has been successfully bound to a loaded program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The DE implements this interface as part of its support for breakpoints. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface (the SDM uses [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface).  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object when a pending breakpoint is successfully bound to the program being debugged. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function supplied by the SDM when it attached to the program being debugged.  
  
## Methods in Vtable Order  
 The following table shows the methods of `IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2`.  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetPendingBreakpoint](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointboundevent2-getpendingbreakpoint.md)|Gets the pending breakpoint that is being bound.|  
|[EnumBoundBreakpoints](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointboundevent2-enumboundbreakpoints.md)|Creates an enumerator of breakpoints that were bound on this event.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Whenever a breakpoint is bound, an event is sent to the SDM. If the breakpoint cannot be bound, an [IDebugBreakpointErrorEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointerrorevent2.md) is sent; otherwise, an `IDebugBreakpointBoundEvent2` is sent.
