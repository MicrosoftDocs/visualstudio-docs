# IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::GetBreakpointResolution
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Gets the breakpoint resolution that describes this breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT GetBreakpointResolution(   
   IDebugBreakpointResolution2** ppBPResolution  
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int GetBreakpointResolution(   
   out IDebugBreakpointResolution2 ppBPResolution  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ppBPResolution`  
 [out] Returns the [IDebugBreakpointResolution2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointresolution2.md) interface that represents one of the following:  
  
- The breakpoint resolution object that describes the location in code where a code breakpoint has been bound.  
  
- The data location where a data breakpoint has bound.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the state of the bound breakpoint object is set to `BPS_DELETED` (part of the [BP_STATE](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/bp-state.md) enumeration).  
  
## Remarks  
 Call the [GetBreakpointType](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugbreakpointresolution2-getbreakpointtype.md) method to determine if the breakpoint resolution is for code or data.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CBoundBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2.md) interface.  
  
```  
HRESULT CBoundBreakpoint::GetBreakpointResolution(  
    IDebugBreakpointResolution2** ppBPResolution)  
{    
   HRESULT hr;    
  
   if (ppBPResolution)    
   {    
      // Verify that the bound breakpoint has not been deleted. If   
      // deleted, then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.    
      if (m_state != BPS_DELETED)    
      {    
         // Query for the IDebugBreakpointResolution2 interface.    
         hr = m_pBPRes->QueryInterface(IID_IDebugBreakpointResolution2,  
                                       (void **)ppBPResolution);  
         assert(hr == S_OK);    
      }    
      else    
      {    
         hr = E_BP_DELETED;    
      }    
   }    
   else    
   {    
      hr = E_INVALIDARG;    
   }    
  
   return hr;    
}    
```
