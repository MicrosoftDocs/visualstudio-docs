# IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Enable
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Toggles the enabled state of the pending breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT Enable(   
   BOOL fEnable  
);  
```  
  
```csharp  
int Enable(   
   int fEnable  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `fEnable`  
 [in] Set to nonzero (`TRUE`) to enable a pending breakpoint, or to zero (`FALSE`) to disable.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the breakpoint has been deleted.  
  
## Remarks  
 When a pending breakpoint is enabled or disabled, all breakpoints bound from it are set to the same state.  
  
 This method may be called as many times as necessary, even if the breakpoint is already enabled or disabled.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to implement this method for a simple `CPendingBreakpoint` object that exposes the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2.md) interface.  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT CPendingBreakpoint::Enable(BOOL fEnable)    
{    
   HRESULT hr;    
  
   // Verify that the pending breakpoint has not been deleted. If deleted,   
   // then return hr = E_BP_DELETED.    
   if (m_state.state != PBPS_DELETED)    
   {    
      // If the bound breakpoint member variable is valid, then enable or   
      // disable the bound breakpoint.    
      if (m_pBoundBP)    
      {    
         m_pBoundBP->Enable(fEnable);    
      }    
      // Set the PENDING_BP_STATE in the PENDING_BP_STATE_INFO structure   
      // to enabled or disabled depending on the passed BOOL condition.    
      m_state.state = fEnable ? PBPS_ENABLED : PBPS_DISABLED;    
      hr = S_OK;    
  
   }    
   else    
   {    
      hr = E_BP_DELETED;    
   }    
  
   return hr;    
}    
```
