# IDebugThreadCreateEvent2
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface is sent by the debug engine (DE) to the session debug manager (SDM) when a thread is created in a program being debugged.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugThreadCreateEvent2 : IUnknown  
```  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 The DE implements this interface to report that a thread has been created. The [IDebugEvent2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugevent2.md) interface must be implemented on the same object as this interface. The SDM uses [QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/62fce95e-aafa-4187-b50b-e6611b74c3b3) to access the `IDebugEvent2` interface.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 The DE creates and sends this event object to report that a thread has been created. The event is sent by using the [IDebugEventCallback2](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugeventcallback2.md) callback function that is supplied by the SDM when it is attached to the program being debugged.  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: msdbg.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop  
  
 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
