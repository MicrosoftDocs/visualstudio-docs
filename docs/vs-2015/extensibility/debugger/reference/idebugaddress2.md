[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This interface provides access to the ID of the process that owns the object whose address is represented by this interface.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
IDebugAddress2 : IDebugAddress

 A symbol provider implements this interface on the same object that implements the [IDebugAddress](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugaddress.md) interface. This interface provides access to the ID of the process that owns the object that is related to this address.  
  
## Notes for Callers

|Method|Description|
