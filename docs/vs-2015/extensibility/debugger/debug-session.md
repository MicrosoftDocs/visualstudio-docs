# Debug Session
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In terms of the debugger architecture, a **session**:  
  
- Is the set of all processes, related or unrelated, that have been launched or attached to from a single instance of the IDE.  
  
- Is implemented by a session debug manager (SDM). For more information, see [Session Debug Manager](../../extensibility/debugger/session-debug-manager.md).
