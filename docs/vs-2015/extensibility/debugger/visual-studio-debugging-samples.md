# Visual Studio Debugging Samples
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Two samples show how to extend the Visual Studio debugger using [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../../includes/vsipsdk-md.md)].  
  
- The Debugger Expression Evaluator Sample, for managed languages, is included in the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../../includes/vsipsdk-md.md)]. In the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../../includes/vsipsdk-md.md)] window, click the **Samples** tab, click **All** or **C#** in the list of languages, and then click **Debugger**.  
  
- The Visual Studio Debug Engine Sample, for native languages, is available on MSDN Code Gallery. For more information, see this page on the Microsoft Web site: [Visual Studio Debug Engine Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150236).
