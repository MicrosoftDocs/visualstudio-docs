# Symbol Provider
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

An expression evaluator implementation must access the symbolic debug information generated by the language compiler in order to evaluate variables and expressions. It does so by consuming the interfaces of a symbol provider (SP), also called a symbol handler.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] supplies SPs for managed code as well as native code using the Program DataBase (PDB) symbol file format. Unless there is a strong need for your program to use symbols stored in a custom format, it is recommended that you use the SPs supplied by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## Implementation Notes  
 The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] debug engines expect to talk with the SPs using Common Language Runtime (CLR) interfaces. As a result, an SP that will be working with the Visual Studio debug engines must support the CLR. A complete list of all CLR debugging interfaces can be found in debugref.doc, which is part of the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../../includes/winsdklong-md.md)].  
  
 If your SP will be working only with your custom debug engine, you can implement the SP as you see fit depending on the needs of your debug engine.
