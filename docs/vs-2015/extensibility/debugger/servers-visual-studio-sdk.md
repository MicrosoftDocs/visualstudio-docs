# Servers (Visual Studio SDK)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In terms of the debugger architecture, a **server**:  
  
- Is a container of ports and port suppliers and is used to communicate ports and port suppliers to the session debug manager (SDM) and debug engines.  
  
- Can identify itself by name, and enumerate its ports and port suppliers.  
  
- Is represented by an [IDebugCoreServer2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugcoreserver2.md) interface, which is only implemented by Visual Studio (one instance of a server for each instance of Visual Studio running).
