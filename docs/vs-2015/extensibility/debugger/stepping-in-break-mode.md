# Stepping in Break Mode
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The following describes the process that occurs when the debugger is in break mode and must step through code:  
  
## Stepping Process  
  
1. Call [IDebugProgram2::Step](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogram2-step.md) with [STEPKIND](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/stepkind.md) and [STEPUNIT](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/stepunit.md) arguments to execute a step.  
  
2. When the step is finished, send an [IDebugStepCompleteEvent2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugstepcompleteevent2.md) as a stopping event.
