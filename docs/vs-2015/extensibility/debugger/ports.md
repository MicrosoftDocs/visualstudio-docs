# Ports
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In terms of the debugger architecture, a **port**:  
  
- Is a container for a set of processes running on a server. For example, a port might represent a connection to a Windows CE-based device by a serial cable, or to a networked non-DCOM machine. One special port, called the local port, contains all the processes running on the local machine.  
  
- Can identify itself by name or identifier.  
  
- Can enumerate all processes running on the port and launch and terminate these processes.  
  
- Is represented by an [IDebugPort2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugport2.md) interface, which is created by passing an [IDebugPortRequest2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportrequest2.md) argument to [AddPort](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-addport.md).  
  
  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] supplies a default port that handles all Windows-based processes, native and managed. A custom port must be implemented for connections with external devices that are not Windows-based. To supply such custom ports, a custom port supplier also needs to be implemented.
