# m_stateObject Field
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

An object that represents data that the action will use.  
  
 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)  
  
 Because you cannot access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
.field assembly object m_stateObject  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This is the `state` parameter in the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.%23ctor%2A> constructor. It is also the backing field for the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.AsyncState%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.
