# Modules
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In terms of the debugger architecture, a **module**:  
  
- Is a physical container of code, such as an executable file or a DLL.  
  
- Can reload its symbols and describe itself. Module descriptions are displayed in the Modules window of the IDE.  
  
- Is represented by an [IDebugModule2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugmodule2.md) interface, created by a debug engine to describe the module.
