# ContingentProperties Class - Internal Members
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Contains additional properties for a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> object.  
  
 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)  
  
 Because you cannot access these internal members from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
.class auto ansi nested assembly beforefieldinit ContingentProperties  
       extends System.Object  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Fields  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[m_children](../../extensibility/debugger/m-children-field.md)|The list of child tasks that are registered with this task.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The .NET Framework initializes the fields of this class only when they are needed.
