Retrieves an array of all scheduled tasks.  
  
 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)  
  
 Because you cannot access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
.method assembly hidebysig instance class System.Threading.Tasks.Task[] GetScheduledTasksForDebugger() cil managed  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 An array of all scheduled tasks. Each task is executing or has finished executing.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method is not thread safe and should not be used concurrently with other instances of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler> It should be called from a debugger only when the debugger has suspended all other threads.
