# Debugging Tasks
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To debug a program, it must be launched and a debug engine (DE) must be attached to it, or else the DE must be attached to a previously launched program. Once attached, the DE must generate certain startup events. In response, the debug package attempts to bind the breakpoints set in the IDE. When the program hits a bound breakpoint, it halts and waits for user input.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Security Issues](../../extensibility/debugger/security-issues.md)  
 Discusses the security steps that are needed to debug a program.  
  
 [Launching a Program](../../extensibility/debugger/launching-a-program.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions on how to specify a DE, which calls the operating system to launch the program.  
  
 [Attaching Directly to a Program](../../extensibility/debugger/attaching-directly-to-a-program.md)  
 Describes the process used to debug a program in a process that is already running.  
  
 [Sending Startup Events After a Launch](../../extensibility/debugger/sending-startup-events-after-a-launch.md)  
 Lists the events that take place once the DE is attached to the program, until the program is at its main entry point and is ready for debugging.  
  
 [Control of Execution](../../extensibility/debugger/control-of-execution.md)  
 Explains how the DE typically sends an entry-point event, a load-complete event, or a stopping event, depending on the circumstances.  
  
 [Binding Breakpoints](../../extensibility/debugger/binding-breakpoints.md)  
 Describes how, if the user sets a breakpoint, the IDE formulates the request and prompts the debug session to create the breakpoint.  
  
 [Evaluating Expressions](../../extensibility/debugger/evaluating-expressions.md)  
 Explains how expressions are created and what happens when an expression is evaluated.  
  
 [Visualizing and Viewing Data](../../extensibility/debugger/visualizing-and-viewing-data.md)  
 Explains how type visualizers and custom viewers are supported by the expression evaluator (EE).  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugger Concepts](../../extensibility/debugger/debugger-concepts.md)  
 Describes the main debugging architectural concepts.  
  
 [Debugger Components](../../extensibility/debugger/debugger-components.md)  
 Provides an overview of the Visual Studio debugging components, which include the DE, EE, and symbol handler (SH).  
  
 [Debugger Contexts](../../extensibility/debugger/debugger-contexts.md)  
 Explains how the DE operates simultaneously within code, documentation, and expression evaluation contexts. Describes, for each of the three contexts, the location, position, or evaluation relevant to it.
