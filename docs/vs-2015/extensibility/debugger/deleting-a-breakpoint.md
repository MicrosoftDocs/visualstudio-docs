# Deleting a Breakpoint
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The following describes the process when deleting a pending breakpoint:  
  
## Deletion Process  
 The session debug manager (SDM) calls the [IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::Delete](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugpendingbreakpoint2-delete.md) method to remove the pending breakpoint and all bound breakpoints bound from it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> A single bound breakpoint can also be deleted by a call to [IDebugBoundBreakpoint2::Delete](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugboundbreakpoint2-delete.md).
