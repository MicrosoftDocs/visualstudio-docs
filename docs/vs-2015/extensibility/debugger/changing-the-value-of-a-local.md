# Changing the Value of a Local
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Visual Studio 2015, this way of implementing expression evaluators is deprecated. For information about implementing CLR expression evaluators, please see [CLR Expression Evaluators](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/wiki/CLR-Expression-Evaluators) and [Managed Expression Evaluator Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/wiki/Managed-Expression-Evaluator-Sample).  
  
 When a new value is typed in the value field of the **Locals** window, the debug package passes the string, as typed, to the expression evaluator (EE). The EE evaluates this string, which can contain either a simple value or an expression, and stores the resulting value in the associated local.  
  
 This is an overview of the process of changing the value of a local:  
  
1. After the user enters the new value, Visual Studio calls [SetValueAsString](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugproperty2-setvalueasstring.md) on the [IDebugProperty2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugproperty2.md) object associated with the local.  
  
2. `IDebugProperty2::SetValueAsString` performs the following tasks:  
  
   1. Evaluates the string to produce a value.  
  
   2. Binds the associated [IDebugField](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugfield.md) object to obtain an [IDebugObject](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugobject.md) object.  
  
   3. Converts the value to a series of bytes.  
  
   4. Calls [SetValue](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugobject-setvalue.md) to put the value's bytes into memory so the program being debugged can access them.  
  
3. Visual Studio refreshes the **Locals** display (see [Displaying Locals](../../extensibility/debugger/displaying-locals.md) for details).  
  
   This procedure is also used to change the value of a variable in the **Watch** window except it is the `IDebugProperty2` object associated with the value of the local that is used instead of the `IDebugProperty2` object associated with the local itself.

 [Sample Implementation of Changing Values](../../extensibility/debugger/sample-implementation-of-changing-values.md)  
 Uses the MyCEE sample to step through the process of changing values.
