# TASK_STATE_CANCELED Field
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The task was canceled before it reached the running state, or it acknowledged its cancellation and completed without exception.  
  
 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)  
  
 Because you cannot access this internal member from the .NET Framework, the following syntax is provided in Common Intermediate Language (CIL).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
.field static assembly literal int32 TASK_STATE_CANCELED = int32(0x00800000)  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 If the [m_stateFlags](../../extensibility/debugger/m-stateflags-field.md) field contains this value, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Status%2A> property returns <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskStatus?displayProperty=fullName>.
