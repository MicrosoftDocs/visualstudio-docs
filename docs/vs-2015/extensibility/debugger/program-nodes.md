# Program Nodes
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In terms of the debugger architecture, a **program node**:  
  
- Is a lightweight description of a program.  
  
- Can identify itself and the process it is running in, and can be attached to, be detached from, and describe the debug engine (DE) that created it, if any.  
  
- Is represented by an [IDebugProgramNode2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugprogramnode2.md) interface, typically created by a DE or port. Program nodes are added to a port by calling [AddProgramNode](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportnotify2-addprogramnode.md). When a program node is added to a port, it is added to the process containing the program that this program node represents.  
  
  Sometime after a debug session is started, depending on the implementation of the debug package, program nodes are used to create corresponding programs. When a process is queried for its programs, the programs are enumerated, one for each program node.  
  
  Before a program is attached to, the IDE needs only a lightweight description of the program. This information can be obtained from the program node. Once the program is attached to, the IDE needs to display more detailed information, such as a list of all threads running in the program. This information is obtained from the program itself.
