# SetNotificationForWaitCompletion Method
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Sets or clears the TASK_STATE_WAIT_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION state bit.  
  
 **Namespace:** <xref:System.Threading.Tasks?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 **Assembly:** mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
internal void SetNotificationForWaitCompletion(bool enabled)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `enabled`  
  
 `true` to set the bit; `false` to unset the bit.  
  
## Exceptions  
  
## Remarks  
 The debugger sets this bit to help step out of an async method body. If `enabled` is `true`, this method must be called only on a task that has not yet been completed. If `enabled` is `false`, this method may be called on completed tasks. In either event, it should only be used for promise-style tasks.
