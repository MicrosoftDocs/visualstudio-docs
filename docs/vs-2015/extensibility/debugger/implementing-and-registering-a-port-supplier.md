# Implementing and Registering a Port Supplier
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The role of a port supplier is to track and supply ports, which in turn manage processes. At the time a port needs to be created, the port supplier is instantiated using CoCreate with the port supplier's GUID (the session debug manager [SDM] will use the port supplier the user selected or the port supplier specified by the project system). The SDM will then call [CanAddPort](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-canaddport.md) to see if any ports can be added. If a port can be added, a new port is requested by calling [AddPort](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-addport.md) and passing it an [IDebugPortRequest2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportrequest2.md) that describes the port. `AddPort` will return a new port represented by an [IDebugPort2](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugport2.md) interface.  
  
## Discussion  
 A port is created by a port supplier, which is in turn associated with a machine or debug server. A server can enumerate its port suppliers through the[EnumPortSuppliers](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugcoreserver2-enumportsuppliers.md) method, and a port supplier can enumerate its ports through the [EnumPorts](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-enumports.md) method.  
  
 In addition to the typical COM registration, a port supplier must register itself with Visual Studio by placing its CLSID and name in specific registry locations. A Debugging SDK helper function called `SetMetric` handles this chore: it is called once for each item to be registered, thus:  
  
```cpp#  
SetMetric(metrictypePortSupplier,  
          <GUID of your port supplier>,  
          metricCLSID,  
          <CLSID of your port supplier>,  
          false,  
          NULL)  
SetMetric(metrictypePortSupplier,  
          <GUID of your port supplier>,  
          metricName,  
          <name of your port supplier>,  
          false,  
          NULL);  
```  
  
 A port supplier unregisters itself by calling `RemoveMetric` (another Debugging SDK helper function) once for each item that was registered, thus:  
  
```cpp#  
RemoveMetric(metrictypePortSupplier,  
             <GUID of your port supplier>,  
             metricCLSID,  
             NULL);  
RemoveMetric(metrictypePortSupplier,  
             <GUID of your port supplier>,  
             metricName,  
             NULL);  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The [SDK Helpers for Debugging](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/sdk-helpers-for-debugging.md)`SetMetric` and `RemoveMetric` are static functions defined in dbgmetric.h and compiled into ad2de.lib. The `metrictypePortSupplier`, `metricCLSID`, and `metricName` helpers are also defined in dbgmetric.h.  
  
 A port supplier can supply its name and GUID through the methods [GetPortSupplierName](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-getportsuppliername.md) and [GetPortSupplierId](../../extensibility/debugger/reference/idebugportsupplier2-getportsupplierid.md), respectively.
