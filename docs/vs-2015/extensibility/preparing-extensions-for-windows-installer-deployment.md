# Preparing Extensions for Windows Installer Deployment
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You cannot use a Windows Installer package (MSI) to deploy a VSIX package. However, you can extract the contents of a VSIX package for MSI deployment. This document shows how to prepare a project whose default output is a VSIX package for inclusion in a Setup project.  
  
## Preparing an Extension Project for Windows Installer Deployment  
 Perform these steps on new extension projects before adding to a Setup project.  
  
#### To prepare an extension project for Windows Installer deployment  
  
1. Create a VSPackage, MEF component, Editor Adornment, or other extensibility project type that includes a VSIX manifest.  
  
2. Open the VSIX manifest in the code editor.  
  
3. Set the InstalledByMsi element of the VSIX manifest to `true`. For more information about the VSIX manifest, see [VSIX Extension Schema 2.0 Reference](../extensibility/vsix-extension-schema-2-0-reference.md).  
  
     This prevents the VSIX installer from attempting to install the component.  
  
4. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and click **Properties**.  
  
5. Select the **VSIX** tab.  
  
6. Check the box labeled **Copy VSIX content to the following location** and type the path to where the Setup project will pick up the files.  
  
## Extracting Files from an Existing VSIX Package  
 Perform these steps to add the content of an existing VSIX package to a Setup project when you do not have the source files.  
  
#### To extract files from an existing VSIX package  
  
1. Rename the .VSIX file containing the extension from *filename*.vsix to *filename*.zip.  
  
2. Copy the contents of the .zip file into a directory.  
  
3. Delete the [Content_types].xml file from the directory.  
  
4. Edit the VSIX manifest, as shown in the previous procedure.  
  
5. Add the remaining files to your Setup project.
