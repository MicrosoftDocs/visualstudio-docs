# How to: Use Built-In Colorable Items
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Before you use the built-in colorable items, you must first signal to the integrated development environment (IDE) that you are not providing your own custom colorable items, which in this case would be <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsProvideColorableItems> objects. You do this by setting a registry entry for the language service.  
  
### To use built-in colorable items  
  
1. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\VisualStudio\\*X.Y*\Languages\Language Services\\*Language Name*, where *X.Y* is a version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and *Language Name* is the name of your language, create a DWORD registry entry value called `RequestStockColors`.  
  
2. Set the `RequestStockColors` registry entry value to 1.  
  
     After you create the registry entry, your colorizer's <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.IVsColorizer.ColorizeLine%2A> method can use the members of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextManager.Interop.DEFAULTITEMS> enumeration to fill in the array of color attributes for use by the editor.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Do not set this registry entry if you are providing custom colorable items. For more information, see [Custom Colorable Items](../../extensibility/internals/custom-colorable-items.md).
