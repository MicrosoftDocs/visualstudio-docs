# How to: Create a .Vsct File
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

There are several ways to create an XML-based Visual Studio Command Table configuration (.vsct) file.  
  
- You can create a new VSPackage in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Package Template.  
  
- You can use the XML-based command table configuration compiler, Vsct.exe, to generate a file from an existing .ctc file.  
  
- You can use Vsct.exe to generate a .vsct file from an existing .cto file.  
  
- You can manually create a new .vsct file.  
  
  This topic explains how to manually create a new .vsct file.  
  
### To manually create a new .vsct file  
  
1. Start [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **File**.  
  
3. In the **Templates** pane, click **XML File** and then click **Open**.  
  
4. On the **View** menu, click **Properties Window** to display the properties of the XML file.  
  
5. In the **Properties** window, click the Browse (â€¦) button on the Schemas property.  
  
6. In the list of XSD schemas, select the vsct.xsd schema. If it is not in the list, click **Add** and then find the file on a local drive. Click **OK** when you are finished.  
  
7. In the XML file, type `<CommandTable` and then press TAB. Close the tag by typing `>`.  
  
     This creates a basic .vsct file.  
  
8. Fill in the elements of the XML file that you want to add, according to the [VSCT Schema](../../extensibility/vsct-xml-schema-reference.md). For more information, see [Authoring .Vsct Files](../../extensibility/internals/authoring-dot-vsct-files.md)  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Simply adding a .vsct file to a project does not cause it to compile. You must incorporate it in the build process.  
  
### To add a .vsct file to project compilation  
  
1. Open your project file in the editor. If the project is loaded, you must unload it first.  
  
2. Add an [ItemGroup element](../../msbuild/itemgroup-element-msbuild.md) that contains a VSCTCompile element, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```xml  
    <ItemGroup>  
      <VSCTCompile Include="TopLevelMenu.vsct">  
        <ResourceName>Menus.ctmenu</ResourceName>  
      </VSCTCompile>  
    </ItemGroup>  
  
    ```  
  
     The ResourceName element should always be set to `Menus.ctmenu`.  
  
3. If your project contains a .resx file, add an EmbeddedResource element that contains a MergeWithCTO element, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```xml  
    <EmbeddedResource Include="VSPackage.resx">  
      <MergeWithCTO>true</MergeWithCTO>  
      <ManifestResourceName>VSPackage</ManifestResourceName>  
    </EmbeddedResource>  
  
    ```  
  
     This markup should go inside the ItemGroup element that contains embedded resources.  
  
4. Open the package file, usually named *ProjectName*Package.cs or *ProjectName*Package.vb, in the editor.  
  
5. Add a ProvideMenuResource attribute to the package class, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```csharp  
    [ProvideMenuResource("Menus.ctmenu", 1)]  
    ```  
  
     The first parameter value must match the value of the ResourceName attribute you defined in the project file.
