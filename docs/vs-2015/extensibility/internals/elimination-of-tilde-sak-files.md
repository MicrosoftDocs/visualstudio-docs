# Elimination of ~SAK Files
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In Source Control Plug-in API 1.2, the ~SAK files have been replaced by capability flags and new functions that detect whether a source control plug-in supports the MSSCCPRJ file and shared checkouts.  
  
## ~SAK Files  
 Visual Studio .NET 2003 created temporary files prefixed with ~SAK. These files are used to determine if a source control plug-in supports:  
  
- The MSSCCPRJ.SCC file.  
  
- Multiple (shared) checkouts.  
  
  For plug-ins that support advanced functions provided in the Source Control Plug-in API 1.2, the IDE can detect these capabilities without creating the temporary files through the use of new capabilities, flags, and functions, detailed in the following sections.  
  
## New Capability Flags  
 `SCC_CAP_SCCFILE`  
  
 `SCC_CAP_MULTICHECKOUT`  
  
## New Functions  
 [SccWillCreateSccFile](../../extensibility/sccwillcreatesccfile-function.md)  
  
 [SccIsMultiCheckoutEnabled](../../extensibility/sccismulticheckoutenabled-function.md)  
  
 If a source control plug-in supports multiple (shared) checkouts, then it declares the `SCC_CAP_MULTICHECKOUT` capability and implements the `SccIsMultiCheckOutEnabled` function. This function is called whenever a checkout operation occurs on any of the source-controlled projects.  
  
 If a source control plug-in supports the creation and use of an MSSCCPRJ.SCC file, then it declares the `SCC_CAP_SCCFILE` capability and implements the [SccWillCreateSccFile](../../extensibility/sccwillcreatesccfile-function.md). This function is called with a list of files. The function returns `TRUE/FALSE` for each file to indicate whether Visual Studio should use an MSSCCPRJ.SCC file for it. If the source control plug-in chooses not to support these new capabilities and functions, it can use the following registry key to disable the creation of these files:  
  
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\SourceControl] "DoNotCreateTemporaryFilesInSourceControl"=dword:00000001  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If this registry key is set to dword:00000000, it is equivalent to the key being nonexistent, and Visual Studio still attempts to create the temporary files. However, if the registry key is set to dword:00000001, Visual Studio does not attempt to create the temporary files. Instead it assumes that the source control plug-in does not support the MSSCCPRJ.SCC file and does not support shared checkouts.
