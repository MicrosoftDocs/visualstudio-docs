# When to Create Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Creating a new project type provides a basis for customizing [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] for your users. However, creating a new project type is not required for all [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] customizations. The following guidelines should help you determine whether a new project type is required for your scenario.  
  
## Create a New Project Type  
 You must create a project type if you want to customize [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] to act in one or more of the following ways:  
  
- Participate in build, deploy, configurations, and source control.  
  
- Offer debugging support.  
  
- Display project items in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
- Use the **Open Project** or **New Project** dialog box.  
  
- Support project nesting.  
  
## Extend an Existing Project Type  
 You might want to create a new project type that can use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] in the following ways to modify or extend the behavior of an existing project type, for example, modifying the build process for [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)] projects:  
  
- Work with multiple files as a single unit.  
  
- Display a single file as a hierarchy of sub-items.  
  
- Display a command context around editors.  
  
- Display a service context for editors.  
  
## Use an Existing Project Type  
 Creating a new project is sometimes not necessary. The following table shows the tasks that you do not have to create a project type for.  
  
|Task|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|Handling commands|Any VSPackage can handle commands.|  
|Building an editor|Custom editors can be registered. For more information, see [Document Windows and Editors](https://msdn.microsoft.com/603625e1-62b6-413a-bc44-089346e166bc).|  
|Owning windows|You can create both tool and document windows without adding a new project type.|  
|Exposing properties in the Properties window|All objects can expose properties.|  
  
## Create a Project Subtype  
 You can use project subtypes to extend a managed project type without having to create a new project type. Project subtypes use COM aggregation to extend managed projects written in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]. With COM aggregation, you can reuse much of the managed project system implementation and  still customize for a particular scenario through aggregation and the use of supporting interfaces. For more information about project subtypes, see [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md).
