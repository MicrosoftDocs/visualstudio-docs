# VSPackage Structure (Source Control VSPackage)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Source Control Package SDK provides guidelines for creating a VSPackage that allow a source control implementer to integrate his or her source control functionality with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] environment. A VSPackage is a COM component that is typically loaded on demand by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) based on the services that are advertised by the package in its registry entries. Every VSPackage must implement the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPackage>. A VSPackage typically consumes services offered by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE and proffers some services of its own.  
  
 A VSPackage declares its menu items and establishes a default item state via the .vsct file. The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE displays the menu items in this state until the VSPackage is loaded. Subsequently, the VSPackage's implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleCommandTarget.QueryStatus%2A> method is called to enable or disable menu items.  
  
## Source Control Package Characteristics  
 A source control VSPackage is deeply integrated into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 The VSPackage semantics include:  
  
- Interface to be implemented by virtue of being a VSPackage (the `IVsPackage` interface)  
  
- UI Command implementation (.vsct file and implementation of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.IOleCommandTarget> interface)  
  
- Registration of the VSPackage with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
  The source control VSPackage must communicate with these other [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] entities:  
  
- Projects  
  
- Editors  
  
- Solutions  
  
- Windows  
  
- The running document table

### VSIP Interfaces Implemented and Called  
 A source control package is a VSPackage, and therefore it can interact directly with other VSPackages that are registered with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. In order to provide the full breadth of source control functionality, a source control VSPackage can deal with interfaces provided by projects or the shell.  
  
 Every project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] must implement the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsProject3> to be recognized as a project within the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE. However, this interface is not specialized enough for source control. Projects that are expected to be under source control implement the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSccProject2>. This interface is used by the source control VSPackage to query a project for its contents and to provide it glyphs and binding information (the information needed to establish a connection between the server location and the disk location of a project that is under source control).  
  
 The source control VSPackage implements the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSccManager2>, which in turn allows projects to register themselves for source control and retrieve their status glyphs.  
  
 For a complete list of interfaces that a source control VSPackage must consider, see [Related Services and Interfaces](../../extensibility/internals/related-services-and-interfaces-source-control-vspackage.md).
