# Checklist: Creating New Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You must complete several tasks to create a new project type. The following checklist provides a guide to those tasks.  
  
1. Design the functionality for your new project type. For more information, see [Project Type Design Decisions](../../extensibility/internals/project-type-design-decisions.md).  
  
2. Determine which editors are used for code and other project elements. You can use the core or standard editors, or you can create and use project-specific editors. For more information, see [Creating Custom Editors and Designers](../../extensibility/creating-custom-editors-and-designers.md) and [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../../extensibility/how-to-open-project-specific-editors.md).  
  
3. Determine the level of participation your project items will have in the **Class View** and the **Object Browser**. For more information, see [Supporting Symbol-Browsing Tools](../../extensibility/internals/supporting-symbol-browsing-tools.md).  
  
4. Derive new classes based on design decisions that you made previously for your project and project items.  
  
5. Write the code for the following project type components:  
  
    - Project factory, to manage creating new projects and opening existing projects. For more information, see [Creating Project Instances By Using Project Factories](../../extensibility/internals/creating-project-instances-by-using-project-factories.md).  
  
    - Project hierarchy and command handling. For more information, see [Not in Build: Using HierUtil7 Project Classes to Implement a Project Type (C++)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/a5c16a09-94a2-46ef-87b5-35b815e2f346), [Elements of a Project Model](../../extensibility/internals/elements-of-a-project-model.md), [Project Model Core Components](../../extensibility/internals/project-model-core-components.md) and [MenuCommands Vs. OleMenuCommands](../../misc/menucommands-vs-olemenucommands.md).  
  
    - Project items management, including adding your project to the **New Project** dialog box. For more information, see [Adding Project and Project Item Templates](../../extensibility/internals/adding-project-and-project-item-templates.md) and [Registering Project and Item Templates](../../extensibility/internals/registering-project-and-item-templates.md).  
  
    - Persistence of project state and individual items. For more information, see [Opening and Saving Project Items](../../extensibility/internals/opening-and-saving-project-items.md). For persistence of solution information, see [Solutions](../../extensibility/internals/solutions-overview.md).  
  
    - Configuration independent properties to display in the Properties window. For more information, see [Extending Properties](../../extensibility/internals/extending-properties.md).  
  
    - Project configuration properties as implemented in property pages to show configuration-dependent properties. For more information, see [Managing Configuration Options](../../extensibility/internals/managing-configuration-options.md).  
  
    - Enumerating outputs for deployment. For more information, see [Project Configuration for Output](../../extensibility/internals/project-configuration-for-output.md).  
  
    - Project startup services. For more information, see [Elements of a Project Model](../../extensibility/internals/elements-of-a-project-model.md) and [Project Model Core Components](../../extensibility/internals/project-model-core-components.md).  
  
    - Objects, or classes derived from `IDispatch`, available for Automation.  
  
    - XML Command Table (.vsct) files. For more information, see [Visual Studio Command Table (.Vsct) Files](../../extensibility/internals/visual-studio-command-table-dot-vsct-files.md).  
  
6. Test, debug, and start your project type.  
  
7. Display your project in the **Project** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box by setting `VARIANT_TRUE` as the value for `VSHPROPID_ShowProjInSolutionPage`. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.__VSHPROPID> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsHierarchy.GetProperty%2A>.  
  
8. Create the Microsoft Installer (.msi) file for installing your VSPackages. For more information, see [Installing VSPackages With Windows Installer](../../extensibility/internals/installing-vspackages-with-windows-installer.md), [Registering a Project Type](../../extensibility/internals/registering-a-project-type.md), and [VSPackages](../../extensibility/internals/vspackages.md).
