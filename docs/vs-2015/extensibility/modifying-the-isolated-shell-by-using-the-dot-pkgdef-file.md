# Modifying the Isolated Shell By Using the .Pkgdef File
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The .pkgdef file supports settings that you can use to customize an isolated shell application. It specifies values that are created when an application is installed on a computer and that are referenced by the Visual Studio shell when it starts the application. The settings are organized in the file based on the applicable registry keys.  

> [!WARNING]
> Note that .pkgdef files that are not declared in the .vsixmanifest file of the VSPackage are not scanned when Visual Studio starts.  

 The .pkgdef file contains sections that are each identified by a key, either `[$RootKey$]` or `[$RootKey$\`*subkey*`]`, where $RootKey$ is the root key for the application.  

 Each section contains name/value pairs that have the following format: `"`*ValueName*`"=`*Value*.  

 Values are either a string that is enclosed in quotes, or a 32-bit integer that is represented as a dword. Values have the following constraints:  

- All dword values are in hexadecimal format, for example `dword:00000001`.  

   For boolean values, 1 represents true, and 0 represents false.  

- All GUID strings are in registry format, for example, `"{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}"`.  

- All localizable resource identifiers have the form "@*resourceID*" or "#*resourceID*", where *resourceID* is the resource identifier in the application UI package, for example, `"@102"`. The application UI package is the package that is referenced in the AppLocalizationPackage setting.  

  For example,  

```  
"HideSolutionConcept"=dword:00000001  
"DefaultDebugEngine"="{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}"  
```  

 You can add comments to the .pkgdef file. A single-line comment has two slashes as the first two characters.  

 For a list of the substitution strings, see [Substitution Strings Used in .Pkgdef and .Pkgundef Files](../extensibility/substitution-strings-used-in-dot-pkgdef-and-dot-pkgundef-files.md).  

 The following sections describe specific registry values that affect the behavior of the Visual Studio shell in isolated mode. You can also define additional registry values for the application in this file.  

> [!NOTE]
> If a setting is not provided in the .pkgdef file, then no corresponding entry is made in the registry.  

## Settings  
 The following table describes the values defined under [$RootKey$].

In addition, if you define a ProgID for the application automation object, then the Visual Studio shell also registers each instance of the application in the ROT by using an item moniker of the form *progID*:*processID*, where *progID* is the ProgID of the application automation object, and *processID* is the process identifier for that instance of the application. For example, if you create a moniker as follows:<br /><br /> `CreateItemMoniker(L"!",`  *instanceString* `, &instanceMoniker)`<br /><br /> where `instanceString` is the *progID*:*processID* string. then you could use `instanceMoniker` with the ROT GetObject function to get the instance.<br /><br /> If the ThisVersionDTECLSID setting is omitted, then the application is not exposed through the Component Object Model (COM).

## Binding Path Settings  
 The [$RootKey$\BindingPaths\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}] key contains the list of directories that the shell checks for assemblies. These directories are added to the list of directories that the shell probes for private assemblies for the application.  

 By default, no binding-path entries are added to the .pkgdef file. However, the following subdirectories of the Visual Studio installation directory are automatically added to the application binding-path list in the registry.  

- Common7\IDE\  

- Common7\IDE\\\PrivateAssemblies  

- Common7\IDE\\\PublicAssemblies  

  To add a directory to the binding path, add an entry of the form "*directoryName*"="", where *directoryName* is an absolute path. For example,  

```  
[$RootKey$\BindingPaths\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}]  
"$RootFolder$\directory1"=""  
"%CommonProgramFiles%\directory2"=""  
```  

## Profile Settings  
 The following table describes the values that are defined for each associated package under [$RootKey$\Profile].  

|Name|Type|Value|  
|----------|----------|-----------|  
|AutoSaveFile|string|The directory in which the application stores auto-save files.<br /><br /> The default value is "$RootFolder$\Profiles\CurrentSettings.vssettings".|  

## Package Satellite DLL Settings  
 The following table describes the values that are defined under [$RootKey$\Packages\\{*vsPackageGuid*}\SatelliteDll] for the satellite DLL of each associated package, where *vsPackageGuid* is the GUID of the associated package.  

|Name|Type|Value|  
|----------|----------|-----------|  
|DllName|string|The file name of the DLL.<br /><br /> The default value is "*solutionName*ui.dll", where *solutionName* is the name of the application solution file.|  
|Path|string|The directory that contains the satellite DLL.<br /><br /> The default value is "$PackageFolder$".|  

## Package Menu Item Settings  
 The [$RootKey$\Menus] registry key defines UI resource files for the application.  

 Menu item values have the form "{*vsUiPackageGuid*}"=", *resourceId*, *versionNumber*", where *vsUiPackageGuid* is the GUID of the application UI package, *resourceId* is the resource identifier of the CTMENU resource that contains the UI elements, and *versionNumber* is a virtual version number for the CTMENU resource. For more information, see [Registering Interop Assembly Command Handlers](../extensibility/internals/registering-interop-assembly-command-handlers.md).  

 By default, a menu item entry is created in the .pkgdef file for the application UI package.  

 For each package that provides menu items and that is distributed as a part of the application, add a menu item entry for the package.
