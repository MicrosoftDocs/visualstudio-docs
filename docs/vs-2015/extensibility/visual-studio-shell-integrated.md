# Visual Studio Shell (Integrated)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The Visual Studio integrated shell includes the integrated development environment (IDE), debugger, and source control integration. No programming language is included. However, the integrated shell does provide a framework that allows you to add programming languages.  
  
 The Visual Studio integrated shell is actually a combination of the Visual Studio isolated shell plus an additional install which include integrated shell specific components.  Your integrated shell application should include both the isolated shell redistributable package as well as the integrated shell redistributable package, both from [Microsoft Visual Studio Shell Redistributable Packages](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/isolated-shell/).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Before you can access the isolated and integrated shell redistributable packages, you will be asked to fill out a brief customer survey.  After filling out the survey, you’ll be directed to a Visual Studio Connect page with redistributable package download links.  You can find the download links on subsequent visits to the Visual Studio Connect site under the **PROGRAMS &#124; VISUAL STUDIO 2015 INTEGRATED AND ISOLATED SHELL** tab.  
  
 If you install your integrated shell application on the same computer as a full version of Visual Studio, your application’s components will be integrated directly into Visual Studio.

## Notes  
  
#### 1. Data Tools  
 The integrated shell includes database development tools such as data extensibility support and the simplified **Solution Explorer**. However, SQL Server Express, SQL Reporting, and Crystal Reports are not included in the integrated shell.  
  
#### 2. Debugging Support  
 The integrated shell includes the same debugging engine that is included in the Community version of Visual Studio. The debugging engine includes the common debugger for managed code, and also related features, such as Run, Attach, Set Breakpoint, Edit and Continue, and others. However, the debugging engine does not support SQL Server database debugging.  
  
 Although support for native debugging is included in the basic debugger package, you cannot extend it to support additional languages.  
  
#### 3. Source Code Control Integration  
 The integrated shell provides APIs for implementing source-code control (SCC) and for providing the MSSCCI-based common source control integration components.  
  
 Although SCC integration is not a regular feature of the Pro edition of Visual Studio, SCC integration is provided in the integrated shell.  
  
#### 4. Build Support  
 The integrated shell provides build support. You can find information about builds in the [MSBuild Reference](../msbuild/msbuild-reference.md).  
  
## Features Not Included in the Integrated Shell  
 The following is a list of features that are not included in the integrated shell:  
  
- Class Designer  
  
- PreEmptive Protection - Dotfuscator  
  
- Language features  
  
- VSHost  
  
- No Visual Studio languages or their associated project templates or project item templates, are included in the integrated shell. No language-specific implementations of other features are included, for example Visual Basic code snippets.
