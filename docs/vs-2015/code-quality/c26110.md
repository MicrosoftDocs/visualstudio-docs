# C26110
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26110: Caller failing to hold lock \<lock> before calling function \<func>.  
  
 When a lock is required, make sure to clarify whether the function itself or its caller should acquire the lock. Warning C26110 is issued when there is a violation of the `_Requires_lock_held_` annotation.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, warning C26110 is generated because the annotation `_Requires_lock_held_` on function `LockRequired` states that the caller of `LockRequired` must acquire the lock before it calls `LockRequired`. Without this annotation, `LockRequired` has to acquire the lock before it accesses any shared data protected by the lock.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
    int d;  
} DATA;  
  
_Requires_lock_held_(p->cs)  
  
void LockRequired(DATA* p)  
{  
    p->d = 0;  
}  
  
void LockNotHeld(DATA* p)   
{   
    LockRequired(p); // Warning C26110   
}  
  
```
