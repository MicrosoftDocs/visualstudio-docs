# C6296
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6296: Ill-defined for-loop: Loop body only executed once  
  
 This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended. When the index is unsigned and a loop counts down from zero, its body is run only once.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f( )  
{  
   unsigned int i;  
  
   for (i = 0; i < 100; i--)  
   {  
      // code ...  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
void f( )  
{  
   unsigned int i;  
  
   for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)  
   {  
      // code ...  
   }  
}  
```
