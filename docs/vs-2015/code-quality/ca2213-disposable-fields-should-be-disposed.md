## Cause
 A type that implements <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> declares fields that are of types that also implement <xref:System.IDisposable>. The <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the field is not called by the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the declaring type.

## Rule Description
 A type is responsible for disposing of all its unmanaged resources; this is accomplished by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. This rule checks to see whether a disposable type `T` declares a field `F` that is an instance of a disposable type `FT`. For each field `F`, the rule attempts to locate a call to `FT.Dispose`. The rule searches the methods called by `T.Dispose`, and one level lower (the methods called by the methods called by `FT.Dispose`).

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on fields that are of types that implement <xref:System.IDisposable> if you are responsible for allocating and releasing the unmanaged resources held by the field.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if you are not responsible for releasing the resource held by the field, or if the call to <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> occurs at a deeper calling level than the rule checks.

## Example
 The following example shows a type `TypeA` that implements <xref:System.IDisposable> (`FT` in the previous discussion).

## Example
 The following example shows a type `TypeB` that violates this rule by declaring a field `aFieldOfADisposableType` (`F` in the previous discussion) as a disposable type (`TypeA`) and not calling <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on the field. `TypeB` corresponds to `T` in the previous discussion.
