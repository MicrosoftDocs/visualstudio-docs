# C26100
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26100: Race condition. Variable \<var> should be protected by lock \<lock>.

The `_Guarded_by_` annotation in the code specifies the lock to use to guard a shared variable. Warning C26100 is generated when the guard contract is violated.

## Example
The following example generates warning C26100 because there is a violation of the `_Guarded_by_` contract.

```
CRITICAL_SECTION gCS;

_Guarded_by_(gCS) int gData;

typedef struct _DATA {
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA;

void Safe(DATA* p) {
    EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
    p->data = 1; // OK
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
    EnterCriticalSection(&gCS);
    gData = 1; // OK
    LeaveCriticalSection(&gCS);
}

void Unsafe(DATA* p) {
    EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
    gData = 1; // Warning C26100 (wrong lock)
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
}
```

The contract violation occurs because an incorrect lock is used in the function `Unsafe`. In this case, `gCS` is the correct lock to use.

## Example
Occasionally a shared variable only has to be guarded for write access but not for read access. In that case, use the `_Write_guarded_by_` annotation, as shown in the following example.

```

CRITICAL_SECTION gCS;

_Guarded_by_(gCS) int gData;

typedef struct _DATA2 {
    _Write_guarded_by_(cs) int data;
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA2;

int Safe2(DATA2* p) {
    // OK: read does not have to be guarded
    int result = p->data;
    return result;
}

void Unsafe2(DATA2* p) {
    EnterCriticalSection(&gCS);
    // Warning C26100 (write has to be guarded by p->cs)
    p->data = 1;
    LeaveCriticalSection(&gCS);
}
```

This example also generates warning C26100 because it uses an incorrect lock in the function `Unsafe2`.
