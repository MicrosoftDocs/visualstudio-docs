## Cause
 A type implements the equality or inequality operator and does not implement the opposite operator.

## Rule Description
 There are no circumstances where either equality or inequality is applicable to instances of a type, and the opposite operator is undefined. Types typically implement the inequality operator by returning the negated value of the equality operator.

 The C# compiler issues an error for violations of this rule.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, implement both the equality and inequality operators, or remove the one that is present.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Your type will not work in a manner that is consistent with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].
