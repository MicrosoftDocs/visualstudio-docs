## Cause
 A public or protected method has a name that starts with `Get`, takes no parameters, and returns a value that is not an array.

## Rule Description
 In most cases, properties represent data and methods perform actions. Properties are accessed like fields, which makes them easier to use. A method is a good candidate to become a property if one of these conditions is present:

- Takes no arguments and returns the state information of an object.

- Accepts a single argument to set some part of the state of an object.

  Properties should behave as if they are fields; if the method cannot, it should not be changed to a property. Methods are better than properties in the following situations:

- The method performs a time-consuming operation. The method is perceivably slower than the time that is required to set or get the value of a field.

- The method performs a conversion. Accessing a field does not return a converted version of the data that it stores.

- The Get method has an observable side effect. Retrieving the value of a field does not produce any side effects.

- The order of execution is important. Setting the value of a field does not rely on the occurrence of other operations.

- Calling the method two times in succession creates different results.

- The method is static but returns an object that can be changed by the caller. Retrieving the value of a field does not allow the caller to change the data that is stored by the field.

- The method returns an array.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the method to a property.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Suppress a warning from this rule if the method meets at least one of the previously listed criteria.

## Controlling Property Expansion in the Debugger
 One reason programmers avoid using a property is because they do not want the debugger to auto-expand it. For example, the property might involve allocating a large object or calling a P/Invoke, but it might not actually have any observable side effects.

 You can prevent the debugger from auto-expanding properties by applying <xref:System.Diagnostics.DebuggerBrowsableAttribute?displayProperty=fullName>. The following example shows this attribute being applied to an instance property.

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Diagnostics

Namespace Microsoft.Samples

    Public Class TestClass

        ' [...]

        <DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)> _
        Public ReadOnly Property LargeObject() As LargeObject
            Get
                ' Allocate large object
                ' [...]
            End Get
        End Property

    End Class

End Namespace
```

```csharp

      using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Microsoft.Samples
{
    publicclass TestClass
    {
        // [...]

        [DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)]
        public LargeObject LargeObject
        {
            get
            {
                // Allocate large object
                // [...]

        }
    }
}
```

## Example
 The following example contains several methods that should be converted to properties, and several that should not because they do not behave like fields.
