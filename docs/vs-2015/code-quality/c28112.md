# C28112
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28112: A variable which is accessed via an Interlocked function must always be accessed via an Interlocked function  
  
 See line *number*: It is not always safe to access a variable which is accessed via the Interlocked* family of functions in any other way.  
  
 A variable that is accessed by using the Interlocked executive support routines, such as InterlockedCompareExchangeAcquire, is later accessed by using a different method.Although certain ordinary assignments, accesses, and comparisons to variables that are used by the Interlocked* routines can be safely accessed by using a different method, the risk is great enough to justify examining each instance.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
```  
inter_var --;  
...  
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);  
```  
  
 The following code example avoids this warning:  
  
```  
InterlockedDecrement(&inter_var);  
...  
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);  
```
