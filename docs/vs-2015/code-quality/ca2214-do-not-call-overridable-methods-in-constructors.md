## Cause
 The constructor of an unsealed type calls a virtual method defined in its class.

## Rule Description
 When a virtual method is called, the actual type that executes the method is not selected until run time. When a constructor calls a virtual method, it is possible that the constructor for the instance that invokes the method has not executed.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, do not call a type's virtual methods from within the type's constructors.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The constructor should be redesigned to eliminate the call to the virtual method.

## Example
 The following example demonstrates the effect of violating this rule. The test application creates an instance of `DerivedType`, which causes its base class (`BadlyConstructedType`) constructor to execute. `BadlyConstructedType`'s constructor incorrectly calls the virtual method `DoSomething`. As the output shows, `DerivedType.DoSomething()` executes, and does so before `DerivedType`'s constructor executes.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual/cs/FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual#1](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual/vb/FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual.vb#1)]

 This example produces the following output.

 **Calling base ctor.**
**Derived DoSomething is called - initialized ? No**
**Calling derived ctor.**
