# C28222
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning 28222: \_Yes\_, \_No\_, or \_Maybe\_ expected for annotation  
  
 This warning indicates that a parameter to an annotation is expected to be one of the symbols `_Yes_`, `_No_`, or `_Maybe_`, and some other symbol was encountered. This usually indicates an incorrectly coded annotation macro.
