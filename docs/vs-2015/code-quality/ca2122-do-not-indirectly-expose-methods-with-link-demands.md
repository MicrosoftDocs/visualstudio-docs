## Cause
 A public or protected member has a [Link Demands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a33fd5f9-2de9-4653-a4f0-d9df25082c4d) and is called by a member that does not perform any security checks.

## Rule Description
 A link demand checks the permissions of the immediate caller only. If a member `X` makes no security demands of its callers, and calls code protected by a link demand, a caller without the necessary permission can use `X` to access the protected member.

## How to Fix Violations
 Add a security [Data and Modeling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8c37635d-e2c1-4b64-a258-61d9e87405e6) or link demand to the member so that it no longer provides unsecured access to the link demand-protected member.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 To safely suppress a warning from this rule, you must make sure that your code does not grant its callers access to operations or resources that can be used in a destructive manner.

## Example
 The following examples show a library that violates the rule, and an application that demonstrates the library's weakness. The sample library provides two methods that together violate the rule. The `EnvironmentSetting` method is secured by a link demand for unrestricted access to environment variables. The `DomainInformation` method makes no security demands of its callers before it calls `EnvironmentSetting`.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Security.UnsecuredDoNotCall#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Security.UnsecuredDoNotCall/cs/FxCop.Security.UnsecuredDoNotCall.cs#1)]

## Example
 The following application calls the unsecured library member.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Security.TestUnsecuredDoNot1#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Security.TestUnsecuredDoNot1/cs/FxCop.Security.TestUnsecuredDoNot1.cs#1)]

 This example produces the following output.

 **Value from unsecured member: seattle.corp.contoso.com**
