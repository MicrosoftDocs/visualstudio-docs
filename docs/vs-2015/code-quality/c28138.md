# C28138
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28138: The constant argument should instead be variable  
  
 This warning is reported in a function call that expects a variable or a non-constant expression, but the call includes a constant. For information about the function and its parameter, consult the WDK documentation of the function.  
  
## Example  
 For example, in the following code example, the parameter of the `READ_PORT_UCHAR` macro must be a pointer to the port address, not the address provided as a constant.  
  
 The following code example generates this warning message:  
  
```  
READ_PORT_UCHAR(0x80001234);  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use a pointer to the port address.  
  
```  
READ_PORT_UCHAR(PortAddress);  
```  
  
 There are a few older devices for which a constant parameter is acceptable with the READ_PORT and WRITE_PORT family of functions. When those devices receive this warning, the warning can be suppressed or ignored. However, any new devices should not assume a constant hardware address.
