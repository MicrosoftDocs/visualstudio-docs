## Cause
 A public or protected type contains a public or protected indexer that uses more than one index.

## Rule Description
 Indexers, that is, indexed properties, should use a single index. Multi-dimensional indexers can significantly reduce the usability of the library. If the design requires multiple indexes, reconsider whether the type represents a logical data store. If not, use a method.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use a lone integer or string index, or use a method instead of the indexer.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Suppress a warning from this rule only after carefully considering the need for the nonstandard indexer.

## Example
 The following example shows a type, `DayOfWeek03`, with a multi-dimensional indexer that violates the rule. The indexer can be seen as a type of conversion and therefore is more appropriately exposed as a method. The type is redesigned in `RedesignedDayOfWeek03` to satisfy the rule.
