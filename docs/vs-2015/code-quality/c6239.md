# C6239
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6239: (\<non-zero constant> && \<expression>) always evaluates to the result of \<expression>. Did you intend to use the bitwise-and operator?  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the left side of a logical-AND operation that occurs in a test context. For example, the expression `( 2 && n )` is reduced to `(!!n)`, which is the Boolean value of `n`.  
  
 This warning typically indicates an attempt to check a bit mask in which the bitwise-AND (`&`) operator should be used, and is not generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1 because of its use for selectively choosing code paths.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
void f( int n )  
{  
   if(INPUT_TYPE && n) // warning 6239  
   {  
      puts("boolean value of n is true");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("boolean value of n is false");  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use bitwise-AND (`&`) operator as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
void f( int n )  
{  
   if( ( INPUT_TYPE & n ) )  
   {  
      puts("bitmask true");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("bitmask false");  
   }  
}  
```
