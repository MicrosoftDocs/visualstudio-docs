# C6294
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6294: Ill-defined for-loop: initial condition does not satisfy test. Loop body not executed  
  
 This warning indicates that a for-loop cannot be executed  because the terminating condition is true. This warning suggests that the programmer's intent is not correctly captured.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code generates this warning because MAX_VALUE is 0:  
  
```  
#define MAX_VALUE 0  
void f()  
{  
  int i;  
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++)  
  {  
    // code   
  }  
}  
```  
  
 The following sample code corrects this warning by changing the value of MAX_VALUE to 25  
  
```  
#define MAX_VALUE 25  
void f()  
{  
  int i;  
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++)  
  {  
    // code   
  }  
}  
```
