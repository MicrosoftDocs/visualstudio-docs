# C28236
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28236: The annotation cannot be used in an expression  
  
 This warning indicates that an attempt was made to use a function declared to be an annotation in an expression context. This should not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in typical use.
