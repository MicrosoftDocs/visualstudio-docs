# C6316
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6316: Incorrect operator: tested expression is constant and non-zero. Use bitwise-and to determine whether bits are set  
  
 This warning indicates the use of bitwise-or (`|`) when bitwise-and (`&`) should have been used. Bitwise-or adds bits to the resulting expression, whereas bitwise-and selects only those bits in common between its two operators. Tests for flags must be performed with bitwise-and or a test of equality.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#define INPUT_VALUE 2  
void f( int Flags)  
{  
  if (Flags | INPUT_VALUE) // warning  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
#define ALLOWED 1  
#define INPUT_VALUE 2  
  
void f( int Flags)  
{  
  if ((Flags & INPUT_VALUE) == ALLOWED)  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```
