# C6315
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6315: Incorrect order of operations: bitwise-and has higher precedence than bitwise-or. Add parentheses to clarify intent  
  
 This warning indicates that an expression in a test context contains both bitwise-and (`&`) and bitwise-or (`|`) operations, but causes a constant because the bitwise-or operation happens last. Parentheses should be added to clarify intent.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f( int i )  
{  
  if ( i & 2 | 4 ) // warning  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, add parenthesis as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
void f( int i )  
{  
  if ( i & ( 2 | 4 ) )  
  {  
    // code  
  }  
}  
```
