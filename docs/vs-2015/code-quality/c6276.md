# C6276
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6276: Cast between semantically different string types: char* to wchar_t\*. Use of invalid string can lead to undefined behavior  
  
 This warning indicates a potentially incorrect cast from an ANSI string (`char_t*`) to a UNICODE string (`wchar_t *`). Because UNICODE strings have a character size of 2 bytes, this cast might yield strings that are not correctly terminated. Using such strings with the wcs* library of functions could cause buffer overruns and access violations.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
VOID f()  
{  
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];  
   LPWSTR pSrc;  
  
   pSrc = (LPWSTR)"a";  
   wcscpy(szBuffer, pSrc);   
}  
```  
  
 The following code corrects this warning by appending the letter L to represent the ASCII character as a wide character:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
VOID f()  
{  
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];  
   LPWSTR pSrc;  
  
   pSrc = L"a";  
   wcscpy(szBuffer, pSrc);  
}  
```  
  
 The following code uses the safe string manipulation function, `wcscpy_s`, to correct this warning:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
VOID f()  
{  
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];  
   LPWSTR pSrc;  
   pSrc = L"a";  
   wcscpy_s(szBuffer,8,pSrc);   
}  
```
