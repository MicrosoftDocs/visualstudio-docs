# C28023
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28023: The function being assigned or passed should have a `_Function_class_` annotation for at least one of the class(es) in: \<classlist>  
  
 This warning is usually reported when only one function class is in use and a callback of the appropriate type is not declared.  
  
 This warning is issued when the function on the left side of the assignment (or of the implied assignment, if this is a function call) is annotated to indicate that it is a driver-specific function type that uses the `_Function_class_` annotation or a typedef that contains such an annotation. The function on the right side of the assignment does not have a `_Function_class_` annotation. The function on the right should be annotated to be of the same type as the function on the left. This is usually best done by adding the declaration \<class1> \<funcname1> before the current first declaration of \<funcname2>.
