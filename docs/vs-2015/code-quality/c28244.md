# C28244
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28244: The annotation for function has an unparseable parameter/external annotation  
  
 This should currently not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in typical use.
