# Code Analysis Warnings for Managed Code by CheckId
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The following table lists Code Analysis warnings for managed code by the CheckId identifier of the warning.

## Warnings

|CheckId|Warning|Description|
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
|CA1000|[CA1000: Do not declare static members on generic types](../code-quality/ca1000-do-not-declare-static-members-on-generic-types.md)|When a static member of a generic type is called, the type argument must be specified for the type. When a generic instance member that does not support inference is called, the type argument must be specified for the member. In these two cases, the syntax for specifying the type argument is different and easily confused.|
|CA1001|[CA1001: Types that own disposable fields should be disposable](../code-quality/ca1001-types-that-own-disposable-fields-should-be-disposable.md)|A class declares and implements an instance field that is a System.IDisposable type, and the class does not implement IDisposable. A class that declares an IDisposable field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource and should implement the IDisposable interface.|
|CA1002|[CA1002: Do not expose generic lists](../code-quality/ca1002-do-not-expose-generic-lists.md)|System.Collections.Generic.List<(Of \<(T>)>) is a generic collection that is designed for performance, not inheritance. Therefore, List does not contain any virtual members. The generic collections that are designed for inheritance should be exposed instead.|
|CA1003|[CA1003: Use generic event handler instances](../code-quality/ca1003-use-generic-event-handler-instances.md)|A type contains a delegate that returns void, whose signature contains two parameters (the first an object and the second a type that is assignable to EventArgs), and the containing assembly targets Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.|
|CA1004|[CA1004: Generic methods should provide type parameter](../code-quality/ca1004-generic-methods-should-provide-type-parameter.md)|Inference is how the type argument of a generic method is determined by the type of argument that is passed to the method, instead of by the explicit specification of the type argument. To enable inference, the parameter signature of a generic method must include a parameter that is of the same type as the type parameter for the method. In this case, the type argument does not have to be specified. When using inference for all type parameters, the syntax for calling generic and non-generic instance methods is identical; this simplifies the usability of generic methods.|
|CA1005|[CA1005: Avoid excessive parameters on generic types](../code-quality/ca1005-avoid-excessive-parameters-on-generic-types.md)|The more type parameters a generic type contains, the more difficult it is to know and remember what each type parameter represents. It is usually obvious with one type parameter, as in List\<T>, and in certain cases that have two type parameters, as in Dictionary\<TKey, TValue>. However, if more than two type parameters exist, the difficulty becomes too great for most users.|
|CA1006|[CA1006: Do not nest generic types in member signatures](../code-quality/ca1006-do-not-nest-generic-types-in-member-signatures.md)|A nested type argument is a type argument that is also a generic type. To call a member whose signature contains a nested type argument, the user must instantiate one generic type and pass this type to the constructor of a second generic type. The required procedure and syntax are complex and should be avoided.|
|CA1007|[CA1007: Use generics where appropriate](../code-quality/ca1007-use-generics-where-appropriate.md)|An externally visible method contains a reference parameter of type System.Object. Use of a generic method enables all types, subject to constraints, to be passed to the method without first casting the type to the reference parameter type.|
|CA1008|[CA1008: Enums should have zero value](../code-quality/ca1008-enums-should-have-zero-value.md)|The default value of an uninitialized enumeration, just as other value types, is zero. A nonflags-attributed enumeration should define a member by using the value of zero so that the default value is a valid value of the enumeration. If an enumeration that has the FlagsAttribute attribute applied defines a zero-valued member, its name should be "None" to indicate that no values have been set in the enumeration.|
|CA1009|[CA1009: Declare event handlers correctly](../code-quality/ca1009-declare-event-handlers-correctly.md)|Event handler methods take two parameters. The first is of type System.Object and is named "sender". This is the object that raised the event. The second parameter is of type System.EventArgs and is named "e". This is the data that is associated with the event. Event handler methods should not return a value; in the C# programming language, this is indicated by the return type void.|
|CA1010|[CA1010: Collections should implement generic interface](../code-quality/ca1010-collections-should-implement-generic-interface.md)|To broaden the usability of a collection, implement one of the generic collection interfaces. Then the collection can be used to populate generic collection types.|
|CA1011|[CA1011: Consider passing base types as parameters](../code-quality/ca1011-consider-passing-base-types-as-parameters.md)|When a base type is specified as a parameter in a method declaration, any type that is derived from the base type can be passed as the corresponding argument to the method. If the additional functionality that is provided by the derived parameter type is not required, use of the base type enables wider use of the method.|
|CA1012|[CA1012: Abstract types should not have constructors](../code-quality/ca1012-abstract-types-should-not-have-constructors.md)|Constructors on abstract types can be called only by derived types. Because public constructors create instances of a type, and you cannot create instances of an abstract type, an abstract type that has a public constructor is incorrectly designed.|
|CA1013|[CA1013: Overload operator equals on overloading add and subtract](../code-quality/ca1013-overload-operator-equals-on-overloading-add-and-subtract.md)|A public or protected type implements the addition or subtraction operators without implementing the equality operator.|
|CA1014|[CA1014: Mark assemblies with CLSCompliantAttribute](../code-quality/ca1014-mark-assemblies-with-clscompliantattribute.md)|The Common Language Specification (CLS) defines naming restrictions, data types, and rules to which assemblies must conform if they will be used across programming languages. Good design dictates that all assemblies explicitly indicate CLS compliance by using <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> . If this attribute is not present on an assembly, the assembly is not compliant.|
|CA1016|[CA1016: Mark assemblies with AssemblyVersionAttribute](../code-quality/ca1016-mark-assemblies-with-assemblyversionattribute.md)|The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] uses the version number to uniquely identify an assembly, and to bind to types in strongly named assemblies. The version number is used together with version and publisher policy. By default, applications run only with the assembly version with which they were built.|
|CA1017|[CA1017: Mark assemblies with ComVisibleAttribute](../code-quality/ca1017-mark-assemblies-with-comvisibleattribute.md)|ComVisibleAttribute determines how COM clients access managed code. Good design dictates that assemblies explicitly indicate COM visibility. COM visibility can be set for the whole assembly and then overridden for individual types and type members. If this attribute is not present, the contents of the assembly are visible to COM clients.|
|CA1018|[CA1018: Mark attributes with AttributeUsageAttribute](../code-quality/ca1018-mark-attributes-with-attributeusageattribute.md)|When you define a custom attribute, mark it by using AttributeUsageAttribute to indicate where in the source code the custom attribute can be applied. The meaning and intended usage of an attribute will determine its valid locations in code.|
|CA1019|[CA1019: Define accessors for attribute arguments](../code-quality/ca1019-define-accessors-for-attribute-arguments.md)|Attributes can define mandatory arguments that must be specified when you apply the attribute to a target. These are also known as positional arguments because they are supplied to attribute constructors as positional parameters. For every mandatory argument, the attribute should also provide a corresponding read-only property so that the value of the argument can be retrieved at execution time. Attributes can also define optional arguments, which are also known as named arguments. These arguments are supplied to attribute constructors by name and should have a corresponding read/write property.|
|CA1020|[CA1020: Avoid namespaces with few types](../code-quality/ca1020-avoid-namespaces-with-few-types.md)|Make sure that each of your namespaces has a logical organization, and that a valid reason exists for putting types in a sparsely populated namespace.|
|CA1021|[CA1021: Avoid out parameters](../code-quality/ca1021-avoid-out-parameters.md)|Passing types by reference (using out or ref) requires experience with pointers, understanding how value types and reference types differ, and handling methods with multiple return values. Also, the difference between out and ref parameters is not widely understood.|
|CA1023|[CA1023: Indexers should not be multidimensional](../code-quality/ca1023-indexers-should-not-be-multidimensional.md)|Indexers (that is, indexed properties) should use a single index. Multidimensional indexers can significantly reduce the usability of the library.|
|CA1024|[CA1024: Use properties where appropriate](../code-quality/ca1024-use-properties-where-appropriate.md)|A public or protected method has a name that starts with "Get", takes no parameters, and returns a value that is not an array. The method might be a good candidate to become a property.|
|CA1025|[CA1025: Replace repetitive arguments with params array](../code-quality/ca1025-replace-repetitive-arguments-with-params-array.md)|Use a parameter array instead of repeated arguments when the exact number of arguments is unknown and when the variable arguments are the same type or can be passed as the same type.|
|CA1026|[CA1026: Default parameters should not be used](../code-quality/ca1026-default-parameters-should-not-be-used.md)|Methods that use default parameters are allowed under the CLS; however, the CLS lets compilers ignore the values that are assigned to these parameters. To maintain the behavior that you want across programming languages, methods that use default parameters should be replaced by method overloads that provide the default parameters.|
|CA1027|[CA1027: Mark enums with FlagsAttribute](../code-quality/ca1027-mark-enums-with-flagsattribute.md)|An enumeration is a value type that defines a set of related named constants. Apply FlagsAttribute to an enumeration when its named constants can be meaningfully combined.|
|CA1028|[CA1028: Enum storage should be Int32](../code-quality/ca1028-enum-storage-should-be-int32.md)|An enumeration is a value type that defines a set of related named constants. By default, the System.Int32 data type is used to store the constant value. Although you can change this underlying type, it is not required or recommended for most scenarios.|
|CA1030|[CA1030: Use events where appropriate](../code-quality/ca1030-use-events-where-appropriate.md)|This rule detects methods that have names that ordinarily would be used for events. If a method is called in response to a clearly defined state change, the method should be invoked by an event handler. Objects that call the method should raise events instead of calling the method directly.|
|CA1031|[CA1031: Do not catch general exception types](../code-quality/ca1031-do-not-catch-general-exception-types.md)|General exceptions should not be caught. Catch a more specific exception, or rethrow the general exception as the last statement in the catch block.|
|CA1032|[CA1032: Implement standard exception constructors](../code-quality/ca1032-implement-standard-exception-constructors.md)|Failure to provide the full set of constructors can make it difficult to correctly handle exceptions.|
|CA1033|[CA1033: Interface methods should be callable by child types](../code-quality/ca1033-interface-methods-should-be-callable-by-child-types.md)|An unsealed externally visible type provides an explicit method implementation of a public interface and does not provide an alternative externally visible method that has the same name.|
|CA1034|[CA1034: Nested types should not be visible](../code-quality/ca1034-nested-types-should-not-be-visible.md)|A nested type is a type that is declared in the scope of another type. Nested types are useful to encapsulate private implementation details of the containing type. Used for this purpose, nested types should not be externally visible.|
|CA1035|[CA1035: ICollection implementations have strongly typed members](../code-quality/ca1035-icollection-implementations-have-strongly-typed-members.md)|This rule requires ICollection implementations to provide strongly typed members so that users are not required to cast arguments to the Object type when they use the functionality that is provided by the interface. This rule assumes that the type that implements ICollection does so to manage a collection of instances of a type that is stronger than Object.|
|CA1036|[CA1036: Override methods on comparable types](../code-quality/ca1036-override-methods-on-comparable-types.md)|A public or protected type implements the System.IComparable interface. It does not override Object.Equals nor does it overload the language-specific operator for equality, inequality, less than, or greater than.|
|CA1038|[CA1038: Enumerators should be strongly typed](../code-quality/ca1038-enumerators-should-be-strongly-typed.md)|This rule requires IEnumerator implementations to also provide a strongly typed version of the Current property so that users are not required to cast the return value to the strong type when they use the functionality that is provided by the interface.|
|CA1039|[CA1039: Lists are strongly typed](../code-quality/ca1039-lists-are-strongly-typed.md)|This rule requires IList implementations to provide strongly typed members so that users are not required to cast arguments to the System.Object type when they use the functionality that is provided by the interface.|
|CA1040|[CA1040: Avoid empty interfaces](../code-quality/ca1040-avoid-empty-interfaces.md)|Interfaces define members that provide a behavior or usage contract. The functionality that is described by the interface can be adopted by any type, regardless of where the type appears in the inheritance hierarchy. A type implements an interface by providing implementations for the members of the interface. An empty interface does not define any members; therefore, it does not define a contract that can be implemented.|
|CA1041|[CA1041: Provide ObsoleteAttribute message](../code-quality/ca1041-provide-obsoleteattribute-message.md)|A type or member is marked by using a System.ObsoleteAttribute attribute that does not have its ObsoleteAttribute.Message property specified. When a type or member that is marked by using ObsoleteAttribute is compiled, the Message property of the attribute is displayed. This gives the user information about the obsolete type or member.|
|CA1043|[CA1043: Use integral or string argument for indexers](../code-quality/ca1043-use-integral-or-string-argument-for-indexers.md)|Indexers (that is, indexed properties) should use integral or string types for the index. These types are typically used for indexing data structures and they increase the usability of the library. Use of the Object type should be restricted to those cases where the specific integral or string type cannot be specified at design time.|
|CA1044|[CA1044: Properties should not be write only](../code-quality/ca1044-properties-should-not-be-write-only.md)|Although it is acceptable and often necessary to have a read-only property, the design guidelines prohibit the use of write-only properties. This is because letting a user set a value, and then preventing the user from viewing that value, does not provide any security. Also, without read access, the state of shared objects cannot be viewed, which limits their usefulness.|
|CA1045|[CA1045: Do not pass types by reference](../code-quality/ca1045-do-not-pass-types-by-reference.md)|Passing types by reference (using out or ref) requires experience with pointers, understanding how value types and reference types differ, and handling methods that have multiple return values. Library architects who design for a general audience should not expect users to master working with out or ref parameters.|
|CA1046|[CA1046: Do not overload operator equals on reference types](../code-quality/ca1046-do-not-overload-operator-equals-on-reference-types.md)|For reference types, the default implementation of the equality operator is almost always correct. By default, two references are equal only if they point to the same object.|
|CA1047|[CA1047: Do not declare protected members in sealed types](../code-quality/ca1047-do-not-declare-protected-members-in-sealed-types.md)|Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, sealed types cannot be inherited, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.|
|CA1048|[CA1048: Do not declare virtual members in sealed types](../code-quality/ca1048-do-not-declare-virtual-members-in-sealed-types.md)|Types declare methods as virtual so that inheriting types can override the implementation of the virtual method. By definition, a sealed type cannot be inherited. This makes a virtual method on a sealed type meaningless.|
|CA1049|[CA1049: Types that own native resources should be disposable](../code-quality/ca1049-types-that-own-native-resources-should-be-disposable.md)|Types that allocate unmanaged resources should implement IDisposable to enable callers to release those resources on demand and to shorten the lifetimes of the objects that hold the resources.|
|CA1050|[CA1050: Declare types in namespaces](../code-quality/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces.md)|Types are declared in namespaces to prevent name collisions and as a way to organize related types in an object hierarchy.|
|CA1051|[CA1051: Do not declare visible instance fields](../code-quality/ca1051-do-not-declare-visible-instance-fields.md)|The primary use of a field should be as an implementation detail. Fields should be private or internal and should be exposed by using properties.|
|CA1052|[CA1052: Static holder types should be sealed](../code-quality/ca1052-static-holder-types-should-be-sealed.md)|A public or protected type contains only static members and is not declared by using the sealed (C# Reference) (NotInheritable) modifier. A type that is not meant to be inherited should be marked by using the sealed modifier to prevent its use as a base type.|
|CA1053|[CA1053: Static holder types should not have constructors](../code-quality/ca1053-static-holder-types-should-not-have-constructors.md)|A public or nested public type declares only static members and has a public or protected default constructor. The constructor is unnecessary because calling static members does not require an instance of the type. The string overload should call the uniform resource identifier (URI) overload by using the string argument for safety and security.|
|CA1054|[CA1054: URI parameters should not be strings](../code-quality/ca1054-uri-parameters-should-not-be-strings.md)|If a method takes a string representation of a URI, a corresponding overload should be provided that takes an instance of the URI class, which provides these services in a safe and secure manner.|
|CA1055|[CA1055: URI return values should not be strings](../code-quality/ca1055-uri-return-values-should-not-be-strings.md)|This rule assumes that the method returns a URI. A string representation of a URI is prone to parsing and encoding errors, and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The System.Uri class provides these services in a safe and secure manner.|
|CA1056|[CA1056: URI properties should not be strings](../code-quality/ca1056-uri-properties-should-not-be-strings.md)|This rule assumes that the property represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). A string representation of a URI is prone to parsing and encoding errors, and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The System.Uri class provides these services in a safe and secure manner.|
|CA1057|[CA1057: String URI overloads call System.Uri overloads](../code-quality/ca1057-string-uri-overloads-call-system-uri-overloads.md)|A type declares method overloads that differ only by the replacement of a string parameter with a System.Uri parameter. The overload that takes the string parameter does not call the overload that takes the URI parameter.|
|CA1058|[CA1058: Types should not extend certain base types](../code-quality/ca1058-types-should-not-extend-certain-base-types.md)|An externally visible type extends certain base types. Use one of the alternatives.|
|CA1059|[CA1059: Members should not expose certain concrete types](../code-quality/ca1059-members-should-not-expose-certain-concrete-types.md)|A concrete type is a type that has a complete implementation and therefore can be instantiated.

|CA1064|[CA1064: Exceptions should be public](../code-quality/ca1064-exceptions-should-be-public.md)|An internal exception is visible only inside its own internal scope. After the exception falls outside the internal scope, only the base exception can be used to catch the exception. If the internal exception is inherited from T:System.Exception, T:System.SystemException, or T:System.ApplicationException, the external code will not have sufficient information to know what to do with the exception.|
|CA1065|[CA1065: Do not raise exceptions in unexpected locations](../code-quality/ca1065-do-not-raise-exceptions-in-unexpected-locations.md)|A method that is not expected to throw exceptions throws an exception.|
|CA1300|[CA1300: Specify MessageBoxOptions](../code-quality/ca1300-specify-messageboxoptions.md)|To correctly display a message box for cultures that use a right-to-left reading order, the RightAlign and RtlReading members of the MessageBoxOptions enumeration must be passed to the Show method.|

The locations of these folders can have different values on different operating systems; the user can change some of the locations; and the locations are localized. The Environment.GetFolderPath method returns the locations that are associated with the Environment.SpecialFolder enumeration, localized and appropriate for the currently running computer.|
|CA1303|[CA1303: Do not pass literals as localized parameters](../code-quality/ca1303-do-not-pass-literals-as-localized-parameters.md)|An externally visible method passes a string literal as a parameter to a constructor or method in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] class library, and that string should be localizable.|
|CA1304|[CA1304: Specify CultureInfo](../code-quality/ca1304-specify-cultureinfo.md)|A method or constructor calls a member that has an overload that accepts a System.Globalization.CultureInfo parameter, and the method or constructor does not call the overload that takes the CultureInfo parameter. When a CultureInfo or System.IFormatProvider object is not supplied, the default value that is supplied by the overloaded member might not have the effect that you want in all locales.|
|CA1305|[CA1305: Specify IFormatProvider](../code-quality/ca1305-specify-iformatprovider.md)|A method or constructor calls one or more members that have overloads that accept a System.IFormatProvider parameter, and the method or constructor does not call the overload that takes the IFormatProvider parameter.

Any changes in a future version to the layout of the type or any base types will break COM clients that bind to the interface. By default, if the ClassInterfaceAttribute attribute is not specified, a dispatch-only interface is used.|
|CA1409|[CA1409: Com visible types should be creatable](../code-quality/ca1409-com-visible-types-should-be-creatable.md)|A reference type that is specifically marked as visible to COM contains a public parameterized constructor but does not contain a public default (parameterless) constructor. A type without a public default constructor is not creatable by COM clients.|
|CA1410|[CA1410: COM registration methods should be matched](../code-quality/ca1410-com-registration-methods-should-be-matched.md)|A type declares a method that is marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute attribute but does not declare a method marked by using the System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute attribute, or vice versa.|

|CA1500|[CA1500: Variable names should not match field names](../code-quality/ca1500-variable-names-should-not-match-field-names.md)|An instance method declares a parameter or a local variable whose name matches an instance field of the declaring type, leading to errors.|
|CA1501|[CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance](../code-quality/ca1501-avoid-excessive-inheritance.md)|A type is more than four levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy. Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain.|
|CA1502|[CA1502: Avoid excessive complexity](../code-quality/ca1502-avoid-excessive-complexity.md)|This rule measures the number of linearly independent paths through the method, which is determined by the number and complexity of conditional branches.|
|CA1504|[CA1504: Review misleading field names](../code-quality/ca1504-review-misleading-field-names.md)|The name of an instance field starts with "s_", or the name of a static (Shared in Visual Basic) field starts with "m_".|
|CA1505|[CA1505: Avoid unmaintainable code](../code-quality/ca1505-avoid-unmaintainable-code.md)|A type or method has a low maintainability index value. A low maintainability index indicates that a type or method is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate for redesign.|
|CA1506|[CA1506: Avoid excessive class coupling](../code-quality/ca1506-avoid-excessive-class-coupling.md)|This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains.|
|CA1600|[CA1600: Do not use idle process priority](../code-quality/ca1600-do-not-use-idle-process-priority.md)|Do not set process priority to Idle. Processes that have System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass.Idle will occupy the CPU when it would otherwise be idle, and will therefore block standby.|
|CA1601|[CA1601: Do not use timers that prevent power state changes](../code-quality/ca1601-do-not-use-timers-that-prevent-power-state-changes.md)|Higher-frequency periodic activity will keep the CPU busy and interfere with power-saving idle timers that turn off the display and hard disks.|
|CA1700|[CA1700: Do not name enum values 'Reserved'](../code-quality/ca1700-do-not-name-enum-values-reserved.md)|This rule assumes that an enumeration member that has a name that contains "reserved" is not currently used but is a placeholder to be renamed or removed in a future version. Renaming or removing a member is a breaking change.|
|CA1701|[CA1701: Resource string compound words should be cased correctly](../code-quality/ca1701-resource-string-compound-words-should-be-cased-correctly.md)|Each word in the resource string is split into tokens based on the casing. Each contiguous two-token combination is checked by the Microsoft spelling checker library. If recognized, the word produces a violation of the rule.|
|CA1702|[CA1702: Compound words should be cased correctly](../code-quality/ca1702-compound-words-should-be-cased-correctly.md)|The name of an identifier contains multiple words, and at least one of the words appears to be a compound word that is not cased correctly.|

Other type names should not use these reserved suffixes.|
|CA1712|[CA1712: Do not prefix enum values with type name](../code-quality/ca1712-do-not-prefix-enum-values-with-type-name.md)|Names of enumeration members are not prefixed by using the type name because development tools are expected to provide type information.|

|CA1716|[CA1716: Identifiers should not match keywords](../code-quality/ca1716-identifiers-should-not-match-keywords.md)|A namespace name or a type name matches a reserved keyword in a programming language. Identifiers for namespaces and types should not match keywords that are defined by languages that target the common language runtime.|
|CA1717|[CA1717: Only FlagsAttribute enums should have plural names](../code-quality/ca1717-only-flagsattribute-enums-should-have-plural-names.md)|Naming conventions dictate that a plural name for an enumeration indicates that more than one value of the enumeration can be specified at the same time.|
|CA1719|[CA1719: Parameter names should not match member names](../code-quality/ca1719-parameter-names-should-not-match-member-names.md)|A parameter name should communicate the meaning of a parameter and a member name should communicate the meaning of a member. It would be a rare design where these were the same. Naming a parameter the same as its member name is unintuitive and makes the library difficult to use.|
|CA1720|[CA1720: Identifiers should not contain type names](../code-quality/ca1720-identifiers-should-not-contain-type-names.md)|The name of a parameter in an externally visible member contains a data type name, or the name of an externally visible member contains a language-specific data type name.|

Violating this rule can reduce the usability of the library.|
|CA1725|[CA1725: Parameter names should match base declaration](../code-quality/ca1725-parameter-names-should-match-base-declaration.md)|Consistent naming of parameters in an override hierarchy increases the usability of the method overrides. A parameter name in a derived method that differs from the name in the base declaration can cause confusion about whether the method is an override of the base method or a new overload of the method.|
|CA1726|[CA1726: Use preferred terms](../code-quality/ca1726-use-preferred-terms.md)|The name of an externally visible identifier includes a term for which an alternative, preferred term exists. Alternatively, the name includes the term "Flag" or "Flags".|

Because the value that is assigned to the targeted field is computable at compile time, change the declaration to a const (Const in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) field so that the value is computed at compile time instead of at run time.|
|CA1804|[CA1804: Remove unused locals](../code-quality/ca1804-remove-unused-locals.md)|Unused local variables and unnecessary assignments increase the size of an assembly and decrease performance.|
|CA1806|[CA1806: Do not ignore method results](../code-quality/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results.md)|A new object is created but never used; or a method that creates and returns a new string is called and the new string is never used; or a COM or P/Invoke method returns an HRESULT or error code that is never used.|
|CA1809|[CA1809: Avoid excessive locals](../code-quality/ca1809-avoid-excessive-locals.md)|A common performance optimization is to store a value in a processor register instead of memory, which is referred to as "enregistering the value".

|CA1815|[CA1815: Override equals and operator equals on value types](../code-quality/ca1815-override-equals-and-operator-equals-on-value-types.md)|For value types, the inherited implementation of Equals uses the Reflection library and compares the contents of all fields. Reflection is computationally expensive, and comparing every field for equality might be unnecessary. If you expect users to compare or sort instances, or to use instances as hash table keys, your value type should implement Equals.|
|CA1816|[CA1816: Call GC.SuppressFinalize correctly](../code-quality/ca1816-call-gc-suppressfinalize-correctly.md)|A method that is an implementation of Dispose does not call GC.SuppressFinalize; or a method that is not an implementation of Dispose calls GC.SuppressFinalize; or a method calls GC.SuppressFinalize and passes something other than this (Me in Visual Basic).|
|CA1819|[CA1819: Properties should not return arrays](../code-quality/ca1819-properties-should-not-return-arrays.md)|Arrays that are returned by properties are not write-protected, even when the property is read-only. To keep the array tamper-proof, the property must return a copy of the array. Typically, users will not understand the adverse performance implications of calling such a property.|
|CA1820|[CA1820: Test for empty strings using string length](../code-quality/ca1820-test-for-empty-strings-using-string-length.md)|Comparing strings by using the String.Length property or the String.IsNullOrEmpty method is significantly faster than using Equals.|
|CA1821|[CA1821: Remove empty finalizers](../code-quality/ca1821-remove-empty-finalizers.md)|Whenever you can, avoid finalizers because of the additional performance overhead that is involved in tracking object lifetime. An empty finalizer incurs added overhead and delivers no benefit.|
|CA1822|[CA1822: Mark members as static](../code-quality/ca1822-mark-members-as-static.md)|Members that do not access instance data or call instance methods can be marked as static (Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]). After you mark the methods as static, the compiler will emit nonvirtual call sites to these members. This can give you a measurable performance gain for performance-sensitive code.|

|CA2100|[CA2100: Review SQL queries for security vulnerabilities](../code-quality/ca2100-review-sql-queries-for-security-vulnerabilities.md)|A method sets the System.Data.IDbCommand.CommandText property by using a string that is built from a string argument to the method. This rule assumes that the string argument contains user input. A SQL command string that is built from user input is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.|
|CA2101|[CA2101: Specify marshaling for P/Invoke string arguments](../code-quality/ca2101-specify-marshaling-for-p-invoke-string-arguments.md)|A platform invoke member allows partially trusted callers, has a string parameter, and does not explicitly marshal the string. This can cause a potential security vulnerability.|
|CA2102|[CA2102: Catch non-CLSCompliant exceptions in general handlers](../code-quality/ca2102-catch-non-clscompliant-exceptions-in-general-handlers.md)|A member in an assembly that is not marked by using the RuntimeCompatibilityAttribute or is marked RuntimeCompatibility(WrapNonExceptionThrows = false) contains a catch block that handles System.Exception and does not contain an immediately following general catch block.|
|CA2103|[CA2103: Review imperative security](../code-quality/ca2103-review-imperative-security.md)|A method uses imperative security and might be constructing the permission by using state information or return values that can change as long as the demand is active.

|CA2122|[CA2122: Do not indirectly expose methods with link demands](../code-quality/ca2122-do-not-indirectly-expose-methods-with-link-demands.md)|A public or protected member has Link Demands and is called by a member that does not perform any security checks. A link demand checks the permissions of the immediate caller only.|
|CA2123|[CA2123: Override link demands should be identical to base](../code-quality/ca2123-override-link-demands-should-be-identical-to-base.md)|This rule matches a method to its base method, which is either an interface or a virtual method in another type, and then compares the link demands on each.

|CA2131|[CA2131: Security critical types may not participate in type equivalence](../code-quality/ca2131-security-critical-types-may-not-participate-in-type-equivalence.md)|A type participates in type equivalence and either the type itself, or a member or field of the type, is marked by using the SecurityCriticalAttribute attribute. This rule occurs on any critical types or types that contain critical methods or fields that are participating in type equivalence. When the CLR detects such a type, it does not load it with a TypeLoadException at run time. Typically, this rule is raised only when users implement type equivalence manually instead of in by relying on tlbimp and the compilers to do the type equivalence.|

Security-critical types and members can be used only by trusted code in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] for Silverlight class library. Because a public or protected construction in a derived class must have the same or greater transparency than its base class, a class in an application cannot be derived from a class marked as SecurityCritical.|
|CA2133|[CA2133: Delegates must bind to methods with consistent transparency](../code-quality/ca2133-delegates-must-bind-to-methods-with-consistent-transparency.md)|This warning is raised on a method that binds a delegate that is marked by using the SecurityCriticalAttribute to a method that is transparent or that is marked by using the SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute.

|CA2136|[CA2136: Members should not have conflicting transparency annotations](../code-quality/ca2136-members-should-not-have-conflicting-transparency-annotations.md)|Transparency attributes are applied from code elements of larger scope to elements of smaller scope. The transparency attributes of code elements that have larger scope take precedence over transparency attributes of code elements that are contained in the first element. For example, a class that is marked by using the SecurityCriticalAttribute attribute cannot contain a method that is marked by using the SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute attribute.|
|CA2137|[CA2137: Transparent methods must contain only verifiable IL](../code-quality/ca2137-transparent-methods-must-contain-only-verifiable-il.md)|A method contains unverifiable code or returns a type by reference. This rule is raised on attempts by security transparent code to execute unverifiable microsoft intermediate language (MISL). However, the rule does not contain a full IL verifier, and instead uses heuristics to catch most violations of MSIL verification.|

A process corrupting exception is a CLR version 4.0 exception classification of exceptions such as AccessViolationException. The HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute attribute may be used only by security critical methods, and will be ignored if it is applied to a transparent method.|
|CA2140|[CA2140: Transparent code must not reference security critical items](../code-quality/ca2140-transparent-code-must-not-reference-security-critical-items.md)|A code element that is marked by using the SecurityCriticalAttribute attribute is security critical.

If a transparent type attempts to use a security critical type, a TypeAccessException, MethodAccessException, or FieldAccessException is raised.|
|CA2141|[CA2141:Transparent methods must not satisfy LinkDemands](../code-quality/ca2141-transparent-methods-must-not-satisfy-linkdemands.md)|A security transparent method calls a method in an assembly that is not marked by using the APTCA, or a security transparent method satisfies a LinkDemand for a type or a method.|
|CA2142|[CA2142: Transparent code should not be protected with LinkDemands](../code-quality/ca2142-transparent-code-should-not-be-protected-with-linkdemands.md)|This rule is raised on transparent methods that require LinkDemands to access them.

|CA2143|[CA2143: Transparent methods should not use security demands](../code-quality/ca2143-transparent-methods-should-not-use-security-demands.md)|Security transparent code should not be responsible for verifying the security of an operation, and therefore should not demand permissions. Security transparent code should use full demands to make security decisions and safe-critical code should not rely on transparent code to have made the full demand.|
|CA2144|[CA2144: Transparent code should not load assemblies from byte arrays](../code-quality/ca2144-transparent-code-should-not-load-assemblies-from-byte-arrays.md)|The security review for transparent code is not as complete as the security review for critical code because transparent code cannot perform security sensitive actions. Assemblies that are loaded from a byte array might not be noticed in transparent code, and that byte array might contain critical, or more important safe-critical code, that does have to be audited.|

This LinkDemand requires that the calling code be security critical. Marking the method that uses SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity by using the SecurityCriticalAttribute attribute makes this requirement more obvious for callers of the method.|

Violations of this rule lead to a MethodAccessException in the level 2 transparency model and a full demand for UnmanagedCode in the level 1 transparency model.|
|CA2151|[CA2151: Fields with critical types should be security critical](../code-quality/ca2151-fields-with-critical-types-should-be-security-critical.md)|To use security critical types, the code that references the type must be either security critical or security safe critical. This is true even if the reference is indirect. Therefore, having a security transparent or security safe critical field is misleading because transparent code will still be unable to access the field.|
|CA2200|[CA2200: Rethrow to preserve stack details](../code-quality/ca2200-rethrow-to-preserve-stack-details.md)|An exception is rethrown and the exception is explicitly specified in the throw statement. If an exception is rethrown by specifying the exception in the throw statement, the list of method calls between the original method that threw the exception and the current method is lost.|
|CA2201|[CA2201: Do not raise reserved exception types](../code-quality/ca2201-do-not-raise-reserved-exception-types.md)|This makes the original error difficult to detect and debug.|

|CA2208|[CA2208: Instantiate argument exceptions correctly](../code-quality/ca2208-instantiate-argument-exceptions-correctly.md)|A call is made to the default (parameterless) constructor of an exception type that is or derives from ArgumentException, or an incorrect string argument is passed to a parameterized constructor of an exception type that is or derives from ArgumentException.|
|CA2210|[CA2210: Assemblies should have valid strong names](../code-quality/ca2210-assemblies-should-have-valid-strong-names.md)|The strong name protects clients from unknowingly loading an assembly that has been tampered with. Assemblies without strong names should not be deployed outside very limited scenarios. If you share or distribute assemblies that are not correctly signed, the assembly can be tampered with, the common language runtime might not load the assembly, or the user might have to disable verification on his or her computer.|
|CA2211|[CA2211: Non-constant fields should not be visible](../code-quality/ca2211-non-constant-fields-should-not-be-visible.md)|Static fields that are neither constants nor read-only are not thread-safe.

|CA2212|[CA2212: Do not mark serviced components with WebMethod](../code-quality/ca2212-do-not-mark-serviced-components-with-webmethod.md)|A method in a type that inherits from System.EnterpriseServices.ServicedComponent is marked by using System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute. Because WebMethodAttribute and a ServicedComponent method have conflicting behavior and requirements for context and transaction flow, the behavior of the method will be incorrect in some scenarios.|
|CA2213|[CA2213: Disposable fields should be disposed](../code-quality/ca2213-disposable-fields-should-be-disposed.md)|A type that implements System.IDisposable declares fields that are of types that also implement IDisposable.

|CA2214|[CA2214: Do not call overridable methods in constructors](../code-quality/ca2214-do-not-call-overridable-methods-in-constructors.md)|When a constructor calls a virtual method, the constructor for the instance that invokes the method may not have executed.|
|CA2215|[CA2215: Dispose methods should call base class dispose](../code-quality/ca2215-dispose-methods-should-call-base-class-dispose.md)|If a type inherits from a disposable type, it must call the Dispose method of the base type from its own Dispose method.|
|CA2216|[CA2216: Disposable types should declare finalizer](../code-quality/ca2216-disposable-types-should-declare-finalizer.md)|A type that implements System.IDisposable and has fields that suggest the use of unmanaged resources does not implement a finalizer, as described by Object.Finalize.|
|CA2217|[CA2217: Do not mark enums with FlagsAttribute](../code-quality/ca2217-do-not-mark-enums-with-flagsattribute.md)|An externally visible enumeration is marked by using FlagsAttribute, and it has one or more values that are not powers of two or a combination of the other defined values on the enumeration.|
|CA2218|[CA2218: Override GetHashCode on overriding Equals](../code-quality/ca2218-override-gethashcode-on-overriding-equals.md)|GetHashCode returns a value, based on the current instance, that is suited for hashing algorithms and data structures such as a hash table. Two objects that are the same type and are equal must return the same hash code.|
|CA2219|[CA2219: Do not raise exceptions in exception clauses](../code-quality/ca2219-do-not-raise-exceptions-in-exception-clauses.md)|When an exception is raised in a finally or fault clause, the new exception hides the active exception.

|CA2241|[CA2241: Provide correct arguments to formatting methods](../code-quality/ca2241-provide-correct-arguments-to-formatting-methods.md)|The format argument that is passed to System.String.Format does not contain a format item that corresponds to each object argument, or vice versa.|
|CA2242|[CA2242: Test for NaN correctly](../code-quality/ca2242-test-for-nan-correctly.md)|This expression tests a value against Single.Nan or Double.Nan. Use Single.IsNan(Single) or Double.IsNan(Double) to test the value.|
|CA2243|[CA2243: Attribute string literals should parse correctly](../code-quality/ca2243-attribute-string-literals-should-parse-correctly.md)|The string literal parameter of an attribute does not parse correctly for a URL, a GUID, or a version.|
|CA5122|[CA5122 P/Invoke declarations should not be safe critical](../code-quality/ca5122-p-invoke-declarations-should-not-be-safe-critical.md)|Methods are marked as SecuritySafeCritical when they perform a security sensitive operation, but are also safe to be used by transparent code. Transparent code may never directly call native code through a P/Invoke. Therefore, marking a P/Invoke as security safe critical will not enable transparent code to call it, and is misleading for security analysis.|
