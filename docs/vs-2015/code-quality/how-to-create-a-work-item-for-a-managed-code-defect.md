# How to: Create a Work Item for a Managed Code Defect
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can use the work item tracking feature to log work item from within [!INCLUDE[vsPreLong](../includes/vsprelong-md.md)]. To use this feature, your project must be part of Team Project in [!INCLUDE[esprfound](../includes/esprfound-md.md)].

### To create a work item for managed code defect

1. In the **Code Analysis** window, select  the warning.

2. Choose **Actions**, then choose **Create Work Item** and choose the type of work item to create.

     A new work item is created for you to specify the defect information.

### To create a work item for multiple managed code defects

1. In the **Error List**, select multiple warnings, and then right-click the warnings.

2. Point to **Create Work Item** and click the type of work item to create.

     A single work item is created for all the selected warnings for you to specify the bug information.
