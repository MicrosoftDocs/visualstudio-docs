# How to: Run Code Analysis Manually for Managed Code
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The code analysis tool provides information to you about possible defects in your source code. You can run code analysis automatically with each build of a code project, and you can also run code analysis manually. The rules that are checked when code analysis is run are specified on the Code Analysis page of the project property pages. For more information, see [How to: Configure Code Analysis for a Managed Code Project](../code-quality/how-to-configure-code-analysis-for-a-managed-code-project.md)

### To run code analysis manually

1. In **Solution Explorer**, click the project.

2. On the **Analyze** menu, click **Run Code Analysis on** *Project Name*.
