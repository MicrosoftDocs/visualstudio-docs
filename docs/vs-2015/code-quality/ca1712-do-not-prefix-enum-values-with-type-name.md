## Cause
 An enumeration contains a member whose name starts with the type name of the enumeration.

## Rule Description
 Names of enumeration members are not prefixed with the type name because type information is expected to be provided by development tools.

 Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This reduces the time that is required for to learn a new software library, and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the type name prefix from the enumeration member.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
 The following example shows an incorrectly named enumeration followed by the corrected version.
