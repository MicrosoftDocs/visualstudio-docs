# C28196
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28196: The requirement is not satisfied. (The expression does not evaluate to true.)  
  
 This warning indicates that the function prototype for the function being analyzed has a `__notnull`, `__null` or `__drv_valueIs` on an `_Out_` parameter or the return value, but the value returned is inconsistent with that annotation.
