# C6517
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6517: Invalid annotation: 'SAL_readableTo' property may not be specified on buffers that are not readable: '*Param\\*(1)'.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This warning occurs only in code that is using a deprecated version of the source-code annotation language (SAL). We recommend that you port your code to use the latest version of SAL. For more information, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).  
  
 This warning indicates that `SAL_readableTo` property does not have the required read access. You cannot use this property to annotate a parameter without providing read access.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because read access is not granted on the buffer:  
  
```cpp  
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>  
using namespace vc_attributes;  
void f([Pre( ValidBytesConst=10 )][Pre( Deref=1, Access=Write )] char* buffer );  
  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, grant read access as shown in the following code:  
  
```cpp  
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>  
using namespace vc_attributes;  
void f([Pre( ValidBytesConst=10 )][Pre( Deref=1, Access=Read)] char* buffer );  
```
