# C26130
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26130: Missing annotation \_Requires_lock_held\_(\<lock>) or \_No_competing_thread\_ at function \<func>. Otherwise it could be a race condition. Variable \<var> should be protected by lock \<lock>.  
  
 Warning C26130 is issued when the analyzer detects a potential race condition but infers that the function is likely to be run in a single threaded mode, for example, when the function is in the initialization stage based on certain heuristics.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, warning C26130 is generated because a `_Guarded_by_` member is being modified without a lock.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;  
} DATA;  
  
void Init(DATA* p)   
{  
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130  
}  
  
```  
  
## Example  
 If the previous code is guaranteed to be operated in a single threaded mode, annotate the function by using `_No_competing_thread_`, as shown in the following example.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;  
} DATA;  
  
_No_competing_thread_ void Init(DATA* p)   
{  
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130 will be resolved  
}  
  
```  
  
## Example  
 Alternatively, you can annotate a code fragment by using `_No_competing_thread_begin_` and `_No_competing_thread_end_`, as follows.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;  
} DATA;  
  
void Init(DATA* p)   
{  
    _No_competing_thread_begin_  
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130 will be resolved  
    _No_competing_thread_end_  
}  
  
```
