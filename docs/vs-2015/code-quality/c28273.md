# C28273
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28273: For function, the clues are inconsistent with the function declaration  
  
 This warning indicates an error in the annotations, not in the code that is being analyzed. The annotations appearing on a function definition are inconsistent with those appearing on a declaration. The two annotations should be resolved to match.
