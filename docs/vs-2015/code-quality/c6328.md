# C6328
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6328: Size mismatch: \<type> passed as parameter \<number> when \<type> is required in call to \<function>  
  
 For C runtime character-based routines in the family name `is`*xxx*`()`, passing an argument of type `char` can have unpredictable results. For example, an SBCS or MBCS single-byte character of type `char` with a value greater than `0x7F` is a negative value. If a `char` is passed, the compiler might convert the value to a signed `int` or a signed `long`. This value could be sign-extended by the compiler, with unexpected results. For example, `isspace` accepts an argument of type `int`; however, the valid range of values for its input argument is:  
  
 `0 <= c <= 255`, plus the special value `EOF`.  
  
## Example  
 By default, `char` is a signed type in Visual C++, so the range of values of a variable of type char is `-128 <= c <= 127`. Therefore, if you did the following:  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
  
void f( )  
{  
    char c = -37;  
    int retVal = isspace( c );  
    // code ...  
}  
  
```  
  
 `c` would be sign-extended to a signed `int` with a value of -37, which is outside the valid range for [isspace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3ac254c4-92aa-4238-882a-3a3fb576cdf5).  
  
 To correct this problem, you can use `static_cast`, as shown in the following code:  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
  
void f( )  
{  
    char c = -37;  
    int retVal = isspace( static_cast<unsigned char> (c) );  
    // code ...  
}  
  
```  
  
 Warning C6328 exists specifically to catch this bug. For characters in the 7-bit ASCII range the cast is unnecessary, but characters outside that range can have unpredictable results, up to and including program fault and termination.
