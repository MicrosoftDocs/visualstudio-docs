## Cause
 A public type is abstract and has a public constructor.

## Rule Description
 Constructors on abstract types can be called only by derived types. Because public constructors create instances of a type, and you cannot create instances of an abstract type, an abstract type that has a public constructor is incorrectly designed.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, either make the constructor protected or do not declare the type as abstract.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The abstract type has a public constructor.

## Example
 The following example contains an abstract type that violates this rule.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad/cs/FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad/vb/FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad.vb#1)]

## Example
 The following example fixes the previous violation by changing the accessibility of the constructor from `public` to `protected`.
