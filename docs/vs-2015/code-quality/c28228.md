# C28228
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28228: Annotation parameter: cannot use type in annotations  
  
 This warning indicates that a parameter is of type that is not supported. Annotations can only use a limited set of types as parameters. This should not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in typical use.
