## Cause
 The name of a public or protected member starts with 'Get' and otherwise matches the name of a public or protected property. For example, a type that contains a method that is named 'GetColor' and a property that is named 'Color' violates this rule.

## Rule Description
 Get methods and properties should have names that clearly distinguish their function.

 Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This reduces the time that is required to learn a new software library, and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

## How to Fix Violations
 Change the name so that it does not match the name of a method that is prefixed with 'Get'.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

> [!NOTE]
> This warning may be excluded if the Get method is caused by implementing IExtenderProvider interface.

## Example
 The following example contains a method and property that violate this rule.
