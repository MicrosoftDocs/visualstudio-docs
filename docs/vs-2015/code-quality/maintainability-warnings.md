# Maintainability Warnings
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Maintainability warnings support library and application maintenance.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Rule|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CA1500: Variable names should not match field names](../code-quality/ca1500-variable-names-should-not-match-field-names.md)|An instance method declares a parameter or a local variable whose name matches an instance field of the declaring type, which leads to errors.|  
|[CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance](../code-quality/ca1501-avoid-excessive-inheritance.md)|A type is more than four levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy. Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain.|  
|[CA1502: Avoid excessive complexity](../code-quality/ca1502-avoid-excessive-complexity.md)|This rule measures the number of linearly independent paths through the method, which is determined by the number and complexity of conditional branches.|  
|[CA1504: Review misleading field names](../code-quality/ca1504-review-misleading-field-names.md)|The name of an instance field starts with "s_", or the name of a static (Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) field starts with "m_".|  
|[CA1505: Avoid unmaintainable code](../code-quality/ca1505-avoid-unmaintainable-code.md)|A type or method has a low maintainability index value. A low maintainability index indicates that a type or method is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate for redesign.|  
|[CA1506: Avoid excessive class coupling](../code-quality/ca1506-avoid-excessive-class-coupling.md)|This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains.|
