## Cause
 A public or nested public reference type overloads the equality operator.

## Rule Description
 For reference types, the default implementation of the equality operator is almost always correct. By default, two references are equal only if they point to the same object.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the implementation of the equality operator.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the reference type behaves like a built-in value type. If it is meaningful to do addition or subtraction on instances of the type, it is probably correct to implement the equality operator and suppress the violation.

## Example
 The following example demonstrates the default behavior when comparing two references.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.RefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.RefTypesNoEqualityOp/cs/FxCop.Design.RefTypesNoEqualityOp.cs#1)]

## Example
 The following application compares some references.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.TestRefTypesNoEqualityOp#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.TestRefTypesNoEqualityOp/cs/FxCop.Design.TestRefTypesNoEqualityOp.cs#1)]

 This example produces the following output.

 **a = new (2,2) and b = new (2,2) are equal? No**
**c and a are equal? Yes**
**b and a are == ? No**
**c and a are == ? Yes**
