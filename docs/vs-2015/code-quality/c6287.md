# C6287
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6287: redundant code: the left and right sub-expressions are identical  
  
 This warning indicates that a redundant element was detected in an expression.  
  
 It is difficult to judge the severity of this problem without examining the code. A duplicate test on its own is harmless, but the consequences of deleting the second test can be severe. The code should be inspected to ensure that a test was not omitted.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f(int x)  
{  
  if ((x == 1) && (x == 1))   
  {  
    //logic   
  }  
  if ((x != 1) || (x != 1))  
  {  
    //logic  
  }  
}  
```  
  
 The following code shows various methods to correct this warning:  
  
```  
void f(int x, int y)  
{  
  /* Remove the redundant sub-expression: */  
  if (x == 1)   
  {  
     // logic   
  }  
  if (x != 1)   
  {  
    // logic  
  }  
  /* or test the missing variable: */  
  if ((x == 1) && (y == 1))  
  {  
     // logic  
  }  
  if ((x != 1) || (y != 1))  
  {  
     // logic  
  }  
}  
```
