## Cause
 A value type overrides <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> but does not implement the equality operator.

## Rule Description
 In most programming languages there is no default implementation of the equality operator (==) for value types. If your programming language supports operator overloads, you should consider implementing the equality operator. Its behavior should be identical to that of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>.

 You cannot use the default equality operator in an overloaded implementation of the equality operator. Doing so will cause a stack overflow. To implement the equality operator, use the Object.Equals method in your implementation. For example:

```vb
If (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, Nothing)) Then
    Return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, Nothing)
Else
    Return left.Equals(right)
End If
```

```csharp
if (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, null))
    return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, null);
return left.Equals(right);
```

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, implement the equality operator.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule; however, we recommend that you provide the equality operator if possible.

## Example
 The following example defines a type that violates this rule.
