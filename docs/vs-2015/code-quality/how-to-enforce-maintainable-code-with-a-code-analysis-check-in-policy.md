# How to: Enforce Maintainable Code with a Code Analysis Check-in Policy
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Developers can use the Code Metrics tool to measure the complexity and maintainability of their code, but they cannot invoke code metrics as part of a check-in policy. However, a team  can enable Code Analysis rules that verify the compliance of their code with Code Metrics standards and enforce the rules through check-in policies. For more information about code metrics, see the [Code Metrics Values](../code-quality/code-metrics-values.md).  
  
 Developers can enable the Depth of Inheritance, Class Coupling, Maintainability Index, and Complexity rules to enforce maintainable code through Code Analysis check-in policies. All four of these rules are found under the "Maintainability Rules" category in the Code Analysis policy editor.  
  
 Administrators of version control for [!INCLUDE[esprfound](../includes/esprfound-md.md)] can add the Code Analysis Maintainability Rules to the check-in policy requirements. These check-in policies require developers to run Code Analysis based on these rule changes before initiating a check-in.  
  
### To open the Code Analysis Policy Editor  
  
1. In **Team Explorer**, right-click the team project, click **Team Project Settings**, and then click **Source Control**.  
  
     The **Source Control** dialog box appears.  
  
2. On the **Check-in Policy** tab, and click **Add**.  
  
     The **Add Check-in Policy** dialog box appears.  
  
3. In the **Check-in Policy** list, select the **Code Analysis** check box, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The **Code Analysis Policy Editor** dialog box appears.  
  
### To enable Code Analysis Maintainability Rules  
  
1. In the **Code Analysis Policy Editor** dialog box, under **Rule Settings**, expand the **Maintainability Rules** node.  
  
2. Select the check boxes for the following rules:  
  
    - Depth of Inheritance: **CA1501 AvoidExcessiveInheritance** - Threshold: Warning at more than 5 levels deep  
  
    - Complexity: **CA1502 AvoidExcessiveComplexity** - Threshold: Warning at more than 25  
  
    - Maintainability Index: **CA1505 AvoidUnmaintainableCode** - Threshold: Warning at fewer than 20  
  
    - Class Coupling: **CA1506 AvoidExcessiveClassCoupling** - Threshold: Warning at more than 80 for a class and more than 30 for a method  
  
    - In addition, if you want a rule violation to prevent a build, select the **Treat Warning As An Error** check box next to the rule description.  
  
3. Click **OK**. The new check-in policy now applies to future check-ins.
