# C6258
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6258: using TerminateThread does not allow proper thread clean up.  
  
 This warning indicates that a call to TerminateThread has been detected.  
  
 TerminateThread is a dangerous function that should only be used in the most extreme cases. For more information about problems associated with TerminateThread call, see this topic in the MSDN Library: [TerminateThread](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms686717(VS.85).aspx).  
  
### To properly terminate threads  
  
1. Create an event object using the `CreateEvent` function.  
  
2. Create the threads.  
  
3. Each thread monitors the event state by calling the `WaitForSingleObject` function.  
  
4. Each thread ends its own execution when the event is set to the signaled state (`WaitForSingleObject` returns `WAIT_OBJECT_0`).
