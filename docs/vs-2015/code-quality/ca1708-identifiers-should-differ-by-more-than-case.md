# CA1708: Identifiers should differ by more than case

## Cause
 The names of two types, members, parameters, or fully qualified namespaces are identical when they are converted to lowercase.

## Rule Description
 Identifiers for namespaces, types, members, and parameters cannot differ only by case because languages that target the common language runtime are not required to be case-sensitive. For example, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] is a widely used case-insensitive language.

 This rule fires on publicly visible members only.

## How to Fix Violations
 Select a name that is unique when it is compared to other identifiers in a case-insensitive manner.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The library might not be usable in all available languages in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].

## Example of a Violation
 The following example demonstrates a violation of this rule.

 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Naming.IdentifiersShouldDifferByMoreThanCase#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Naming.IdentifiersShouldDifferByMoreThanCase/cs/FxCop.Naming.IdentifiersShouldDifferByMoreThanCase.cs#1)]
