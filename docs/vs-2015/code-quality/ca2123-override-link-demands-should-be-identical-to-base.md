## Cause
 A public or protected method in a public type overrides a method or implements an interface, and does not have the same [Link Demands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a33fd5f9-2de9-4653-a4f0-d9df25082c4d) as the interface or virtual method.

## Rule Description
 This rule matches a method to its base method, which is either an interface or a virtual method in another type, and then compares the link demands on each. A violation is reported if either the method or the base method has a link demand and the other does not.

 If this rule is violated, a malicious caller can bypass the link demand merely by calling the unsecured method.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, apply the same link demand to the overide method or implementation. If this is not possible, mark the method with a full demand or remove the attribute altogether.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
 The following example shows various violations of this rule.
