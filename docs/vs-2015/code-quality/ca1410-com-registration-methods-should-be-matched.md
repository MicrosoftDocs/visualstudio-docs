# CA1410: COM registration methods should be matched

|CheckId|CA1410|
|Category|Microsoft.Interoperability|
|Breaking Change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
 A type declares a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute but does not declare a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute, or vice versa.

## Rule Description
 For Component Object Model (COM) clients to create a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] type, the type must first be registered. If it is available, a method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute> attribute is called during the registration process to run user-specified code. A corresponding method that is marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute> attribute is called during the unregistration process to reverse the operations of the registration method.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, add the corresponding registration or unregistration method.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
 The following example shows a type that violates the rule. The commented code shows the fix for the violation.
