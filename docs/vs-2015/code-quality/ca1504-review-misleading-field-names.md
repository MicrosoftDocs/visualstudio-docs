# CA1504: Review misleading field names

## Cause
 The name of an instance field starts with "s_" or the name of a `static` (`Shared` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) field starts with "m_".

## Rule Description
 Field names that start with "s_" are associated with static data by many users. Similarly, field names that start with "m_" are associated with instance (member) data. For more easily maintained code, names should follow generally used conventions.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field by using the appropriate prefix. Alternatively, make the field agree with the current suffix by adding or removing the `static` modifier.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
