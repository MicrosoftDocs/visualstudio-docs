# C28303
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28303: For C++ reference-parameter <parameter_name>, an ambiguous `_Deref_` operator was found on \<annotation>.  
  
 This warning similar to warning C28302 and is reported when an extra level of `_Deref_` is used on a parameter.  
  
 SAL2 does not require the use of an extra level of `_Deref_` when dealing with reference parameters. This particular annotation is ambiguous as to which level of dereference is intended to be annotated. It may be necessary to use `_At_` to reference the specific object to be annotated.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because the use of `__deref_out_ecount(n)` is ambiguous:  
  
```  
void ref(__deref_out_ecount(n) int **&buff, int &n)  
```  
  
 The above annotation could be interpreted either as:  
  
- a reference to an array (of n) pointers to integers (SAL1 interpretation)  
  
- a reference to a pointer to an array (of n) integers (SAL2 interpretation)  
  
  Either of the following can correct this warning:  
  
```  
void ref(_Out_writes_(n) int **&buff, int &n)  
// or  
_At_(*buff), _Out_writes(n)) void ref(int **&buff, int &n)  
  
```
