# C6302
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6302: format string mismatch: character string passed as parameter \<number> when wide character string is required in call to \<function>  
  
 This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a wide character string is required. However, a character string is being passed. This defect is likely to cause a crash or a corruption of some form.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code generates this warning because a character string is passed to `wprintf` function:  
  
```  
#include<stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  char buff[5] = "hi";  
  
  wprintf(L"%s", buff);  
}  
```  
  
 The following sample code uses `%hs` to specify a single-byte character string with `wprintf` function:  
  
```  
#include<stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  char buff[5] = "hi";  
  
  wprintf(L"%hs", buff);  
}  
```  
  
 The following sample code uses safe string manipulation function `wprintf_s` to correct this warning:  
  
```  
#include<stdio.h>  
  
void f()  
{  
  char buff[5] = "hi";  
  
  wprintf_s(L"%hs", buff);  
}  
```
