# C28215
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28215: The typefix cannot be applied to a parameter that already has a typefix  
  
 Applying a `__typefix` annotation to a parameter that already has that annotation is an error. The `__typefix` annotations are used only in a few special cases and this warning is not expected to be seen in normal use.
