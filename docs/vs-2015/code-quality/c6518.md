# C6518
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6518: Invalid annotation: 'SAL_writableTo' property may not be specified as a precondition on buffers that are not writable: '*Param\\*(1)'  
  
 This warning indicates that a conflict exists between a `SAL_writableTo` property value and a writable property. This ordinarily indicates that a writable property does not have write access to the parameter being annotated.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because the `_Out_` annotation compiles to include a `SAL_writableTo` property, which does not allow write access:  
  
```cpp  
#include <sal.h>  
void f(_Out_ const char* pc)  
{  
    //code that can't write to *pc ...  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```cpp  
#include <sal.h>  
void f(_Out_  char* pc)  
{  
    pc = "Hello World";  
    //code ...  
}  
```
