## Cause
 An externally visible type has an externally visible instance field.

## Rule Description
 The primary use of a field should be as an implementation detail. Fields should be `private` or `internal` and should be exposed by using properties. It is as easy to access a property as it is to access a field, and the code in the accessors of a property can change as the features of the type expand without introducing breaking changes. Properties that just return the value of a private or internal field are optimized to perform on par with accessing a field; very little performance gain is associated with the use of externally visible fields over properties.

 Externally visible refers to `public`, `protected`, and `protected internal` (`Public`, `Protected`, and `Protected Friend` in Visual Basic) accessibility levels.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, make the field `private` or `internal` and expose it by using an externally visible property.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Externally visible fields do not provide any benefits that are unavailable to properties. Additionally, public fields cannot be protected by [Link Demands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a33fd5f9-2de9-4653-a4f0-d9df25082c4d). See [CA2112: Secured types should not expose fields](../code-quality/ca2112-secured-types-should-not-expose-fields.md).

## Example
 The following example shows a type (`BadPublicInstanceFields`) that violates this rule. `GoodPublicInstanceFields` shows the corrected code.
