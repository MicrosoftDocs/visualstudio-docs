## Cause
 A public or nested public type declares only static members and has a public or protected default constructor.

## Rule Description
 The constructor is unnecessary because calling static members does not require an instance of the type. Also, because the type does not have non-static members, creating an instance does not provide access to any of the type's members.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the default constructor or make it private.

> [!NOTE]
> Some compilers automatically create a public default constructor if the type does not define any constructors. If this is the case with your type, add a private default constructor to eliminate the violation.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The presence of the constructor suggests that the type is not a static type.

## Example
 The following example shows a type that violates this rule. Notice that there is no default constructor in the source code. When this code is compiled into an assembly, the C# compiler will insert a default constructor, which will violate this rule. To correct this, declare a private constructor.
