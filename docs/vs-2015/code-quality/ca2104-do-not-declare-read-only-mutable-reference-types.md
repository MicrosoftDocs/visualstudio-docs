## Cause
 An externally visible type contains an externally visible read-only field that is a mutable reference type.

## Rule Description
 A mutable type is a type whose instance data can be modified. The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder?displayProperty=fullName> class is an example of a mutable reference type. It contains members that can change the value of an instance of the class. An example of an immutable reference type is the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName> class. After it has been instantiated, its value can never change.

 The read-only modifier ([readonly](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2f8081f6-0de2-4903-898d-99696c48d2f4) in C#, [ReadOnly](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e868185d-6142-4359-a2fd-a7965cadfce8) in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], and [const](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b21c0271-1ad0-40a0-b21c-5e812bba0318) in C++) on a reference type field (pointer in C++) prevents the field from being replaced by a different instance of the reference type. However, the modifier does not prevent the instance data of the field from being modified through the reference type.

 Read-only array fields are exempt from this rule but instead cause a violation of the [CA2105: Array fields should not be read only](../code-quality/ca2105-array-fields-should-not-be-read-only.md) rule.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, remove the read-only modifier or, if a breaking change is acceptable, replace the field with an immutable type.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the field type is immutable.

## Example
 The following example shows a field declaration that causes a violation of this rule.
