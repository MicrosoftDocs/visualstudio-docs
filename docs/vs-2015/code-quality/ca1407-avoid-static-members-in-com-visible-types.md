## Cause
 A type that is specifically marked as visible to Component Object Model (COM) contains a `public``static` method.

## Rule Description
 COM does not support `static` methods.

 This rule ignores property and event accessors, operator overloading methods, or methods that are marked by using either the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute or the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute.

 By default, the following are visible to COM: assemblies, public types, public instance members in public types, and all members of public value types.

 For this rule to occur, an assembly-level <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> must be set to `false` and the class- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute> must be set to `true`, as the following code shows.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

[assembly: ComVisible(false)]
namespace Samples
{
    [ComVisible(true)]
    public class MyClass
    {
        public static void DoSomething()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use an instance method that provides the same functionality as the `static` method.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if a COM client does not require access to the functionality that is provided by the `static` method.

## Example Violation

### Description
 The following example shows a `static` method that violates this rule.

### Code
 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Interoperability.ComVisibleStaticMembersViolation#1](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Interoperability.ComVisibleStaticMembersViolation/cs/FxCop.Interoperability.ComVisibleStaticMembersViolation.cs#1)]

### Comments
 In this example, the **Book.FromPages** method cannot be called from COM.

## Example Fix

### Description
 To fix the violation in the previous example, you could change the method to an instance method, but that does not make sense in this instance. A better solution is to explicitly apply `ComVisible(false)` to the method to make it clear to other developers that the method cannot be seen from COM.

 The following example applies <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComRegisterFunctionAttribute> to the method.
