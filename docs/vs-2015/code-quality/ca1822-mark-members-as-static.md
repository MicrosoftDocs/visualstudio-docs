# CA1822: Mark members as static
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

For the latest documentation on Visual Studio, see [CA1822: Mark members as static](/visualstudio/code-quality/ca1822-mark-members-as-static).

|Breaking Change|Non-breaking - If the member is not visible outside the assembly, regardless of the change you make.<br /><br /> Non-breaking - If you just change the member to an instance member with the `this` keyword.<br /><br /> Breaking - If you change the member from an instance member to a static member and it is visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause
 A member that does not access instance data is not marked as static (Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]).

## Rule Description
 Members that do not access instance data or call instance methods can be marked as static (Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]). After you mark the methods as static, the compiler will emit nonvirtual call sites to these members. Emitting nonvirtual call sites will prevent a check at runtime for each call that makes sure that the current object pointer is non-null. This can achieve a measurable performance gain for performance-sensitive code. In some cases, the failure to access the current object instance represents a correctness issue.

## How to Fix Violations
 Mark the member as static (or Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) or use 'this'/'Me' in the method body, if appropriate.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule for previously shipped code for which the fix would be a breaking change.
