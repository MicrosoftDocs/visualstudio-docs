# C28226
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Warning C28226: Annotation cannot also be a PrimOp (in current declaration)  
  
 This warning indicates that the named annotation is being declared as a PrimOp, and also was previously declared as a normal annotation. This should not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in normal use.
