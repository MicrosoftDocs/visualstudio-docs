# C28039
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28039: The type of actual parameter \<operand> should exactly match the type \<typename>  
  
 This warning is usually reported when an enum formal was not passed a member of the enum, but may also be used for other types.  
  
 Because C permits enums to be used interchangeably, and interchangeably with constants, it is easy to pass the wrong enum value to a function without an error.  
  
 For enum types, if the type of an enum parameter is annotated with `_Enum_is_bitflag_`, arithmetic is permitted on the parameter. Otherwise the parameter must be of exactly the correct type. If a constant is strictly required, warning C28137 may also apply.  
  
 This rule can be used for other parameter types as well; see the function documentation for why the types must match exactly.
