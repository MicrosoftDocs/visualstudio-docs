# C26117
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26117: Releasing unheld lock \<lock> in function \<func>.

Enforcement of syntactically scoped lock *acquire* and lock *release* pairs in C/C++ programs is not performed by the language. A function may introduce a locking side effect by making an observable modification to the concurrency state. For example, a lock wrapper function increments the number of lock acquisitions, or lock count, for a given lock.You can annotate a function that has a side effect from a lock acquire or lock release by using `_Acquires_lock_` or `_Releases_lock_`, respectively. Without such annotations, a function is expected not to change any lock count after it returns. If acquires and releases are not balanced, they are considered to be *orphaned*. Warning C26117 is issued when a function that has not been annotated with `_Releases_lock_` releases a lock that it doesn't hold, because the function must own the lock before it releases it.

## Example
The following example generates warning C26117 because the function `ReleaseUnheldLock` releases a lock that it doesn't necessarily hold—the state of `flag` is ambiguous—and there is no annotation that specifies that it should.

```cpp

typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA;

int flag;

void ReleaseUnheldLock(DATA* p)
{
    if (flag)
        EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
    // code ...
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
}
```

## Example
The following code fixes the problem by guaranteeing that the released lock is also acquired under the same conditions.

```cpp

typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA;

int flag;

void ReleaseUnheldLock(DATA* p)
{
    if (flag)
    {
        EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
        // code ...
        LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
    }
}
```
