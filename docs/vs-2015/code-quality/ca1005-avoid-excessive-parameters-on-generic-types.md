## Cause
 An externally visible generic type has more than two type parameters.

## Rule Description
 The more type parameters a generic type contains, the more difficult it is to know and remember what each type parameter represents. It is usually obvious with one type parameter, as in `List<T>`, and in certain cases with two type parameters, as in `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`. If more than two type parameters exist, the difficulty becomes too great for most users (for example, `TooManyTypeParameters<T, K, V>` in C# or `TooManyTypeParameters(Of T, K, V)` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]).

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use no more than two type parameters.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the design absolutely requires more than two type parameters. Providing generics in a syntax that is easy to understand and use reduces the time that is required to learn and increases the adoption rate of new libraries.
