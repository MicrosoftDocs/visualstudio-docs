## Cause
 A type or method is coupled with many other types.

## Rule Description
 This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains.

 Types and methods that have a high degree of class coupling can be difficult to maintain. It is a good practice to have types and methods that exhibit low coupling and high cohesion.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix this violation, try to redesign the type or method to reduce the number of types to which it is coupled.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Exclude this warning when the type or method is still considered maintainable despite its large number of dependencies on other types.
