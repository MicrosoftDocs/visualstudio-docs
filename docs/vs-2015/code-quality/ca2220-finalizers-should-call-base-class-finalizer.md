## Cause
 A type that overrides <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> does not call the <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method in its base class.

## Rule Description
 Finalization must be propagated through the inheritance hierarchy. To ensure this, types must call their base class <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method from within their own <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method. The C# compiler adds the call to the base class finalizer automatically.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, call the base type's <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method from your <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Some compilers that target the common language runtime insert a call to the base type's finalizer into the Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL). If a warning from this rule is reported, your compiler does not insert the call, and you must add it to your code.

## Example
 The following Visual Basic example shows a type `TypeB` that correctly calls the <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> method in its base class.
