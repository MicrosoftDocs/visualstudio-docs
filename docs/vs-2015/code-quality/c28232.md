# C28232
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28232: \_Pre\_, \_Post\_, or \_Deref\_ not applied to any annotation  
  
 This warning indicates that a `_Pre_`, `_Post_`, or `_Deref_` operator appears in an annotation expression without a subsequent functional annotation; the modifier was ignored, but this indicates an incorrectly coded annotation.
