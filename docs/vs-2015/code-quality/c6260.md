# C6260
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6260: sizeof * sizeof is almost always wrong, did you intend to use a character count or a byte count?  
  
 This warning indicates that the results of two `sizeof` operations have been multiplied together. The C/C++ `sizeof` operator returns the number of bytes of storage an object uses. It is typically incorrect to multiply it by another `sizeof` operation; usually one is interested in the number of bytes in an object or the number of elements in an array (for example the number of wide-characters in an array).  
  
 There is some unintuitive behavior associated with `sizeof` operator. For example, in C, the `sizeof ('\0') == 4,` because  a character  is of an integral type. In C++, the type of a character literal is `char`, so `sizeof ('\0') == 1`. However, in both C and C++, the following is true:  
  
```  
sizeof ("\0") == 2.   
```  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
void f( )  
{  
  int i;  
  i = sizeof (L"String") * sizeof (WCHAR);  
  // code ...  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
#include <windows.h>  
  
void f( )  
{  
  int i;  
  i= sizeof (L"String") / sizeof (WCHAR);  
  
  /* or to get bytes */  
  i = sizeof (L"String");  
  // code ...  
}  
```
