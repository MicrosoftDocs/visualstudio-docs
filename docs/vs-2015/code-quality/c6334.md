# C6334
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6334: sizeof operator applied to an expression with an operator may yield unexpected results  
  
 This warning indicates a misuse of the `sizeof` operator. The `sizeof` operator, when applied to an expression, yields the size of the type of the resulting expression.  
  
 For example, in the following code:  
  
```  
char     a[10];  
size_t   x;  
  
x = sizeof (a - 1);  
```  
  
 `x` will be assigned the value 4, not 9, because the resulting expression is no longer a pointer to the array `a`, but simply a pointer.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f( )  
{     
  size_t x;  
  char a[10];  
  
  x= sizeof (a - 4);  
  // code...  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
void f( )     
{  
  size_t x;  
  char a[10];  
  
  x= sizeof (a) - 4;  
  // code...  
}   
```
