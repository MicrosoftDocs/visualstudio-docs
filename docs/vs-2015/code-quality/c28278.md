# C28278
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Warning C28278: Function name appears with no prototype in scope.  
  
 This warning typically indicates that a `__deref` is needed to apply the `__return` annotation to the value returned.  
  
 The Code Analysis tool reports this warning when a function without a declaration was called, and the analysis that can be performed is limited because the declaration contains important information.  
  
 The C language permits (but discourages) the use of a function for which no prototype has been declared. A function definition or a function declaration (prototype) should appear before the first use of the function. This warning indicates that a function without a declaration was called, and the analysis that can be performed is limited because declaration contains important information. If the function declaration were to contain annotations, the function declaration is even more useful to the Code Analysis tool.
