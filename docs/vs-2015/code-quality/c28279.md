# C28279
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28279: For symbol, a 'begin' was found without a matching 'end'  
  
 The annotation language supports a begin and end (`{` and `}` in C) construct, and the pairing has gotten unbalanced. This situation can be avoided if the macros are used.
