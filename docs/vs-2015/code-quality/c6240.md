# C6240
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6240: (\<expression> && \<non-zero constant>) always evaluates to the result of \<expression>. Did you intend to use the bitwise-and operator?  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the right side of a logical-and operation that occurs in a test context. For example, the  expression `(n && 3)` reduces to `(!!n)`, which is the Boolean value of `n`.  
  
 This warning typically indicates an attempt to check a bit mask in which the bitwise-AND (`&`) operator should be used. It is not generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1 because of its use for selectively choosing code paths.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
  
void f(int n)  
{  
   if (n && INPUT_TYPE)   
   {  
      puts("boolean value of !!n is true");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("boolean value of !!n is false");  
   }  
}  
  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use bitwise-AND operator as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
#include <stdio.h>  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
  
void f(int n)  
{  
   if ( (n & INPUT_TYPE) )  
   {  
      puts("bitmask true");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("bitmak false");  
   }  
}  
```
