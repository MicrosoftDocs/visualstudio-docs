# C26116
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C26116: Failing to acquire or to hold lock \<lock> in \<func>.  
  
 Enforcement of syntactically scoped lock *acquire* and lock *release* pairs in C/C++ programs is not performed by the language. A function may introduce a locking side effect by making an observable modification to the concurrency state. For example, a lock wrapper function increments the number of lock acquisitions, or lock count, for a given lock.You can annotate a function that has a side effect from a lock acquire or lock release by using `_Acquires_lock_` or `_Requires_lock_held`, respectively. Without such annotations, a function is expected not to change any lock count after it returns. If acquires and releases are not balanced, they are considered to be *orphaned*. Warning C26116 is issued when a function has been annotated with `_Acquires_lock_`, but it does not acquire a lock, or when a function is annotated with `_Requires_lock_held` and releases the lock.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26116 because the function `DoesNotLock` was annotated with `_Acquires_lock_` but does not acquire it. The function `DoesNotHoldLock` generates the warning because it is annotated with `_Requires_lock_held` and does not hold it.  
  
```  
  
typedef struct _DATA   
{  
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;  
} DATA;  
  
_Acquires_lock_(p->cs) void DoesLock(DATA* p)   
{  
    EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs); // OK  
}  
  
_Acquires_lock_(p->cs) void DoesNotLock(DATA* p)   
{  
    // Warning C26116  
}  
  
_Requires_lock_held_(p->cs) void DoesNotHoldLock(DATA* p)   
{  
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs); // Warning C26116  
}  
  
```
