# C6235
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6235: (\<non-zero constant> &#124;&#124; \<expression>) is always a non-zero constant  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the left side of a logical-or operation that occurs in a test context. The right side of the logical-or operation is not evaluated because the resulting expression always evaluates to true. This is referred to as "short-circuit evaluation."  
  
 A non-zero constant value, other than one, suggests that the bitwise-AND operator (`&`) may have been intended. This warning is not generated for the common idiom when the non-zero constant is 1, because of its use for selectively enabling code paths, but it is generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1, for example 1+0.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because `INPUT_TYPE` is 2:  
  
```  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
void f(int n)  
{  
   if(INPUT_TYPE || n) //warning 6235 issued  
   {  
      puts("Always gets here");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("Never gets here");  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 The following code uses the bitwise-AND (`&`) operator to correct this warning:  
  
```  
#define INPUT_TYPE 2  
void f(int n)  
{  
   if((INPUT_TYPE & n) == 2)  
   {  
      puts("bitwise-AND comparison true");  
   }  
   else  
   {  
      puts("bitwise-AND comparison false");  
   }  
}  
```
