## Cause
 A public type is `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual basic) and declares a protected member or a protected nested type. This rule does not report violations for <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> methods, which must follow this pattern.

## Rule Description
 Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.

 The C# compiler issues a warning for this error.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, change the access level of the member to private, or make the type inheritable.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.

## Example
 The following example shows a type that violates this rule.
