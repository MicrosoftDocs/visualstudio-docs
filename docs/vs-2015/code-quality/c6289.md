# C6289
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C6289: Incorrect operator: mutual exclusion over &#124;&#124; is always a non-zero constant. Did you intend to use && instead?  
  
 This warning indicates that in a test expression a variable is being tested against two different constants and the result depends on either condition being true. This always evaluates to true.  
  
 This problem is generally caused by using `||` in place of `&&`, but can also be caused by using `!=` where `==` was intended.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
```  
void f(int x)  
{  
  if ((x != 1) || (x != 3))  
  {  
    // code   
  }  
}  
```  
  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
```  
void f(int x)  
{  
  if ((x != 1) && (x != 3))  
  {  
    // code   
  }  
}  
  
/* or */  
void f(int x)  
{  
  if ((x == 1) || (x == 3))  
  {  
    // code   
  }  
}  
```
