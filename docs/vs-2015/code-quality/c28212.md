# C28212
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

warning C28212: Pointer expression expected for annotation  
  
 This warning indicates that the numbered parameter to an annotation (not the function being annotated) is expected to be a pointer or array type, but some other type was encountered. The annotation needs to be corrected.
