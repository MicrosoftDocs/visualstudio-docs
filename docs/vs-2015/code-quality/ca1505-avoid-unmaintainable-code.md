## Cause
 A type or method has a low maintainability index value.

## Rule Description
 The maintainability index is calculated by using the following metrics: lines of code, program volume, and cyclomatic complexity. Program volume is a measure of the difficulty of understanding of a type or method that is based on the number of operators and operands in the code. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of the type or method. You can learn more about code metrics at [Measuring Complexity and Maintainability of Managed Code](../code-quality/measuring-complexity-and-maintainability-of-managed-code.md).

 A low maintainability index indicates that a type or method is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate to redesign.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix this violation, redesign the type or method and try to split it into smaller and more focused types or methods.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Exclude this warning when a type or method is still considered maintainable despite its large size or when the type or method cannot be split.
