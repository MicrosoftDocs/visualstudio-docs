## Cause
 A public or protected type contains only static members and is not declared with the [sealed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8e4ed5d3-10be-47db-9488-0da2008e6f3f) ([NotInheritable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5c4da7c9-9562-4653-a947-1972e992f9f9)) modifier.

## Rule Description
 This rule assumes that a type that contains only static members is not designed to be inherited, because the type does not provide any functionality that can be overridden in a derived type. A type that is not meant to be inherited should be marked with the `sealed` modifier to prohibit its use as a base type.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, mark the type as `sealed`. If you are targeting [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 2.0 or earlier, a better approach is to mark the type as `static`. In this manner, you avoid having to declare a private constructor to prevent the class from being created.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Suppress a warning from this rule only if the type is designed to be inherited. The absence of the `sealed` modifier suggests that the type is useful as a base type.

## Example of a Violation

### Description
 The following example shows a type that violates the rule.

## Fix with the Static Modifier

### Description
