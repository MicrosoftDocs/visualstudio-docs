# CA1031: Do not catch general exception types

## Cause
 A general exception such as <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.SystemException?displayProperty=fullName> is caught in a `catch` statement, or a general catch clause such as `catch()` is used.

## Rule Description
 General exceptions should not be caught.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, catch a more specific exception, or rethrow the general exception as the last statement in the `catch` block.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Catching general exception types can hide run-time problems from the library user and can make debugging more difficult.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], the common language runtime (CLR) no longer delivers corrupted state exceptions that occur in the operating system and managed code, such as access violations in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], to be handled by managed code. If you want to compile an application in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] or later versions and maintain handling of corrupted state exceptions, you can apply the <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute to the method that handles the corrupted state exception.

## Example
 The following example shows a type that violates this rule and a type that correctly implements the `catch` block.
