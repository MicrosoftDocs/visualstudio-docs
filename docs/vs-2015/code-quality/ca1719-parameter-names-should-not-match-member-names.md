## Cause
 The name of an externally visible member matches, in a case-insensitive comparison, the name of one of its parameters.

## Rule Description
 A parameter name should communicate the meaning of a parameter and a member name should communicate the meaning of a member. It would be a rare design where these were the same. Naming a parameter the same as its member name is unintuitive and makes the library difficult to use.

## How to Fix Violations
 Select a parameter name that does not match the member name.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 For new development, no known scenarios occur where you must suppress a warning from this rule. For shipping libraries, you might have to suppress a warning from this rule.
