## Cause
 A class declares and implements an instance field that is a <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> type and the class does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable>.

## Rule Description
 A class implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface to dispose of unmanaged resources that it owns. An instance field that is an <xref:System.IDisposable> type indicates that the field owns an unmanaged resource. A class that declares an <xref:System.IDisposable> field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource and should implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. If the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources, it should not implement a finalizer.

## How to Fix Violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, implement <xref:System.IDisposable> and from the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the field.

## When to Suppress Warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
 The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a class that satisfies the rule by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. The class does not implement a finalizer because the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources.
