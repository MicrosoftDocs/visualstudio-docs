# Container Tools build process for Visual Studio

This topic explains the Visual Studio build process for containerized apps that use Docker.  For performance reasons, Visual Studio follows a special process for containerized apps. You should understand this process if you plan to customize your build by modifying the Dockerfile.

When Visual Studio builds a project that doesn't use Docker containers, it invokes MSBuild on the local machine and generates the output files in a folder (typically `bin`) under your local solution folder. In the case of a containerized project, however, the build process takes account of the Dockerfile's instructions for building the containerized app. The Dockerfile that Visual Studio uses is divided into multiple stages. This relies on Docker's multistage build feature.

## Multistage build

The multistage build feature helps improve the process of building containers in order to make the build process more efficient and to make containers smaller by allowing them to contain only the bits that are actually needed at runtime, rather than including build artifacts.

The multistage build allows container images to be created in stages that produce intermediate images. As an example, consider a typical Dockerfile generated by Visual Studio - the first stage is `base`:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2-stretch-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443
```

The lines in the Dockerfile begin with the Nanoserver image from Microsoft Container Registry (mcr.microsoft.com) and create an intermediate image `base` that exposes ports 80 and 443, and sets the working directory to `/app`.

The next stage is `build`, which appears as follows:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2-stretch AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["WebApplication43/WebApplication43.csproj", "WebApplication43/"]
RUN dotnet restore "WebApplication43/WebApplication43.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/WebApplication43"
RUN dotnet build "WebApplication43.csproj" -c Release -o /app
```

You can see that the `build` stage starts from a different original image from the registry (`sdk` rather than `aspnet`), rather than continuing from base.  The `sdk` image has all the build tools, and for that reason it's a lot bigger than the aspnet image, which only contains runtime components. The reason for doing this becomes clear when you look at the rest of the Dockerfile:

```
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "WebApplication43.csproj" -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApplication43.dll"]
```

The final stage starts again from base, and includes the COPY --from=publish to copy the published output to the final image. This makes it possible for the final image to be a lot smaller, since it doesn't need to include all of the build tools that were in the `sdk` image.

## Faster builds for the Debug configuration

For performance reasons, the build process for containerized apps is not as straightforward as simply following the steps outlined in the Dockerfile. Building in a container is much slower than building outside of the container.  This is why when you build in the **Debug** configuration, Visual Studio actually builds your projects on the local machine, and then shares the output folder to the container using volume mounting. This is called FastMode build.

Visual Studio accomplishes this by invoking `docker build` with an argument that tells Docker to build only the `base` stage.  Visual Studio handles the rest of the process without regard to the contents of the Dockerfile. This is important because when you modify your Dockerfile, such as to customize the container environment or install additional dependencies, any modifications should be placed in the first stage.  Any custom steps placed in the Dockerfile's `build`, `publish`, or `final` stages will not be executed.

This performance optimization only occurs when you build in the Debug configuration. In the **Release** configuration, the build occurs in the container as specified in the Dockerfile.

If you want to disable the performance optimization and build as the Dockerfile specifies, then set the ContainerDevelopmentMode property to [TODO] in the project file as follows:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
   <ContainerDevelopmentMode>[TODO]</ContainerDevelopmentMode>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Docker build context

When using the command line to build containerized solutions, you use the command `docker build <context>` for each project in the solution. You need to provide the *build context* argument. The *build context* for a Dockerfile is the folder on the local machine that's used as the working folder to generate the image. For example, it's the folder that you copy files from when you copy to the container.  In .NET Core projects, this is the folder that contains the solution file (.sln).  Expressed as a relative path, this is typically ".." for the normal case of a Dockerfile in a project folder and the solution file in the parent folder.  For .NET Framework projects, the build context is the project folder, not the solution folder.

For .NET Framework projects, and for .NET Core projects created with versions of Visual Studio prior to Visual Studio 2017 Update 4, the Dockerfile did not use multistage builds. When working with these older Dockerfiles, instead of building the project in the Dockerfile, Visual Studio builds each project and then copies the results to the container. Because the build steps weren't included in the Dockerfile, you can't build those projects using `docker build` from the command line.  

## Building from the command line

To build a project or solution for a single Docker container from the command line, or from a script, run MSBuild with the `/t:ContainerBuild` command option.

```cmd
MSBuild <solution_name>.sln /t:ContainerBuild /p:Configuration=Debug
```

You'll see output similar to what you see in the **Output** window when you build your solution from the Visual Studio IDE.

When the **Debug** configuration is specified (and the **ContainerDevelopmentMode** property is set to **Fast**), Visual Studio uses the build optimization described in this article, so your project builds more quickly on the local machine and is copied to the container.  When the Release configuration is specified, the build occurs in the container and may be slower.

If you are using a Docker Compose project, use the command:

```
msbuild /t:DockerPackageService /p:DockerAppType=AspNet /p:Configuration=Release <project_name>\<project_name>.csproj
msbuild /p:Configuration=Release docker-compose.dcproj
```

## Scripting a containerized build using Azure DevOps

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your containerized apps and publish to Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub. Follow the instructions for setting up an Azure Pipeline in this article: [Build, test, and push Docker container app](/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/docker?view=azure-devops). However, to build your solution, use Visual Studio's MSBuild by adding an MSBuild task to your pipeline.  MSBuild builds the projects in your solution. Internally, it uses `docker build` to build your containers.

Add an MSBuild task to your pipeline as follows:

```
- task: MSBuild@1
  displayName: 'Build Application and main Docker Image'
  inputs:
    solution: '**/*.sln'
    msbuildArguments: '/t:ContainerBuild /p:Configuration=$(buildConfiguration)'
```

For more information, see [MSBuild task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/msbuild?view=azure-devops).
