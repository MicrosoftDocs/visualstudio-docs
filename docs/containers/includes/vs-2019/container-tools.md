With Visual Studio, you can easily build, debug, and run containerized .NET, ASP.NET, and ASP.NET Core apps and publish them to Azure Container Registry (ACR), Docker Hub, Azure App Service, or your own container registry. In this article, we'll publish an ASP.NET Core app to ACR.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) with the **Web Development**, **Azure Tools** workload, and/or **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload installed
* [.NET Core Development Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/) for development with .NET Core
* To publish to Azure Container Registry, an Azure subscription. [Sign up for a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/).

## Installation and setup

For Docker installation, first review the information at [Docker Desktop for Windows: What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install). Next, install [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

## Add a project to a Docker container

1. Create a new project using the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** template or if you want to use the .NET Framework instead of .NET Core, choose **ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)**.
1. Select **Web Application**, and make sure the **Enable Docker Support** checkbox is selected.

   ![Enable Docker Support check box](../../media/container-tools/vs-2019/create-new-web-application.PNG)

   The screenshot shows .NET Core; if you're using .NET Framework, it looks a bit different.

1. Select the type of container you want (Windows or Linux) and click **Create**.

## Dockerfile overview

A *Dockerfile*, the recipe for creating a final Docker image, is created in the project. Refer to [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for an understanding of the commands within it.:

```
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.2-aspnetcore-runtime-stretch-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk-stretch AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["HelloDockerTools/HelloDockerTools.csproj", "HelloDockerTools/"]
RUN dotnet restore "HelloDockerTools/HelloDockerTools.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/HelloDockerTools"
RUN dotnet build "HelloDockerTools.csproj" -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "HelloDockerTools.csproj" -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HelloDockerTools.dll"]
```

The preceding *Dockerfile* is based on the [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/) image, and includes instructions for modifying the base image by building your project and adding it to the container. If you're using the .NET Framework, the base image will be different.

When the new project dialog's **Configure for HTTPS** check box is checked, the *Dockerfile* exposes two ports. One port is used for HTTP traffic; the other port is used for HTTPS. If the check box isn't checked, a single port (80) is exposed for HTTP traffic.

## Debug

Select **Docker** from the debug drop-down in the toolbar, and start debugging the app. You might see a message with a prompt about trusting a certificate; choose to trust the certificate to continue.

The **Container Tools** option in the **Output** window shows what actions are taking place. The first time, it might take a while to download the base image, but it's much faster on subsequent runs.

### Changing launch settings

You can edit your `launchSettings.json` to customize how Visual Studio runs your container. For instance, you can set fixed ports for `http` and `https` by modifying your `launchSettings`'s `Docker` property with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "Docker": {
    "commandName": "Docker",
    "launchBrowser": true,
    "launchUrl": "{Scheme}://{ServiceHost}:{ServicePort}/",
    "publishAllPorts": true,
    "useSSL": true,
    "httpPort": 5000,
    "sslPort":  5001
  }
}
```

For further customization check out the [Container Tools launch settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/container-launch-settings?view=vs-2019) page.

## Containers window

If you have Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 or later, you can use the **Containers** window to view running containers on your machine, as well as images that you have available.

Open the **Containers** window by using the search box in the IDE (press **Ctrl**+**Q** to use it), type in `container`, and choose the **Containers** window from the list.

You can mount the **Containers** window in a convenient place, such as below the editor, by moving it around and following the window placement guides.

In the window, find your container and step through each tab to view the environment variables, port mappings, logs, and the filesystem.

For more information, see [View and diagnose containers and images in Visual Studio](../../view-and-diagnose-containers.md).

## Publish Docker images

Once the develop and debug cycle of the app is completed, you can create a production image of the app.

1. Change the configuration drop-down to **Release** and build the app.
1. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Publish**.
1. On the publish target dialog, select the **Container Registry** tab.
1. Choose **Create New Azure Container Registry** and click **Publish**.
1. Fill in your desired values in the **Create a new Azure Container Registry**.

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description                                |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **DNS Prefix** | Globally unique name | Name that uniquely identifies your container registry. |
    | **Subscription** | Choose your subscription | The Azure subscription to use. |
    | **[Resource Group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview)** | myResourceGroup |  Name of the resource group in which to create your container registry. Choose **New** to create a new resource group.|
    | **[SKU](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus)** | Standard | Service tier of the container registry  |
    | **Registry Location** | A location close to you | Choose a Location in a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near you or near other services that will use your container registry. |

1. Click **Create**

## Next Steps

You can now pull the container from the registry to any host capable of running Docker images, for example [Azure Container Instances](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-deploy-app).
