# Uninstall Visual Studio
This page walks you through uninstalling Visual Studio, our integrated suite of productivity tools for developers.  

1.  Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.  

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10 Anniversary Update, select **Start** and scroll to the letter **V**, where it is listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

     >[!NOTE]
     On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.<br/><br/> Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

2.  Click to start the installer, click the ![Details icon](media/vs2017uninstall-UninstallIcon.png "Select the Options icon") icon, and then click **Uninstall**.
