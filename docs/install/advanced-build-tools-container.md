# Advanced Example for Containers

The sample Dockerfile in [Install Build Tools into a Container](build-tools-container.md) always uses the latest microsoft/windowsservercore image and the latest Visual Studio Build Tools 2017 installer. If you publish this image to a [Docker registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry) for others to pull, this image may be okay for many scenarios. In practice, however, it's more common to be specific about what base image you use, what binaries you download, and which tool versions you install.

The following example Dockerfile uses a specific version tag of the microsoft/windowsservercore image. Using a specific tag for a base image is commonplace and makes it easy to remember that building or rebuilding images always has the same basis.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot install Visual Studio into microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.1593, which has known issues launching the installer in a container. For more information, see [known issues](build-tools-container-issues.md).

The example also uses a Build Tools 2017 bootstrapper that installs a specific version built at the same time as the bootstrapper. The product could still be updated via the Release channel, but that is not a practical scenario for containers that you would typically rebuild. If you want to get the URLs for a specific channel, you can download the channel from https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/channel, open the JSON file, and examine the bootstrapper URLs. For more information, see [Create a network installation of Visual Studio](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md).

```dockerfile
# Use a specific tagged image. Tags can be changed, though that is unlikely for most images.
# You could also use the immutable tag @sha256:d841bd78721c74f9b88e2700f5f3c2d66b54cb855b8acb4ab2c627a76a46301d

# Download tools to C:\Bin and install Build Tools excluding workloads and components with known issues.

    function Fetch ([string] $Uri, [string] $Path, [string] $Hash) { \
      Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -OutFile $Path; \
      if ($Hash -and ((Get-FileHash -Path $Path -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $Hash)) { \
        throw "\"Download hash for '$Path' incorrect\""; \
      } \
    }; \
    Fetch -Uri $env:NUGET_URI -Path C:\Bin\nuget.exe -Hash $env:NUGET_SHA256; \

    if (($ret = $p.ExitCode) -and ($ret -ne 3010)) { C:\TEMP\collect.exe; throw ('Install failed with exit code 0x{0:x}' -f $ret) }

# Restore default shell for Windows containers.
SHELL ["cmd.exe", "/s", "/c"]

# Start developer command prompt with any other commands specified.
ENTRYPOINT C:\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat &&

# Default to PowerShell if no other command specified.
CMD ["powershell.exe", "-NoLogo", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass"]
```

This example downloads specific tools and validates that the hashes match. It also downloads the latest Visual Studio and .NET log collection utility so that if an installation failure does occur, you can copy the logs to your host machine to analyze the failure.

```shell
> docker build -t buildtools:15.4.27004.2005 -t buildtools:latest -m 2GB .
Sending build context to Docker daemon

After the last line finishes executing, open "%TEMP%\vslogs.zip" on your machine or submit an issue on the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com) web site.

## Get support
Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see the [Troubleshooting Visual Studio 2017 installation and upgrade issues](troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) page. If none of the troubleshooting steps help, you can contact us by live chat for installation assistance (English only). For details, see the [Visual Studio support page](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/#talktous).

Here are a few more support options:
* You can report product issues to us via the [Report a Problem](../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md) tool that appears both in the Visual Studio Installer and in the Visual Studio IDE.
* You can share a product suggestion with us on [UserVoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579).
* You can track product issues in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/), and ask questions and find answers.
* You can also engage with us and other Visual Studio developers through our [Visual Studio conversation in the Gitter community](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/VisualStudio).  (This option requires a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.)
