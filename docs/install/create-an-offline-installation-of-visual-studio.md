# Create an offline installation of Visual Studio

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

We designed Visual Studio 2017 to work well in a variety of network and computer configurations. While we recommend that you try the [Visual Studio web installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads)&mdash;which is a small file and allows you to stay current with all the latest fixes and features&mdash;we understand that you might not be able to.

We designed Visual Studio 2019 to work well in a variety of network and computer configurations. While we recommend that you try the [Visual Studio web installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)&mdash;which is a small file and allows you to stay current with all the latest fixes and features&mdash;we understand that you might not be able to.

For example, you might have an unreliable internet connection or one that has low bandwidth. If so, you have a few options: You can use the new "Download all, then install" feature to download the files before you install, or you can use the command line to create a local cache of the files.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an enterprise administrator who wants to perform a deployment of Visual Studio to a network of client workstations that are firewalled from the internet, see our [Create a network installation of Visual Studio](../install/create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) and [Install certificates required for Visual Studio offline installation](../install/install-certificates-for-visual-studio-offline.md) pages.

## Use the "Download all, then install" feature

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

[**New in version 15.8**](/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes-v15.8#install): After you download the web installer, select the new **Download all, then install** option from the Visual Studio Installer. Then, continue with your installation.

After you download the web installer, select the new **Download all, then install** option from the Visual Studio Installer. Then, continue with your installation.

   ![The "Download all, then install" option](media/vs-2019/download-all-then-install-from-installer.png)

::: moniker-end

We designed the "Download all, then install" feature so that you can download Visual Studio as a single installation for the same computer on which you downloaded it. That way, you can safely disconnect from the web before you install Visual Studio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use the "Download all, then install" feature to create an offline cache that you intend to transfer to another computer. It's not designed to work that way. <br><br>If you want to create an offline cache to install Visual Studio on another computer, see the [Use the command line to create a local cache](#use-the-command-line-to-create-a-local-cache) section of this page for information about how to create a local cache, or the [Create a network installation of Visual Studio](../install/create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) page for information about how to create a network cache.

## Use the command line to create a local cache

After you download a small bootstrapper, use the command line to create a local cache. Then, use the local cache to install Visual Studio. (This process replaces the ISO files that were available for previous versions.)

Here's how.

### Step 1 - Download the Visual Studio bootstrapper

You must have an internet connection to complete this step.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

To get a bootstrapper for Visual Studio 2017, see the [Visual Studio previous versions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) download page for details on how to do so.

Your setup executable&mdash;or to be more specific, the bootstrapper file&mdash;should match or be similar to one of the following.

| Edition | Filename |
|-------------|-----------------------|
|Visual Studio Community | vs_community.exe |
|Visual Studio Professional | vs_professional.exe |
|Visual Studio Enterprise | vs_enterprise.exe |
|Visual Studio Build Tools   | vs_buildtools.exe |

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

Start by downloading the Visual Studio bootstrapper for your chosen edition of Visual Studio. Your setup file&mdash;or bootstrapper&mdash;will match or be similar to one of the following.

| Edition                    | File                                                                    |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visual Studio Community    | [vs_community.exe](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=community&rel=16&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=offline+install&utm_content=download+vs2019)       |
| Visual Studio Professional | [vs_professional.exe](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=professional&rel=16&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=offline+install&utm_content=download+vs2019) |
| Visual Studio Enterprise   | [vs_enterprise.exe](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=enterprise&rel=16&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=offline+install&utm_content=download+vs2019)     |
| Visual Studio Build Tools   | [vs_buildtools.exe](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=buildtools&rel=16&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=offline+install&utm_content=download+vs2019)     |

>[!TIP]
>If you previously downloaded a bootstrapper file and want to verify its version, here's how. In Windows, open File Explorer, right-click the bootstrapper file, choose **Properties**, choose the **Details** tab, and then view the **Product version** number. To match that number to a release of Visual Studio, see the [Visual Studio build numbers and release dates](visual-studio-build-numbers-and-release-dates.md) page.

### Step 2 - Create a local install cache

You must have an internet connection to complete this step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you install Visual Studio Community, you must activate it within 30 days of installation. This requires an internet connection.

Open a command prompt and use one of the commands from the following examples. The examples that are listed here assume that you're using the Community edition of Visual Studio; adjust the command as appropriate for your edition.

> [!TIP]
> To prevent an error, make sure that your full installation path is less than 80 characters.

- For .NET web and .NET desktop development, run:

   ```cmd
    vs_community.exe --layout c:\vslayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb --add Component.GitHub.VisualStudio --includeOptional --lang en-US
    ```

- For .NET desktop and Office development, run:

   ```cmd
    vs_community.exe --layout c:\vslayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Office --includeOptional --lang en-US
    ```

- For C++ desktop development, run:

   ```cmd
    vs_community.exe --layout c:\vslayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended --lang en-US
    ```

- To create a complete local layout with all features (this will take a long time&mdash;we have _lots_ of features!), run:

   ```cmd
    vs_community.exe --layout c:\vslayout --lang en-US
    ```

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

   > [!NOTE]
   > A complete Visual Studio layout requires a minimum of 35 GB of disk space. For more information, see [System requirements](/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2017-system-requirements-vs/). And for information about how to create a layout with only the components you want to install, see [Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > A complete Visual Studio layout requires a minimum of 35 GB of disk space. For more information, see [System requirements](/visualstudio/releases/2019/system-requirements/). And for information about how to create a layout with only the components you want to install, see [Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md).

::: moniker-end

If you want to install a language other than English, change `en-US` to a locale from the [List of language locales](#list-of-language-locales). Then, use the [list of the components and workloads available](workload-and-component-ids.md) to further customize your installation cache.

### Step 3 - Install Visual Studio from the local cache

> [!TIP]
> When you run from a local install cache, setup uses the local versions of each of these files. But if you select components during installation that aren't in the cache, setup attempts to download them from the internet.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For offline installations, if you get an error message that says "A product matching the following parameters cannot be found", make sure that you are using the `--noweb` switch with version 16.3.5 or later.
>
::: moniker-end

To make sure that you install only the files that you've previously downloaded, use the same command-line options that you used to create the layout cache. For example, if you created a layout cache with the following command:

```cmd
vs_community.exe --layout c:\vslayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb --add Component.GitHub.VisualStudio --includeOptional --lang en-US
```

Then use this command to run the installation:

```cmd
c:\vslayout\vs_community.exe --noweb --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb --add Component.GitHub.VisualStudio --includeOptional
```

For more examples of how to use [command-line parameters](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md), see the [Command-line parameter examples for Visual Studio installation](command-line-parameter-examples.md) page. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you get an error that a signature is invalid, you must install updated certificates. Open the Certificates folder in your offline cache. Double-click each of the certificate files, and then click through the Certificate Manager wizard. If you're asked for a password, leave it blank.
