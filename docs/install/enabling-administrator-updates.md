# Enabling administrator updates to Visual Studio with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager

The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (SCCM) can manage Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 administrator updates by using the Software Update management workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> For documentation simplicity, the content below will refer to the Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 products collectively as "Visual Studio".

When Microsoft publishes a new Visual Studio update to the Content Delivery Network (CDN), Microsoft will simultaneously publish a corresponding administrator update package to the Microsoft Update servers. This will then enable an administrator to distribute the Visual Studio update via the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) (MUC) or [Windows Server Update Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/get-started/windows-server-update-services-wsus) (WSUS). Configuration Manager can be set up to synchronize the Visual Studio administrator updates from the WSUS catalog into the site server, and then, it can download the update and distribute it to Visual Studio client machines across the organization. For more information about which fixes are present in each release of Visual Studio, see the [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes). 

To distribute Visual Studio administrator updates through Configuration Manager, you’ll need to take these two initial preparation steps: 
1. Enable Configuration Manager to receive Visual Studio administrator update notifications. 
2. Enable (or disable) client machines to receive Visual Studio administrator updates from Configuration Manager.

After you perform these steps, you can use the software update management capabilities of Configuration Manager to deploy the Visual Studio administrator updates. The different types and characteristics of Visual Studio administrator updates are described in [Applying administrator updates](../install/applying-administrator-updates.md), which provides guidance about how and when they should be distributed throughout your organization. For more information about Configuration Manager functionality and options, see [Deploy software updates in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/sum/deploy-use/deploy-software-updates). 

## Enable Configuration Manager to receive Visual Studio administrator update notifications 

To enable Configuration Manager to manage Visual Studio administrator updates, you will need: 

* A current licensed version of Windows Server running Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (current branch) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). You can’t use WSUS itself to deploy these updates; it must be used in conjunction with Configuration Manager. 

* The hierarchy’s top-level WSUS server and the top-level Configuration Manager site server must have access to the Visual Studio URLs and ports listed here: [Install and use Visual Studio and Azure Services behind a firewall or proxy server](../install/install-and-use-visual-studio-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server.md).  

* The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager must be configured to receive notifications when Visual Studio administrator update packages are available.  To do that, use the following steps, and for more information, see [Introduction to software updates in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/sum/understand/software-updates-introduction).

  1. In the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** (bottom-left), then select **Site Configuration** (middle left), then **Sites**, and select your site server. 

  2. On the **Home** tab ribbon at the top, in the **Settings** group button, select **Configure Site Components**, and then select **Software Update Point**. 

  3. In the **Software Update Point Component Properties** dialog box: 

        * On the **Products** tab, under the **Developer Tools, Runtimes, and Redistributables** hierarchy, choose the versions of Visual Studio you want to synchronize.   

        * On the **Classifications** tab, make sure “Security Updates”, “Feature Packs”, and “Updates” are selected.   

  4. Next, synchronize the software updates with the WSUS server by choosing **Software Library** (bottom-left), and then on the **Home** tab ribbon at the top, select the **Synchronize Software Updates** button. Synchronizing Software Updates will make the available Visual Studio administrator updates visible in, and able to be deployed from, the Configuration Manager console.   

## Enable (or disable) client machines' ability to receive Visual Studio administrator updates from Configuration Manager

To enable a client machine to accept Visual Studio administrator updates, you will need to ensure that the Visual Studio Client Detector Utility is installed properly, and you will need to set a registry key to enable the client to receive administrator updates.  

### Visual Studio Client Detector Utility 

The Visual Studio Client Detector Utility must be installed on the client machines in order for the administrator updates to be received properly. This utility was included with all recent Visual Studio releases.  

### Encoding administrator intent on the client machines 

The client computers must be enabled to receive administrator updates. This step is necessary to make sure that the updates are not unintentionally or accidentally pushed out to unsuspecting client computers. 

The **AdministratorUpdatesEnabled** key is designed for the administrator to encode administrator intent. This key can be in any of the standard Visual Studio locations as described in the [Set defaults for enterprise deployments of Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/set-defaults-for-enterprise-deployments) documentation. Admin access on the client computer is required to create and set the value of this key. 

* To configure the client computer to accept Administrator Updates, set the **AdministratorUpdatesEnabled** REG_DWORD key to **1**. 
* If the **AdministratorUpdatesEnabled** REG_DWORD key is **missing or is set to 0**, administrator updates will be blocked from applying to the client computer. 

## Feedback and support
[!INCLUDE[install_get_support_md](includes/install_get_support_md.md)]

You can use the following methods to provide feedback about Visual Studio administrator updates or report issues that affect the updates:
* Refer to the [Troubleshooting Visual Studio installation and upgrade issues](../install/troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) guidance.
* Ask questions to the community at the [Visual Setup Q&A Forum](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/vs-setup.html).
* Go to the [Visual Studio support page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/), and check whether your issue is listed in the FAQ.  You can also select the [Support Link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) button for chat help.
* [Provide feature feedback or report a problem](https://aka.ms/vs/wsus/feedback) to the Visual Studio team for this experience.
* Contact your organization’s technical account manager for Microsoft.
