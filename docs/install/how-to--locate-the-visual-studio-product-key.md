# How to: Locate the Visual Studio Product Key
You may want to locate the product key for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../codequality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] when you are working with customer support, upgrading from a trial version, or updating your own records.  
  
### To find the product key for Visual Studio  
  
-   Look for the product key in one of these locations:  
  
    -   On the installation media (if applicable).  
  
    -   On the [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) website.  
  
    -   Documentation or other communication from the vendor from whom you purchased the software.
