# Update a network-based installation of Visual Studio

It's possible to update a network installation layout of Visual Studio with the latest product updates so that it can be used both as an installation point for the latest update of Visual Studio and also to maintain installations that are already deployed to client workstations.

## How to update a network layout

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions assume that you've previously created a network installation layout. For more information about how to do so, see the [Create a network installation of Visual Studio](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) page.

To refresh your network install share so that it includes the latest updates, run the `--layout` command to incrementally download updated packages.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

**New in 15.3**: If you selected a partial layout when you [first created the network layout](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md), those settings are saved. Any future layout commands use the previous options plus any new options that you specify. But if you are using a layout of an earlier version, you should use the same command-line parameters that you used when you first created the network install layout (in other words, the same workloads and languages) to update its content.

If you selected a partial layout when you [first created the network layout](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md), those settings are saved. Any future layout commands use the previous options plus any new options that you specify.

If you host a layout on a file share, you should update a private copy of the layout (for example, c:\VSLayout) and then, after all of the updated content is downloaded, copy it to your file share (for example, \\server\products\VS). If you don't do this, there is a greater chance that any users who run Setup while you are updating the layout might not be able to get all of the content from the layout because it is not yet completely updated.

Let's walk through a few examples of how to create and then update a layout:

* First, here's an example of how to create a layout with one workload for English only:

  ```cmd
  vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --lang en-US
  ```

* Here's how to update that same layout to a newer version. You don't have to specify any additional command-line parameters. The previous settings were saved and will be used by any subsequent layout commands in this layout folder.

  ```cmd
  vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout
  ```

* Here's how to update your layout to a newer version in an unattended manner. The layout operation runs the setup process in a new console window. The window is left open so users can see the final result and a summary of any errors that might have occurred. If you are performing a layout operation in an unattended manner (for example, you have a script that is regularly run to update your layout to the latest version), then use the `--passive` parameter and the process will automatically close the window.

  ```cmd
  vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout --passive
  ```

* Here's how to add an additional workload and localized language.  (This command adds the *Azure development* workload.)  Now both Managed Desktop and Azure are included in this layout.  The language resources for English and German are also included for all these workloads.  And, the layout is updated to the latest available version.

  ```cmd
  vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Azure --lang de-DE
  ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > An update operation doesn't install newly added optional components. If you need the newly added optional components, please remove the old optional components in the `Layout.JSON` [response file](automated-installation-with-response-file.md) and include the components you need in the "add" section of `Layout.JSON`. 
    >
    > **Workaround**: Run a separate modify operation after an upgrade to install the missing components.

* And finally, here's how to add an additional workload and localized language without updating the version. (This command adds the *ASP.NET and web development* workload.)  Now the Managed Desktop, Azure, and ASP.NET & Web Development workloads are included in this layout. The language resources for English, German, and French are also included for all these workloads.  However, the layout was not updated to the latest available version when this command was run. It remains at the existing version.

  ```cmd
  vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb --lang fr-FR --keepLayoutVersion
  ```

## Deploy an update to client machines

Depending on how your network environment is configured, an update can either be deployed by an enterprise administrator or initiated from a client machine.

* Users can update a Visual Studio instance that was installed from an offline installation folder:
  * Run the Visual Studio Installer.
  * Then, click **Update**.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

* Administrators can update client deployments of Visual Studio without any user interaction with two separate commands:
  * First, update the Visual Studio installer: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe --quiet --update```
  * Then, update the Visual Studio application itself: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe update --installPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise" --quiet --wait --norestart```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

* Administrators can update client deployments of Visual Studio without any user interaction with two separate commands:
  * First, update the Visual Studio installer: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe --quiet --update```
  * Then, update the Visual Studio application itself: <br>```vs_enterprise.exe update --installPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise" --quiet --wait --norestart```

> [!NOTE]
> Use the [vswhere.exe command](tools-for-managing-visual-studio-instances.md) to identify the install path of an existing instance of Visual Studio on a client machine.

## Verify a layout

Use `--verify` to perform verification on the offline cache supplied. It checks if packages files are either missing or invalid. At the end of the verification, it prints the list of missing files and invalid files.

```cmd
vs_enterprise.exe --layout <layoutDir> --verify
```

The vs_enterprise.exe can be invoked inside the layoutDir.

> [!NOTE]
> Some important metadata files that are needed by the `--verify` option must be in the layout offline cache. If these metadata files are missing, "--verify" cannot run and Setup gives you an error. If you experience this error, re-create a new offline layout to a different folder (or to the same offline cache folder. To so do, run the same layout command that you used to create the initial offline layout. For example, `vs_enterprise.exe --layout <layoutDir>`.

Microsoft ships updates to Visual Studio periodically, so the new layout that you create might not be the same version as the initial layout.

> [!NOTE]
> Verification works only for the latest version of a specific minor version of Visual Studio. As soon as a new version is released, verification won't work for earlier patch level releases of the same minor version.

## Fix a layout

Use `--fix` to perform the same verification as `--verify` and also try to fix the identified issues. The `--fix` process needs an internet connection, so make sure your machine is connected to the internet before you invoke `--fix`.

```cmd
vs_enterprise.exe --layout <layoutDir> --fix
```

The vs_enterprise.exe can be invoked inside the layoutDir.

## Remove older versions from a layout

After you perform layout updates to an offline cache, the layout cache folder may have some obsolete packages that are no longer needed by the latest Visual Studio installation. You can use the `--clean` option to remove obsolete packages from an offline cache folder.

To do this, you'll need the file path(s) to catalog manifest(s) that contain those obsolete packages. You can find the catalog manifests in an "Archive" folder in the offline layout cache. They are saved there when you update a layout. In the "Archive" folder, there is one or more "GUID" named folders, each of which contains an obsolete catalog manifest. The number of "GUID" folders should be the same as the number of updates made to your offline cache.

A few files are saved inside each "GUID" folder. The two files of most interest are a "catalog.json" file and a "version.txt" file. The "catalog.json" file is the obsolete catalog manifest you'll need to pass to the `--clean` option. The other version.txt file contains the version of this obsolete catalog manifest. Based on the version number, you can decide whether you want to remove obsolete packages from this catalog manifest. You can do the same as you go through the other "GUID" folders. After you make the decision on the catalog(s) you want to clean, run the `--clean` command by supplying the files paths to these catalogs.

Here are a few examples of how to use the --clean option:

```cmd
vs_enterprise.exe --layout <layoutDir> --clean <file-path-of-catalog1> <file-path-of-catalog2> …
```

```cmd
vs_enterprise.exe --layout <layoutDir> --clean <file-path-of-catalog1> --clean <file-path-of-catalog2> …
```

You can also invoke vs_enterprise.exe inside the &lt;layoutDir&gt;. Here's an example:

```cmd
c:\VSLayout\vs_enterprise.exe --layout c:\VSLayout --clean c:\VSLayout\Archive\1cd70189-fc55-4583-8ad8-a2711e928325\Catalog.json --clean c:\VS2017Layout\Archive\d420889f-6aad-4ba4-99e4-ed7833795a10\Catalog.json
```

When you execute this command, Setup analyzes your offline cache folder to find the list of files that it will remove. You will then have a chance to review the files that are going to be deleted and confirm the deletions.

## Get support for your offline installer

If you experience a problem with your offline installation, we want to know about it. The best way to tell us is by using the [Report a Problem](../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md) tool. When you use this tool, you can send us the telemetry and logs we need to help us diagnose and fix the problem.

We also offer a [**live chat**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only) support option for installation-related issues.

We have other support options available, too. For a list, see our [Feedback](../ide/feedback-options.md) page.
