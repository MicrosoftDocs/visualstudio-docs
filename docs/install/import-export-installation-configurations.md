# Import or export installation configurations

You can configure Visual Studio across your organization with installation configuration files. To do so, simply export the workload and component information to a .vsconfig file by using the Visual Studio installer. You can then import the configuration into new or existing installations, and share them with others, too.

Here's how.

## Export a configuration

You can choose to export an installation configuration file from either a previously installed instance of Visual Studio or one that you're currently installing.

1. Open the Visual Studio Installer.

1. On the product card, choose the **More** button, and then select **Export configuration**.

## Automatically install missing components

**New in Visual Studio 2019**: When you save a .vsconfig file to your solution root directory and then open a solution, Visual Studio automatically detects which components are missing and prompts you to install them.

You can also generate a .vsconfig file right from Solution Explorer.

1. Right-click on your solution file.

1. Choose **Add** > **Installation Configuration File**.

1. Confirm the location where you want to save the .vsconfig file, and then choose **Review details**.

1. Make sure you've got the workloads and components that you want, and then choose **Export**.
