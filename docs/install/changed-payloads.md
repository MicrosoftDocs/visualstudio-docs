# Package payload changes

Some package payloads are allowed to change after a release has already shipped. When you or someone else creates a layout, this behavior might result in different layout content, depending on when a layout was created.

## Verify that a layout includes package payload changes

Here's how to determine if the layout that was previously created has acquired the package payloads that were modified after the release shipped:

1. Open the setup log. The log is typically at `%TEMP%\dd_setup_[date].log` where `[date]` is when the layout operation started in `yyyyMMddHHmmss` format.

2. Look for a line in the log that is structured like the following text:

    `Falling back to signature and signer check because hash verification returned HashMismatch for path: [path]`

3. Then, look for lines later in the log that indicate that the download succeeded for the [path]. They might look similar to the following text:

    `Download of [url] succeeded using engine 'WebClient'`

    `END: Downloading [url] to [path]`
