# Set defaults for enterprise deployments of Visual Studio

You can set registry policies that affect the deployment of Visual Studio. These policies are global for the new installer and affect:

- Where some packages shared with other versions or instances are installed
- Where packages are cached
- Whether all packages are cached

You can set some of these policies using [command line options](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md), set registry values on your machine, or even distribute them using Group Policy across an organization.

## Registry keys

There are a number of registry keys you can set. As soon as a policy value is discovered in the order below, the remaining keys are ignored.

1. `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup`
2. `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup`
3. `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup` (on 64-bit operating systems)

Some registry values will be set automatically the first time they are used if not set already. This ensures that subsequent installs use the same values. These will be stored in the second registry key, `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Setup`.

You can set the following registry values in any of those keys above.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| `CachePath` | `REG_SZ` or `REG_EXPAND_SZ` | %ProgramData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Packages | The directory where package manifests and, optionally, payloads are stored. Read how to [disable or move the package cache](disable-or-move-the-package-cache.md) for more information. |
| `KeepDownloadedPayloads` | `REG_DWORD` | 1 | Keep package payloads even after they are installed. You can change the value anytime. Disabling the policy will remove any cached package payloads for the instance you repair or modify. Read how to [disable or move the package cache](disable-or-move-the-package-cache.md) for more information. |
| `SharedInstallationPath` | `REG_SZ` or `REG_EXPAND_SZ` | %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared | The directory where some packages shared across versions of instances of Visual Studio are installed. You can change the value anytime, but that will only affect future installs. Any products already installed to the old location should not be moved or they may not function correctly. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change the `CachePath` registry policy after any installs you must move the existing package cache to the new location and make sure it's secured so that `SYSTEM` and `Administrators` have Full Control and `Everyone` has Read access.
> Failure to move the existing cache or securing it may cause problems with future installs.
