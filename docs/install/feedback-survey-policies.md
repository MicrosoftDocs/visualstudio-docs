# Configure feedback Group Policies

Visual Studio allows you to configure and deploy global machine-wide policies across your organization by using the [Microsoft Intune settings catalog](/intune/intune-service/configuration/settings-catalog) or by importing [Visual Studio Administrative Templates (ADMX)](administrative-templates.md) into legacy tools like Group Policy editor. To learn more, see [Configure policies for enterprise deployments of Visual Studio](configure-policies-for-enterprise-deployments.md).

One of the main categories included in the Visual Studio ADMX templates is feedback. Feedback Group Policies can be used to control the types of feedback sent through Visual Studio. IT administrators may find these policies useful to control whether Visual Studio users in their organization are permitted to submit feedback or survey responses to Microsoft. By default, users can submit both feedback and survey responses through Visual Studio.

## Supported policies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These policies require Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13 or later

In addition to configuring policies through Intune or the Group Policy editor, you can find and adjust policies in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Feedback`.

Feedback Group Policies for Visual Studio include the following:

| **Name**                         | **Description**                                               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SurveysDisabled`                | **Controls whether the user receives survey links in Visual Studio:** If enabled, Visual Studio and the Visual Studio Installer don't display any product survey requests or links to surveys to the user. |
| `ProductFeedbackDisabled`        | **Controls whether the user can submit feedback through Visual Studio:** If enabled, Visual Studio and the Visual Studio Installer don't allow users to submit feedback to Microsoft. Examples include, but aren't limited to reporting feedback, submitting suggestions, and providing feedback on features via a thumbs up/down control. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > `DisableFeedbackDialog` is an older feedback policy that may be available on your machine depending on the ADMX template version on box. This policy controls feedback mechanisms in Visual Studio 2019 and earlier. We recommend using the newer `SurveysDisabled` and `ProductFeedbackDisabled` policies only.
