# Configure installation default settings using a response file

In this article, you learn how to create a response file that helps you automate your Visual Studio installation. It's most common use is when you install Visual Studio from a [layout](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md). 

The Visual Studio response file is a [JSON](http://json-schema.org/) file whose contents contain customizations used during the initial installation of Visual Studio onto the client. Its contents mirror the [command line arguments and parameters](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md). Use the response file for the following configuration options:

- [**Configure which workloads, components, or languages should be selected by default**](install-visual-studio.md#step-4---choose-workloads) during initial install.
- Reference an [**installation configuration `*.vsconfig` file**](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#configure-the-contents-of-a-layout) that your team has standardized on.
- Specify [**where the client should receive updates from**](update-visual-studio.md#configure-source-location-of-updates-1). Examples include the default Microsoft hosted servers on the internet or from an admin-controlled network layout location.
- Automatic removal of [**out-of-support components**](update-visual-studio.md#remove-out-of-support-components) during updates.

## Creating the response file

The `response.json` file is typically created when an administrator [creates a layout](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) and can be found in the root folder of the layout. However, you can create your own response file using one of the following examples.

## Specifying the response file

If an administrator [deploys Visual Studio by invoking the bootstrapper from a layout](deploy-a-layout-onto-a-client-machine.md#install-visual-studio-onto-a-client-machine-from-a-layout), the response file found in the layout's root directory is automatically used. Administrators can also choose to explicitly specify a different response file by using the `--in` parameter, as in the following example:

```shell
\\server\share\layoutdirectory\vs_enterprise.exe --in custom_response_file.json
```

## Response file contents

The response file encapsulates command line parameters used by the Visual Studio Installer, and it follows these general rules:
 - If a command-line parameter takes no arguments (for example, `--quiet`, `--passive`, `includeRecommended`, `removeOos`, `useLatestInstaller`, `allowUnsignedExtensions`, etc.), the value in the response file should be true/false. 
 - If the parameter takes an argument (for example, `--installPath <dir>`, `--config <*.vsconfig file>`), then the value in the response file should be a string. 
 - If the parameter takes an argument and can appear on the command-line more than once (for example, `--add <id>`), the value in the response file should be an array of strings.

Parameters that are specified on the command-line override the settings that are included in the response file, except when parameters take multiple inputs (for example, `--add`). When you have multiple inputs, the inputs supplied on the command line are merged with settings from the response file.

## Configure the response file used when installing from a layout

If you create a layout by using the `--layout` command, then a default `response.json` file is created in the root of the layout folder. Administrators are expected to modify and customize the response file appropriately *before* installing onto a client machine. That way, they can control the client's initial configuration settings.

The configuration settings in the `response.json` file are only referenced when executing a [bootstrapper](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#download-the-visual-studio-bootstrapper-to-create-the-layout) (for example, vs_enterprise.exe). Bootstrappers are typically used to perform initial installation on the client, but sometimes they're used to update a client too. The `response.json` is never used when you launch the installer locally on the client.  

If the administrator created a partial layout, then the default `response.json` file in the layout specifies only the workloads and languages that were included in the partial layout. 

If the layout is created by passing in a `--config *.vsconfig` file, then the `*.vsconfig` file is copied into the layout directory as `layout.vsconfig` and this config file is referenced in the `response.json` file. This way, you can use configuration files to initialize client installations that come from a layout. 

Make sure to pay special attention to the channelUri setting, which configures [where the client looks for updates](update-visual-studio.md#configure-source-location-of-updates-1). The default configuration is for the client to look at Microsoft hosted servers on the internet for updates. You need to change the value of channelUri and point it to your layout if you want clients to get their updates from your layout. Examples for how to do this are [detailed below](#example-customized-layout-response-file-content). You can always change where a client looks for updates in the future by [executing the installer on the client and invoking the `modifySettings` command](use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md#modifysettings-command-and-command-line-parameters). 

If the client installation is **not** done using `--quiet` or `--passive` mode, users can override the defaults specified in the `response.json` and further select or unselect additional workloads and components to install. 

> [!WARNING]
> Be very careful when editing properties in the `response.json` defined when the layout was created, as some of the items are required for installation. 

The base `response.json` file in a layout should look similar to the following example, except that the productID would reflect the edition in your layout.   

::: moniker range="=vs-2019"

```Default response.json
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/channel",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.16.Release",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise"
}
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="=vs-2022"

```Default response.json for Current channel layout
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/channel",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.17.Release",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise"
}
```

```Default response.json for LTSC 17.0 channel layout
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "https://aka.ms/vs/17/release.ltsc.17.0/channel",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.17.Release.LTSC.17.0",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise"
}
```

::: moniker-end

When you create or update a layout, a response.template.json file is also created.  This file contains all of the workload, component, and language IDs that can be used.  This file is provided as a template for what all could be included in a custom install. Administrators can use this file as a starting point for a custom response file. Just remove the IDs for the things you do not want to install and save it in the `response.json` file or your own response file. Do not customize the response.template.json file or your changes are lost whenever the layout is updated.

## Example customized layout response file content

::: moniker range="=vs-2019"

The following `response.json` file example initializes a Visual Studio Enterprise client install to select several common workloads and components, to select both the English and French UI languages, and to have the update location configured to look for sources in a network hosted layout. For Visual Studio 2019, the update location (channelUri) can only be configured during initial installation and cannot be changed after the fact *unless* you use the functionality in the latest installer. Refer to the [Configure policies for enterprise deployments of Visual Studio](configure-policies-for-enterprise-deployments.md#configuring-source-location-for-updates) and the [Configure your layout to always include and provide the latest installer](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#configure-the-layout-to-always-include-and-provide-the-latest-installer) for information on how to configure this.

```Example response.json
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "\\\\server\\share\\layoutdirectory\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.16.Release",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise",

  "installPath": "C:\\VS2019",
  "quiet": false,
  "passive": false,
  "includeRecommended": true,
  "norestart": false,
  "useLatestInstaller": true,
  "removeOos": true,
  
  "addProductLang": [
    "en-US",
    "fr-FR"
    ],

    "components": [
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Data",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Office",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Universal",
        "Component.GitHub.VisualStudio"
    ]
}
```

The following `response.json` file example initializes a Visual Studio Enterprise client install to select several common workloads and components, to select both the English and French UI languages, and to have the update location configured to look for sources in a network hosted layout. Refer to the [Configure policies for enterprise deployments of Visual Studio](configure-policies-for-enterprise-deployments.md#configuring-source-location-for-updates) and the [Configure your layout to always include and provide the latest installer](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#configure-the-layout-to-always-include-and-provide-the-latest-installer) for information on how to configure this.

```Example response.json
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "\\\\server\\share\\layoutdirectory\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.17.Release",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise",

  "installPath": "C:\\VS2022",
  "quiet": false,
  "passive": false,
  "includeRecommended": true,
  "norestart": false,
  "useLatestInstaller": true,
  "removeOos": true,
  
  "addProductLang": [
    "en-US",
    "fr-FR"
    ],

    "components": [
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Data",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetWeb",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Office",
        "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Universal"
    ]
}
```

In the following example, the `response.json` file initializes a Visual Studio Enterprise client install that:
- [Uses a configuration *.vsconfig file that defines what workloads, components, and extensions to install](import-export-installation-configurations.md#use-a-configuration-file-to-initialize-the-contents-of-a-layout)
- Selects both the English and French UI languages
- Configures the [update location to look for sources in an http hosted layout](create-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md#making-your-layout-accessible-via-an-intranet-site)
- Allows [programmatic loading of unsigned extensions](import-export-installation-configurations.md#extensions)
- [Removes components transitioned to an out-of-support state at the time of updating the client](update-visual-studio.md#remove-out-of-support-components). See the list of out-of-support components [here](out-of-support-components.md).

```Example response.json
{
  "installChannelUri": ".\\ChannelManifest.json",
  "channelUri": "http://MyCompanyIntranetSite/VS2022Enterprise/ChannelManifest.json",
  "installCatalogUri": ".\\Catalog.json",
  "channelId": "VisualStudio.17.Release",
  "productId": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Enterprise",
  "arch": "x64",
  "config": ".\\Layout.vsconfig"
  "installPath": "C:\\VS2022",
  "quiet": false,
  "passive": false,
  "includeRecommended": true,
  "norestart": false,
  "useLatestInstaller": true,
  "removeOos": true,
  "allowUnsignedExtensions": true,

  "addProductLang": [
    "en-US",
    "fr-FR"
    ]

}
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using intranet webhosted layouts, you can’t set “noWeb”: true in the response.json and expect it to work. This will disable the http protocol and prevent the client from accessing the website. 

## Troubleshooting

If you run into a problem with the Visual Studio bootstrapper throwing an error when you pair it with a `response.json` file, see [Troubleshoot network-related errors when you install or use Visual Studio](../install/troubleshooting-network-related-errors-in-visual-studio.md#error-failed-to-parse-id-from-parent-process) page for more information.
