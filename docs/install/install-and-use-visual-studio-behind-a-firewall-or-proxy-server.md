# Install and use Visual Studio and Azure Services behind a firewall or proxy server

If you or your organization uses security measures such as a firewall or a proxy server, then there are domain URLs that you might want to add to an "allow list" and ports and protocols that you might want to open so that you have the best experience when you install and use Visual Studio and Azure Services.

* **[Install Visual Studio](#install-visual-studio)**: These tables include the domain URLs to add to an allow list so that you have access to all the components and workloads that you want.

* **[Use Visual Studio and Azure Services](#use-visual-studio-and-azure-services)**: This table includes the domain URLs to add to an allow list and the ports and protocols to open so that you have access to all the features and services that you want.

> [!NOTE]
> This article was written for Visual Studio on Windows, but certain information is also applicable to [installing Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/install-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server) behind a firewall or proxy server.

## Install Visual Studio

### URLs to add to an allow list

Because the Visual Studio Installer downloads files from various domains and their download servers, here are the domain URLs that you might want to add to an allow list as trusted in the UI or in your deployment scripts.

#### Microsoft domains

## Troubleshoot network-related errors

Sometimes, you might run in to network- or proxy-related errors when you install or use Visual Studio behind a firewall or a proxy server. For more information about solutions for such error messages, see the [Troubleshooting network-related errors when you install or use Visual Studio](troubleshooting-network-related-errors-in-visual-studio.md) page.

## Get support

We offer an [**installation chat**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only) support option for installation-related issues.

Here are a few more support options:

* Report product issues to us via the [Report a Problem](../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md) tool that appears both in the Visual Studio Installer and in the Visual Studio IDE.
* Suggest a feature, track product issues, and find answers in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/).
* Use your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to talk to us and other Visual Studio developers in the [Visual Studio conversation in the Gitter community](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/VisualStudio).
