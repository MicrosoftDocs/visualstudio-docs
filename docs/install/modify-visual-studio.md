# Modify Visual Studio 2017 by adding or removing workloads and components
Not only have we made is easier for you to personalize Visual Studio to match the tasks you want to accomplish, we've also made it easier to customize Visual Studio, too. No more looking in Control Panel to do so; instead, start the new Visual Studio Installer and make the changes you want.

Here's how.  

## Modify workloads  
 Workloads contain the features you need for the programming language or platform that you are using. Use workloads to modify Visual Studio so that it supports the work you want to do, when you want to do it.  

1.  Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.  

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10 Anniversary Update, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

     >[!NOTE]
     On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.<br/><br/> Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

2.  Click or tap to start the installer, and then select **Modify**.

3.  From the **Workloads** screen, select or deselect the workloads that you want to install or uninstall.

4. Click or tap **Modify** again.  

5. After the new workloads and components are installed, click **Launch**.

## Modify individual components

If you don't want to use the handy Workloads feature to customize your Visual Studio installation, choose the **Individual Components** option from the Visual Studio Installer, select what you want, and then follow the prompts.  

## Get support
Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see the [Troubleshooting Visual Studio 2017 installation and upgrade issues](troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) page for troubleshooting tips.
