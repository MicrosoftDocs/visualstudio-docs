## Get support

Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see [Troubleshoot Visual Studio installation and upgrade issues](../troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) for step-by-step guidance.

Here are a few more support options:
* We also offer an [installation chat](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only) support option for installation-related issues.
* Report product issues to us via the [Report a Problem](../../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md) tool that appears both in the Visual Studio Installer and in the Visual Studio IDE. If you're an IT Administrator and don't have Visual Studio installed, you can submit [IT Admin feedback here](https://aka.ms/vs/admin/feedback). 
* Suggest a feature, track product issues, and find answers in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://aka.ms/feedback/suggest?space=8).
