When you set dependencies in your VSIX manifest, you must specify Component IDs only. Use the tables on this page to determine the minimum component dependencies. In some scenarios, this might mean that you specify only one component from a workload. In other scenarios, it might mean that you specify multiple components from a single workload or multiple components from multiple workloads. For more information, see the [How to: Migrate extensibility projects to Visual Studio](../../extensibility/migration/update-visual-studio-extension.md) page.

For more information about how to use these IDs, see the [Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](../use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio.md) page. For a list of workload and component IDs for other products, see the [Visual Studio workload and component IDs](../workload-and-component-ids.md) page. Lastly, refer to the [Visual Studio out-of-support components](../out-of-support-components.md) page for a listing of those components that have transitioned to an out-of-support state and are now considered insecure. We recommend that you [remove them](../update-visual-studio.md#remove-out-of-support-components) during your next update.
