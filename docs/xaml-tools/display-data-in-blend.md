# Display data in Blend for Visual Studio

You can view sample data in your designer as you customize the layout of your pages. You can generate sample data from scratch or by using an existing class. You can also connect to *Live data* that appears in your app when you run it.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Data** panel in Blend is supported only for projects that target .NET Framework. It's not supported for UWP projects or projects that target .NET Core.

## Generate sample data

To generate sample data, open a XAML document. In the **Data** panel, choose the **Create sample data** ![Create sample data icon](../designers/media/30540d76-7256-43ce-b5d9-4b2edf3d339f.png) button, and then choose **New Sample Data**.

Define the structure of your data in the **Data** panel, and then bind it to UI elements on any page.

If you want your sample data to appear in your pages when you run the app, choose **Data source options** ![Data source options icon](../designers/media/ae1fd260-4f84-420d-b196-45fde357d81d.png), and then choose **Enable When Running Application**.

## Generate sample data from a class

If you've already created classes that describe the structure of your data, you can generate sample data from them.

To generate sample data from a class, open a XAML document, and then in the **Data** panel, click the **Create sample data** ![Create sample data icon](../designers/media/30540d76-7256-43ce-b5d9-4b2edf3d339f.png) button, and then click **Create Sample Data from Class**.
