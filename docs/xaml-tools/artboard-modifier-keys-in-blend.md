# Artboard modifier keys in Blend
Some keyboard shortcuts do not have associated menu items, which means that you can't use the [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../debugger/includes/blend_subs_md.md)] user interface to discover them. The following table lists shortcuts that modify an action, such as resizing an object.

|To do this action|Do this|
