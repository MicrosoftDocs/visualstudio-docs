# Artboard modifier keys in Blend
Some keyboard shortcuts do not have associated menu items, which means that you can't use the [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../debugger/includes/blend_subs_md.md)] user interface to discover them. The following table lists shortcuts that modify an action, such as resizing an object.

|To do this action|Do this|

|Temporarily select the **Selection** tool while a different tool remains selected (this reduces the number of times you have to click something in the **Tools** panel, going back and forth between the **Selection** tool and others)|Hold down **Ctrl**|
