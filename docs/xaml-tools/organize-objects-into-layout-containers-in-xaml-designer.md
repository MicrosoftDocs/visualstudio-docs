# Organize objects into layout containers in XAML Designer

This article describes layout panels and controls for XAML Designer.

Imagine where you'd like objects to appear on a page&mdash;objects such as images, buttons, and videos. Maybe you want them to appear in rows and columns, in a single line vertically or horizontally, or in fixed positions.

After you've had a chance to think about how the page might appear, choose a layout panel. All pages start with one because you need something to which you add your objects. By default it's a **Grid**, but you can change that.

Layout panels help you arrange objects on a page, but they do more than that. They help you design for different screen sizes and resolutions. When users run your app, everything in a layout panel resizes to match the screen real estate of their device. Of course, if you don't want your layout to do that, you can override that behavior for a part of the layout or the entire layout. You can use height and width properties to control that.

## Layout panels

Start your page by choosing one of these layout panels. Your page can have more than one. For example, you might start with a **Grid** layout panel, and then add a **StackPanel** to an area in the **Grid** so that you can arrange controls vertically in that element.

The following layout panels are the most popularly used, but there are others. You can find them all in **Toolbox** in Visual Studio or the **Assets** panel in Blend for Visual Studio.

### Grid

Arrange objects into rows and columns.

### UniformGrid

Arrange objects into equal, or uniform, grid regions. This panel is great for arranging a list of images.

(Available only for WPF projects.)

### Canvas

Arrange objects any way you want. When users run your app, these elements will have fixed positions on the screen.

### StackPanel

Arrange objects in a single line horizontally or vertically.

### WrapPanel

Arrange objects sequentially from left to right. When the panel runs out of room at the far-right edge, it *wraps* the content to the next line, and so on from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. You can also make the orientation of a wrap panel vertical so that objects flow from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

(Available only for WPF projects.)

### DockPanel

Arrange objects so that they stay, or *dock*, to one edge of the panel.

(Available only for WPF projects.)

## Layout controls

You can add your objects to layout controls as well. They aren't as feature-rich as a layout panel, but you might find them helpful for certain scenarios.

The following layout controls are the most popular, but there are others. You can find them all in **Toolbox** in Visual Studio or the **Assets** panel in Blend for Visual Studio.

### Border

Create a border, background, or both around an object. You can add only one object to a **Border**. If you want to apply a border or background for more than one object, add a layout panel to the **Border**. Then, add objects to that panel or control.

### Popup

Show information or options to users in a window. You can add only one object to a **Popup**. By default, a **Popup** contains a **Grid**, but you can change that.

### ScrollViewer

Enable users to scroll down a page or area of a page. You can add only one object to a **ScrollViewer**, so it makes sense to add a layout panel such as a **Grid** or **StackPanel**.

### Viewbox

Scale objects much like you would with a zoom control. You can add only one object to a **Viewbox**. If you want to apply that effect to more than one object, add a layout panel to the **ViewBox**, and then add your controls to that layout panel.
