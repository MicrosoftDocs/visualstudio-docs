# Extend the functionality of a TableAdapter

You can extend the functionality of a TableAdapter by adding code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.

The code that defines a TableAdapter is regenerated when any changes are made to the TableAdapter in the **Dataset Designer**, or when a wizard  modifies the configuration of a TableAdapter. To prevent your code from being deleted during the regeneration of a TableAdapter, add code to the TableAdapter's partial class file.

Partial classes allow code for a specific class to be divided among multiple physical files. For more information, see [Partial](/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/partial) or [partial (Type)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/partial-type).

## Locate TableAdapters in code

While TableAdapters are designed with the **Dataset Designer**, the TableAdapter classes that are generated are not  nested classes of <xref:System.Data.DataSet>. TableAdapters are located in a namespace based on the name of the TableAdapter's associated dataset. For example, if your application contains a dataset named `HRDataSet`, the TableAdapters would be located in the `HRDataSetTableAdapters` namespace. (The naming convention follows this pattern: *DatasetName* + `TableAdapters`).

The following example assumes a TableAdapter named `CustomersTableAdapter`is in a project with `NorthwindDataSet`.

### To create a partial class for a TableAdapter

1. Add a new class to your project by going to the **Project** menu and selecting **Add Class**.

2. Name the class `CustomersTableAdapterExtended`.

3. Select **Add**.

4. Replace the code with the correct namespace and partial class name for your project as follows:

     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/extend-the-functionality-of-a-tableadapter_1.cs)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataTableAdapters#2](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/extend-the-functionality-of-a-tableadapter_1.vb)]
