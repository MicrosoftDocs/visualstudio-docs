# The property \<property name> cannot be deleted

The property \<property name> cannot be deleted because it is set as the **Discriminator Property** for the inheritance between \<class name> and \<class name>

The selected property is set as the **Discriminator Property** for the inheritance between the classes indicated in the error message. Properties cannot be deleted if they are participating in the inheritance configuration between data classes.

Set the **Discriminator Property** to a different property of the data class to enable successful deletion of the desired property.

## To correct this error

1. In the **O/R Designer**, select the inheritance line that connects the data classes indicated in the error message.

2. Set the **Discriminator** Property to a different property.

3. Try to delete the property again.
