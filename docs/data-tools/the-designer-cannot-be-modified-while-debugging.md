# The designer cannot be modified while debugging

This message appears when an attempt is made to modify items on the **O/R Designer** when the application is running in debug mode. When the application is running in debug mode, the **O/R Designer** is read-only.

To correct this error, select **Stop Debugging** on the **Debug** menu. The application stops debugging, and  you can modify items in the **O/R Designer**.
