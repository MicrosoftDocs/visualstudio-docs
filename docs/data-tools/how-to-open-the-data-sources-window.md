# How to: Open the data sources window
The **Data Sources** window displays the data sources in your project. You use the **Data Sources** window to create a user interface of data-bound controls by dragging items from the window onto forms in your project. See [Bind Windows Forms controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-windows-forms-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
 You can populate the **Data Sources** window by running the **Data Source Configuration** Wizard. For more information see [Data Source Configuration Wizard](../data-tools/media/data-source-configuration-wizard.png).  
  
### To open the Data Sources window  
  
-   On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **Data Sources** (or choose the Shift+Alt+D keys).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You can add a data source to a project only if it supports creating and working with data sources. For example, you can't open the **Data Sources** window in a project for a Windows Store app.
