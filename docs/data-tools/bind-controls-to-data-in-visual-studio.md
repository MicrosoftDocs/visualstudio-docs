# Bind controls to data in Visual Studio

You can display data to users of your application by binding data to controls. You can create these data-bound controls by dragging items from the **Data Sources** window onto a design surface or controls on a surface in Visual Studio.

This topic describes the data sources you can use to create data-bound controls. It also describes some of the general tasks involved in data binding. For more specific details about how to create data-bound controls, see [Bind Windows Forms controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-windows-forms-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md) and [Bind WPF controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-wpf-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).

## Data sources

In the context of data binding, a data source represents the data in memory that can be bound to your user interface. In practical terms, a data source can be an Entity Framework class, a dataset, a service endpoint that is encapsulated in a .NET proxy object, a LINQ to SQL class, or any .NET object or collection. Some data sources enable you to create data-bound controls by dragging items from the **Data Sources** window, while other data sources do not. The following table shows which data sources are supported.

| Data source | Drag-and-drop support in **the Windows Forms Designer** | Drag-and-drop support in **the WPF Designer** | Drag-and-drop support in **the Silverlight Designer** |
| - | - | - | - |
| Dataset | Yes | Yes | No |
| Entity Data Model | Yes<sup>1</sup> | Yes | Yes |
| LINQ to SQL classes | No<sup>2</sup> | No<sup>2</sup> | No<sup>2</sup> |
| Services (including [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../data-tools/includes/ssastoria_md.md)], WCF services, and web services) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Object | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| SharePoint | Yes | Yes | Yes |

1. Generate the model using the **Entity Data Model** wizard, then drag those objects to the designer.

2. LINQ to SQL classes do not appear in the **Data Sources** window. However, you can add a new object data source that is based on LINQ to SQL classes, and then drag those objects to the designer to create data-bound controls. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating LINQ to SQL Classes (O-R Designer)](how-to-create-linq-to-sql-classes-mapped-to-tables-and-views-o-r-designer.md).

## Data Sources window

Data sources are available to your project as items in the **Data Sources** window. This window is visible when a form design surface is the active window in your project, or you can open it (when a project is open) by choosing **View** > **Other Windows** > **Data Sources**. You can drag items from this window to create controls that are bound to the underlying data, and you can also configure the data sources by right-clicking.

![Data Sources window](../data-tools/media/raddata-data-sources-window.png)

For each data type that appears in the **Data Sources** window, a default control is created when you drag the item to the designer. Before you drag an item from the **Data Sources** window, you can change the control that is created. For more information, see [Set the control to be created when dragging from the Data Sources window](../data-tools/set-the-control-to-be-created-when-dragging-from-the-data-sources-window.md).
