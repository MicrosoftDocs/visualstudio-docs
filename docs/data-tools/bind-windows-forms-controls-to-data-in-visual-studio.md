# Bind Windows Forms controls to data in Visual Studio

You can display data to users of your application by binding data to Windows Forms. To create these data-bound controls, drag items from the **Data Sources** window onto the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio.

![Data Source drag operation](../data-tools/media/raddata-data-source-drag-operation.png)

> [!TIP]
> If the **Data Sources** window is not visible, you can open it by choosing **View** > **Other Windows** > **Data Sources**, or by pressing **Shift**+**Alt**+**D**. You must have a project open in Visual Studio to see the **Data Sources** window.

Before you drag items, you can set the type of control you want to bind to. Different values appear depending on whether you choose the table itself, or an individual column.  You can also set custom values. For a table, **Details** means that each column is bound to a separate control.

## BindingSource and BindingNavigator controls

The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component serves two purposes. First, it provides a layer of abstraction when binding the controls to data. Controls on the form are bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component instead of directly to a data source. Second, it can manage a collection of objects. Adding a type to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> creates a list of that type.

For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, see:

- [BindingSource component](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/bindingsource-component)

- [BindingSource component overview](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/bindingsource-component-overview)

- [BindingSource component architecture](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/bindingsource-component-architecture)

The [BindingNavigator control](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/bindingnavigator-control-windows-forms) provides a user interface for navigating through data displayed by a Windows application.

## Bind to data in a DataGridView control

For a [DataGridView control](/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/datagridview-control-overview-windows-forms), the entire table is bound to that single control. When you drag a **DataGridView** to the form, a tool strip for navigating records (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>) also appears. A [DataSet](../data-tools/dataset-tools-in-visual-studio.md), [TableAdapter](../data-tools/create-and-configure-tableadapters.md), <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> appear in the component tray. In the following illustration, a [TableAdapterManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb384426.aspx) is also added because the Customers table has a relation to the Orders table. These variables are all declared in the auto-generated code as private members in the form class. The auto-generated code for filling the **DataGridView** is located in the `Form_Load` event handler. The code for saving the data to update the database is located in the `Save` event handler for the **BindingNavigator**. You can move or modify this code as needed.

![GridView with BindingNavigator](../data-tools/media/raddata-gridview-with-bindingnavigator.png)

You can customize the behavior of the **DataGridView** and the **BindingNavigator** by clicking on the smart tag in the upper-right corner of each:

![DataGridView and Binding Navigator smart tags](../data-tools/media/raddata-datagridview-and-binding-navigator-smart-tags.png)

If the controls your application needs are not available from within the **Data Sources** window, you can add controls. For more information, see [Add custom controls to the Data Sources window](../data-tools/add-custom-controls-to-the-data-sources-window.md).

You can also drag items from the **Data Sources** window onto controls already on a form to bind the control to data. A control that is already bound to data has its data bindings reset to the item most recently dragged onto it. To be valid drop targets, controls must be capable of displaying the underlying data type of the item dragged onto it from the **Data Sources** window. For example, it's not valid to drag an item that has a data type of <xref:System.DateTime> onto a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox>, because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> is not capable of displaying a date.

## Bind to data in individual controls

When you bind a data source to **Details**, each column in the dataset is bound to a separate control.

![Bind data source to details](../data-tools/media/raddata-bind-data-source-to-details.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that in the previous illustration, you drag from the Orders property of the Customers table, not from the Orders table. By binding to the `Customer.Orders` property, navigation commands made in the **DataGridView** are reflected immediately in the details controls. If you dragged from the Orders table, the controls would still be bound to the dataset, but not they would not be synchronized with the **DataGridView**.

The following illustration shows the default data-bound controls that are added to the form after the Orders property in the Customers table is bound to **Details** in the **Data Sources** window.

![Orders table bound to details](../data-tools/media/raddata-orders-table-bound-to-details.png)

Note also that each control has a smart tag. This tag enables customizations that apply to that control only.
