# Fill datasets by using TableAdapters

A TableAdapter component fills a dataset with data from the database, based on one or more queries or stored procedures that you specify. TableAdapters can also perform adds, updates, and deletes on the database to persist changes that you make to the dataset. You can also issue global commands that are unrelated to any specific table.

> [!NOTE]
> TableAdapters are generated by Visual Studio designers. If you are creating datasets programmatically, then use DataAdapter, which is a .NET class.

## TableAdapter overview

TableAdapters are designer-generated components that connect to a database, run queries or stored procedures, and fill their DataTable with the returned data. TableAdapters also send updated data from your application back to the database. You can run as many queries as you want on a TableAdapter as long as they return data that conforms to the schema of the table with which the TableAdapter is associated. The following diagram shows how TableAdapters interact with databases and other objects in memory:

![Data flow in a client application](../data-tools/media/clientdatadiagram.gif)

While TableAdapters are designed with the **Dataset Designer**, the TableAdapter classes are not generated as nested classes of  <xref:System.Data.DataSet>. They are located in separate namespaces that are specific to each dataset. For example, if you have a dataset named `NorthwindDataSet`, the TableAdapters that are associated with  <xref:System.Data.DataTable>s in the `NorthwindDataSet` would be in the `NorthwindDataSetTableAdapters` namespace. To access a particular TableAdapter programmatically, you must declare a new instance of the TableAdapter. For example:

[!code-csharp[VbRaddataTableAdapters#7](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/fill-datasets-by-using-tableadapters_1.cs)]
[!code-vb[VbRaddataTableAdapters#7](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/fill-datasets-by-using-tableadapters_1.vb)]

## Associated DataTable schema

When you create a TableAdapter, you use the initial query or stored procedure  to define the schema of the TableAdapter's associated <xref:System.Data.DataTable>. You run this initial query or stored procedure by calling the TableAdapter's `Fill` method (which fills the TableAdapter's associated <xref:System.Data.DataTable>). Any changes that are made to the TableAdapter's main query are reflected in the schema of the associated data table. For example, removing a column from the main query also removes the column from the associated data table. If any additional queries on the TableAdapter use SQL statements that return columns that are not in the main query, the designer attempts to synchronize the column changes between the main query and the additional queries.

## TableAdapter update commands

The update functionality of a TableAdapter is dependent on how much information is available in the main query  in the **TableAdapter Wizard**. For example, TableAdapters that are configured to fetch values from multiple tables (using a `JOIN`), scalar values, views, or the results of aggregate functions are not initially created with the ability to send updates back to the underlying database. However, you can configure the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands manually in the **Properties** window.

## TableAdapter queries

![TableAdapter with multiple queries](../data-tools/media/tableadapter.gif)

TableAdapters can contain multiple queries to fill their associated data tables. You can define as many queries for a TableAdapter as your application requires, as long as each query returns data that conforms to the same schema as its associated data table. This capability enables a TableAdapter to load different results based on differing criteria.

For example, if your application contains a table with customer names, you can create a query that fills the table with every customer name that begins with a certain letter, and another  that fills the table with all customers that are located in the same state. To fill a `Customers` table with customers in a given state, you can create a `FillByState` query that takes a parameter for the state value as follows: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE State = @State`. You run the query by calling the `FillByState` method and passing in the parameter value like this: `CustomerTableAdapter.FillByState("WA")`.

In addition to adding queries that return data of the same schema as the TableAdapter's data table, you can add queries that return scalar (single) values. For example, a query that returns a count of customers (`SELECT Count(*) From Customers`) is valid for a `CustomersTableAdapter,` even though the data that's returned doesn't conform to the table's schema.

## ClearBeforeFill property

By default, every time you run a query to fill a TableAdapter's data table, the existing data is cleared, and only the results of the query are loaded into the table. Set the TableAdapter's `ClearBeforeFill` property to `false` if you want to add or merge the data that's returned from a query to the existing data in a data table. Regardless of whether you clear the data, you need to explicitly send updates back to the database, if you want to persist them. So remember to save any changes  to the data in the table before running another query that fills the table. For more information, see [Update data by using a TableAdapter](../data-tools/update-data-by-using-a-tableadapter.md).

## TableAdapter inheritance

TableAdapters extend the functionality of standard data adapters by encapsulating a configured <xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter> class. By default, the TableAdapter inherits from the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component> class and can't be cast to the <xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter> class. Casting a TableAdapter to the <xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter> class results in an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> error. To change the base class of a TableAdapter, you can specify a class that derives from <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component> in the **Base Class** property of the TableAdapter in the **Dataset Designer**.

## TableAdapter methods and properties

The TableAdapter class is not a .NET type. This means you can't look it up in the documentation or the **Object Browser**. It's created at design time when you use one of the wizards mentioned earlier. The name that's assigned to a TableAdapter when you create it is based on the name of the table you are working with. For example, when you create a TableAdapter based on a table in a database named `Orders`, the TableAdapter is named `OrdersTableAdapter`. The class name of the TableAdapter can be changed using the **Name** property in the **Dataset Designer**.

Following are the commonly used methods and properties of TableAdapters:

|Member|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|`TableAdapter.Fill`|Populates the TableAdapter's associated data table with the results of the TableAdapter's `SELECT` command.|
|`TableAdapter.Update`|Sends changes back to the database and returns an integer that represents the number of rows affected by the update. For more information, see [Update data by using a TableAdapter](../data-tools/update-data-by-using-a-tableadapter.md).|
|`TableAdapter.GetData`|Returns a new <xref:System.Data.DataTable> that's filled with data.|
|`TableAdapter.Insert`|Creates a new row in the data table. For more information, see [Insert new records into a database](../data-tools/insert-new-records-into-a-database.md).|
|`TableAdapter.ClearBeforeFill`|Determines whether a data table is emptied before you call one of the `Fill` methods.|

## TableAdapter update method

TableAdapters use data commands to read to and write from the database. Use the TableAdapter's initial `Fill` (main) query as the basis for creating the schema of the associated data table, as well as the `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand` commands that are associated with the `TableAdapter.Update` method. Calling a TableAdapter's `Update` method runs the statements that were created when the TableAdapter was originally configured,  not one of the additional queries that you added with the **TableAdapter Query Configuration Wizard**.

When you use a TableAdapter, it effectively performs the same operations with the commands that you would typically perform. For example, when you call the adapter's `Fill` method, the adapter runs the data command in its `SelectCommand` property and uses a data reader (for example, <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader>) to load the result set into the data table. Similarly, when you call the adapter's `Update` method, it runs the appropriate command (in the `UpdateCommand`, `InsertCommand`, and `DeleteCommand` properties) for each changed record in the data table.

> [!NOTE]
> If there is enough information in the main query, the `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand` commands are created by default when the TableAdapter is generated. If the TableAdapter's main query is more than a single table `SELECT` statement, it's possible the designer won't be able to generate `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand`. If these commands aren't generated, you might receive an error when running the `TableAdapter.Update` method.

## TableAdapter GenerateDbDirectMethods

In addition to `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand`, TableAdapters are created with methods that you can run directly against the database. You can call these methods (`TableAdapter.Insert`, `TableAdapter.Update`, and `TableAdapter.Delete`) directly to manipulate data in the database. This means you can call these individual methods from your code instead of calling `TableAdapter.Update` to handle the inserts, updates, and deletes that are pending for the associated data table.

If you don't want to create these direct methods, set the TableAdapter's **GenerateDbDirectMethods** property to `false` (in the **Properties** window). Additional queries that are added to the TableAdapter are standalone queries — they don't generate these methods.

## TableAdapter support for nullable types

TableAdapters support nullable types `Nullable(Of T)` and `T?`. For more information about nullable types in Visual Basic, see [Nullable Value Types](/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types). For more information about nullable types in C#, see [Use nullable types](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/using-nullable-types).

## TableAdapterManager reference

By default, a TableAdapterManager class generates when you create a dataset that contains related tables. To prevent the class from being generated, change the value of the `Hierarchical Update` property of the dataset to false. When you drag a table that has a relation onto the design surface of a Windows Form or WPF page, Visual Studio declares a member variable of the class. If you don't use databinding, you have to manually declare the variable.

The TableAdapterManager class is not a .NET type. Therefore, you cannot look it up in the documentation. It's created at design time as part of the dataset creation process.

The following are the frequently used methods and properties of the `TableAdapterManager` class:

|Member|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|`UpdateAll` method|Saves all data from all data tables.|
|`BackUpDataSetBeforeUpdate` property|Determines whether to create a backup copy of the dataset before executing the `TableAdapterManager.UpdateAll` method.Boolean.|
|*tableName* `TableAdapter` property|Represents a TableAdapter. The generated TableAdapterManager contains a property for each `TableAdapter` it manages. For example, a dataset with a Customers and Orders table generates with a TableAdapterManager that contains `CustomersTableAdapter` and `OrdersTableAdapter` properties.|
|`UpdateOrder` property|Controls the order of the individual insert, update, and delete commands. Set this to one of the values in the `TableAdapterManager.UpdateOrderOption` enumeration.<br /><br /> By default, the `UpdateOrder` is set to **InsertUpdateDelete**. This means that inserts, then updates, and then deletes are performed for all tables in the dataset.|

## Security

When you use data commands with a CommandType property set to <xref:System.Data.CommandType.Text>, carefully check information that is sent from a client before passing it to your database. Malicious users might try to send (inject) modified or additional SQL statements in an effort to gain unauthorized access or damage the database. Before you transfer user input to a database, always verify that the information is valid. A best practice is to always use parameterized queries or stored procedures when possible.
