# How to: Save data by using a transaction

You save data in a transaction by using the <xref:System.Transactions> namespace. Use the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object to participate in a transaction that is automatically managed for you.

Projects are not created with a reference to the *System.Transactions* assembly, so you need to manually add a reference to projects that use transactions.

The easiest way to implement a transaction is to instantiate a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object in a `using` statement. (For more information, see [Using statement](/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement), and [Using statement](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement).) The code that runs within the `using` statement participates in the transaction.

To commit the transaction, call the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope.Complete%2A> method as the last statement in the using block.

To roll back the transaction, throw an exception prior to calling the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope.Complete%2A> method.

## To add a reference to the System.Transactions.dll

1. On the **Project** menu, select **Add Reference**.

2. On the **.NET** tab (**SQL Server** tab for SQL Server projects), select **System.Transactions**, and then select **OK**.

     A reference to *System.Transactions.dll* is added to the project.

## To save data in a transaction

- Add code to save data within the using statement that contains the transaction. The following code shows how to create and instantiate a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> object in a using statement:

     [!code-vb[VbRaddataSaving#11](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/save-data-by-using-a-transaction_1.vb)]
     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataSaving#11](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/save-data-by-using-a-transaction_1.cs)]
