# You have selected a database object from an unsupported database provider

The **O/R Designer** supports only the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server (<xref:System.Data.SqlClient>). Although you can click **OK** and continue to work with objects from unsupported database providers, you may experience unexpected behavior at run time.

> [!NOTE]
> Only data connections that use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server are supported.

## Options

- Click **OK** to continue designing the entity classes that map to the connection that uses the unsupported database provider. You might experience unexpected behavior when you use unsupported database providers.

- Click **Cancel** to stop the action. Create or use a different data connection that uses the .NET Framework Provider for SQL Server.
