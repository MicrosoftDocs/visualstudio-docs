# Filter and sort data in a .NET Framework Windows Forms application

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Data access tech note](./includes/data-technology-note.md)]

You filter data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to a string expression that returns the desired records.

You sort data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property to the column name on which you want to sort; append `DESC` to sort in descending order, or append `ASC` to sort in ascending order.

> [!NOTE]
> If your application does not use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components, you can filter and sort data by using <xref:System.Data.DataView> objects. For more information, see [DataViews](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/dataviews).

## To filter data by using a BindingSource component

- Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to the expression you want to return. For example, the following code returns customers with a `CompanyName` that starts with "B":

     ### [VB](#tab/vb)
     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataDisplaying/VB/Form1.vb" id="Snippet6":::

## To sort data by using a BindingSource component

- Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property to the column you want to sort on. For example, the following code sorts customers on the `CompanyName` column in descending order:

     ### [C#](#tab/csharp)
     :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataDisplaying/CS/Form1.cs" id="Snippet7":::

     ### [VB](#tab/vb)
     :::code language="vb" source="../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRaddataDisplaying/VB/Form1.vb" id="Snippet7":::
