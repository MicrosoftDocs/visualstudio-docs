# Filter and sort data in a Windows Forms application

You filter data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to a string expression that returns the desired records.

You sort data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property to the column name on which you want to sort; append `DESC` to sort in descending order, or append `ASC` to sort in ascending order.

> [!NOTE]
> If your application does not use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components, you can filter and sort data by using <xref:System.Data.DataView> objects. For more information, see [DataViews](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/dataviews).

## To filter data by using a BindingSource component

- Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to the expression you want to return. For example, the following code returns customers with a `CompanyName` that starts with "B":

     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataDisplaying#6](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_1.cs)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataDisplaying#6](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_1.vb)]

## To sort data by using a BindingSource component

- Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property to the column you want to sort on. For example, the following code sorts customers on the `CompanyName` column in descending order:

     [!code-csharp[VbRaddataDisplaying#7](../data-tools/codesnippet/CSharp/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_2.cs)]
     [!code-vb[VbRaddataDisplaying#7](../data-tools/codesnippet/VisualBasic/filter-and-sort-data-in-a-windows-forms-application_2.vb)]
