# How to: Connect to data in a service

You connect your application to the data returned from a service by running the [Data Source Configuration Wizard](../data-tools/media/data-source-configuration-wizard.png) and selecting **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page.

Upon completion of the wizard, a service reference is added to your project and is immediately available in the [Data Sources window](add-new-data-sources.md#data-sources-window).

> [!NOTE]
> The items that appear in the **Data Sources** window are dependent on the information that the service returns. Some services might not provide enough information for the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** to create bindable objects. For example, if the service returns an untyped dataset, no items appear in the **Data Sources** window upon completing the wizard. This is because untyped datasets do not provide schema, so the wizard does not have enough information to create the data source.

[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../data-tools/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]

## To connect your application to a service

1. On the **Data** menu, click **Add New Data Source**.

2. Select **Service** on the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, and then click **Next**.

3. Enter the address of the service you want to use, or click **Discover** to locate services in the current solution, and then click **Go**.

4. Optionally, you can type a new **Namespace** in place of the default value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Click **Advanced** to open the [Configure Service Reference dialog box](../data-tools/configure-service-reference-dialog-box.md).

5. Click **OK** to add a service reference to your project.

6. Click **Finish**.

     The data source is added to the **Data Sources** window.

## Next steps

To add functionality to your application, select an item in the **Data Sources** window and drag it onto a form to create bound controls. For more information, see [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](../data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio.md).
