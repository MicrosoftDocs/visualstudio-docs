# One or more selected items contain a data type that is not supported by the designer

One or more of the items dragged from **Server Explorer** or **Database Explorer** onto the **O/R Designer** contains a data type that is not supported by the **O/R Designer**, for example, [CLR user-defined types](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/clr-user-defined-types).

## To correct this error

1. Create a view that is based on the desired table and that does not include the unsupported data type.

2. Drag the view from **Server Explorer** or **Database Explorer** onto the designer.
