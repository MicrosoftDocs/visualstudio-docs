# Warning: Changes have been made to the Configure Behavior dialog box that have not been applied

Warning. Changes have been made to the Configure Behavior dialog box that have not been applied. Do you want to apply your changes?

The **Configure Behavior** dialog box enables you to configure `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` behavior for all classes available. This message appears when you select a new **Class** and **Behavior** combination and the previous change has not yet been applied.

## Change options

- To apply the change and continue, click **Yes**. The change is applied to the selected **Class** and **Behavior**.

- To cancel the previous change and continue, click **No**.
