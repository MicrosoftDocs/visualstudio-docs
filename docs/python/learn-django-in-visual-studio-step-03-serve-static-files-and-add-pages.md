# Step 3: Serve static files, add pages, and use template inheritance

**Previous step: [Create a Django app with views and page templates](learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-02-create-an-app.md)**

In the previous steps of this tutorial, you've learned how to create a minimal Django app with a single page of self-contained HTML. Modern web apps, however, are typically composed of many pages, and make use of shared resources like CSS and JavaScript files to provide consistent styling and behavior.

In this step, you learn how to:

> - Use Visual Studio item templates to quickly add new files of different types with convenient boilerplate code (step 3-1)
> - Configure the Django project to serve static files (step 3-2)
> - Add additional pages to the app (step 3-3)
> - Use template inheritance to create a header and nav bar that's used across pages (step 3-4)

## Step 3-1: Become familiar with item templates

As you develop a Django app, you typically add many more Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. For each file type (as well as other files like *web.config* that you may need for deployment), Visual Studio provides convenient [item templates](python-item-templates.md) to get you started.

To see available templates, go to **Solution Explorer**, right-click the folder in which you want to create the item, select **Add** > **New Item**:

![Add new item dialog in Visual Studio](media/django/step03-add-new-item-dialog.png)

To use a template, select the desired template, specify a name for the file, and select **OK**. Adding an item in this manner automatically adds the file to your Visual Studio project and marks the changes for source control.

### Question: How does Visual Studio know which item templates to offer?

Answer: The Visual Studio project file (*.pyproj*) contains a project type identifier that marks it as a Python project. Visual Studio uses this type identifier to show only those item templates that are suitable for the project type. This way, Visual Studio can supply a rich set of item templates for many project types without asking you to sort through them every time.

## Step 3-2: Serve static files from your app

In a web app built with Python (using any framework), your Python files always run on the web host's server and are never transmitted to a user's computer. Other files, however, such as CSS and JavaScript, are used exclusively by the browser, so the host server simply delivers them as-is whenever they're requested. Such files are referred to as "static" files, and Django can deliver them automatically without you needing to write any code.

A Django project is configured by default to serve static files from the app's *static* folder, thanks to these lines in the Django project's *settings.py*:

```python
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATIC_ROOT = posixpath.join(*(BASE_DIR.split(os.path.sep) + ['static']))
```

You can organize files using any folder structure within *static* that you like, and then use relative paths within that folder to refer to the files. To demonstrate this process, the following steps add a CSS file to the app, then use that stylesheet in the *index.html* template:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **HelloDjangoApp** folder in the Visual Studio project, select **Add** > **New folder**, and name the folder `static`.

1. Right-click the **static** folder and select **Add** > **New item**. In the dialog that appears, select the **Stylesheet** template, name the file `site.css`, and select **OK**. The **site.css** file appears in the project and is opened in the editor. Your folder structure should appear similar to the following image:

    ![Static file structure as shown in Solution Explorer](media/django/step03-static-file-structure.png)

1. Replace the contents of *site.css* with the following code and save the file:

    ```css
    .message {
        font-weight: 600;
        color: blue;
    }
    ```

1. Replace the contents of the app's *templates/HelloDjangoApp/index.html* file with the following code, which replaces the `<strong>` element used in step 2 with a `<span>` that references the `message` style class. Using a style class in this way gives you much more flexibility in styling the element. (If you haven't moved *index.html* into a subfolder in *templates* when using VS 2017 15.7 and earlier, refer to [template namespacing](learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-02-create-an-app.md#template-namespacing) in step 2-4.)

    ```html
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{{ title }}</title>
            {% load staticfiles %} <!-- Instruct Django to load static files -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'site.css' %}" />
        </head>
        <body>
            <span class="message">{{ message }}</span>{{ content }}
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Run the project to observe the results. Stop the server when done, and commit your changes to source control if you like (as explained in [step 2](learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-02-create-an-app.md#commit-to-source-control)).

### Question: What is the purpose of the {% load staticfiles %} tag?

Answer: The `{% load staticfiles %}` line is required before referring to static files in elements like `<head>` and `<body>`. In the example shown in this section, "staticfiles" refers to a custom Django template tag set, which is what allows you to use the `{% static %}` syntax to refer to static files.  Without `{% load staticfiles %}`, you'll see an exception when the app runs.

### Question: Are there any conventions for organizing static files?

Answer: You can add other CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files in your *static* folder however you want. A typical way to organize static files is to create subfolders named *fonts*, *scripts*, and *content* (for stylesheets and any other files). In each case, remember to include those folders in the relative path to the file in `{% static %}` references.

### Question: Can I complete the same task without using the {% load staticfiles %} tag?

Answer: Yes, you can.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{ title }}</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../static/site.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <span class="message">{{ message }}</span>{{ content }}
    </body>
</html>
```

## Step 3-3: Add a page to the app

Adding another page to the app means the following:

- Add a Python function that defines the view.
- Add a template for the page's markup.
- Add the necessary routing to the Django project's *urls.py* file.

The following steps add an "About" page to the "HelloDjangoApp" project, and links to that page from the home page:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **templates/HelloDjangoApp** folder, select **Add** > **New item**, select the **HTML Page** item template, name the file `about.html`, and select **OK**.

    > [!Tip]
    > If the **New Item** command doesn't appear on the **Add** menu, make sure that you've stopped the server so that Visual Studio exits debugging mode.

1. Replace the contents of *about.html* with the following markup (you replace the explicit link to the home page with a simple navigation bar in step 3-4):

    ```html
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{{ title }}</title>
            {% load staticfiles %}
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'site.css' %}" />
        </head>
        <body>
            <div><a href="home">Home</a></div>
            {{ content }}
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Open the app's *views.py* file and add a function named `about` that uses the template:

    ```python
    def about(request):
        return render(
            request,
            "HelloDjangoApp/about.html",
            {
                'title' : "About HelloDjangoApp",
                'content' : "Example app page for Django."
            }
        )
    ```

1. Open the Django project's *urls.py* file and add the following line to the `urlPatterns` array:

    ```python
    url(r'^about$', HelloDjangoApp.views.about, name='about'),
    ```

1. Open the *templates/HelloDjangoApp/index.html* file and add the following line below the `<body>` element to link to the About page (again, you replace this link with a nav bar in step 3-4):

    ```html
    <div><a href="about">About</a></div>
    ```

1. Save all the files using the **File** > **Save All** menu command, or just press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**S**. (Technically, this step isn't needed as running the project in Visual Studio saves files automatically. Nevertheless, it's a good command to know about!)

1. Run the project to observe the results and check navigation between pages. Close the server when done.

### Question: I tried using "index" for the link to the home page, but it didn't work. Why?

Answer: Even though the view function in *views.py* is named `index`, the URL routing patterns in the Django project's *urls.py* file does not contain a regular expression that matches the string "index". To match that string, you need to add another entry for the pattern `^index$`.

As shown in the next section, it's much better to use the `{% url '<pattern_name>' %}` tag in the page template to refer to the *name* of a pattern, in which case Django creates the proper URL for you. For example, replace `<div><a href="home">Home</a></div>` in *about.html* with `<div><a href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a></div>`. The use of 'index' works here because the first URL pattern in *urls.py* is, in fact, named 'index' (by virtue of the `name='index'` argument). You can also use 'home' to refer to the second pattern.

## Step 3-4: Use template inheritance to create a header and nav bar

Instead of having explicit navigation links on each page, modern web apps typically use a branding header and a navigation bar that provides the most important page links, popup menus, and so on. To make sure the header and nav bar are the same across all pages, however, you don't want to repeat the same code in every page template. You instead want to define the common parts of all your pages in one place.

Django's templating system provides two means for reusing specific elements across multiple templates: includes and inheritance.

- *Includes* are other page templates that you insert at a specific place in the referring template using the syntax `{% include <template_path> %}`. You can also use a variable if you want to change the path dynamically in code. Includes are typically used in the body of a page to pull in the shared template at a specific location on the page.

- *Inheritance* uses the `{% extends <template_path> %}` at the beginning of a page template to specify a shared base template that the referring template then builds upon. Inheritance is commonly used to define a shared layout, nav bar, and other structures for an app's pages, such that referring templates need only add or modify specific areas of the base template called *blocks*.

In both cases, `<template_path>` is relative to the app's *templates* folder (`../` or `./` are also allowed).

A base template delineates blocks using `{% block <block_name> %}` and `{% endblock %}` tags. If a referring template then uses tags with the same block name, its block content override that of the base template.

The following steps demonstrate inheritance:

1. In the app's *templates/HelloDjangoApp* folder, create a new HTML file (using the **Add** > **New item** context menu or **Add** > **HTML Page**) called *layout.html*, and replace its contents with the markup below. You can see that this template contains a block named "content" that is all that the referring pages need to replace:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>{{ title }}</title>
        {% load staticfiles %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'site.css' %}" />
    </head>

    <body>
        <div class="navbar">
           <a href="/" class="navbar-brand">Hello Django</a>
           <a href="{% url 'home' %}" class="navbar-item">Home</a>
           <a href="{% url 'about' %}" class="navbar-item">About</a>
        </div>

        <div class="body-content">
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
            <hr/>
            <footer>
                <p>&copy; 2018</p>
            </footer>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Add the following styles to the app's *static/site.css* file (this walkthrough isn't attempting to demonstrate responsive design here; these styles are simply to generate an interesting result):

    ```css
    .navbar {
        background-color: lightslategray;
        font-size: 1em;
        font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
        color: white;
        padding: 8px 5px 8px 5px;
    }

    .navbar a {
        text-decoration: none;
        color: inherit;
    }

    .navbar-brand {
        font-size: 1.2em;
        font-weight: 600;
    }

    .navbar-item {
        font-variant: small-caps;
        margin-left: 30px;
    }

    .body-content {
        padding: 5px;
        font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
    }
    ```

1. Modify *templates/HelloDjangoApp/index.html* to refer to the base template and override the content block. You can see that by using inheritance, this template becomes simple:

    ```html
    {% extends "HelloDjangoApp/layout.html" %}
    {% block content %}
    <span class="message">{{ message }}</span>{{ content }}
    {% endblock %}
    ```

1. Modify *templates/HelloDjangoApp/about.html* to also refer to the base template and override the content block:

    ```html
    {% extends "HelloDjangoApp/layout.html" %}
    {% block content %}
    {{ content }}
    {% endblock %}
    ```

1. Run the server to observe the results. Close the server when done.

1. Because you'd made substantial changes to the app, it's again a good time to [commit your changes to source control](learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-02-create-an-app.md#commit-to-source-control).
