# Quickstart: Create a Python project from existing code

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

Once you've [installed Python support in Visual Studio](installing-python-support-in-visual-studio.md), it's easy to bring existing Python code into a Visual Studio project.

> [!Important]
> The process described here does not move or copy the original source files. If you want to work with a copy, duplicate the folder first.

[!INCLUDE[project-from-existing](includes/project-from-existing.md)]

If desired, run the program by pressing **Ctrl**+**F5** or selecting **Debug** > **Start without Debugging**.
