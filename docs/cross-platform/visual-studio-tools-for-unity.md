# Visual Studio Tools for Unity
In this section, you'll learn about Visual Studio Tools for Unity, a free Visual Studio extension that makes Visual Studio a powerful tool for building games with Unity.  
  
## Visual Studio Tools for Unity  
 **Unity** is a game engine and development environment for creating cross-platform games. The Unity engine runs on over a dozen platforms spanning from powerful PCs, to game consoles, to touch-enabled tablets and mobile phones—even to the web. The Unity editor provides a friendly interface for building rich game worlds. The capability, ease-of-use, and reach of Unity make it a popular choice among today's game developers.  
  
 While the Unity editor is great for putting your game world together, you can't write your code in it. With **Visual Studio Tools for Unity**, you can use the familiar code editing, debugging and productivity features of Visual Studio to create editor and game scripts for your Unity project using C#, and you can debug them using Visual Studio's powerful debugging capabilities.  
  
 But Visual Studio Tools for Unity is more than that; it also has deep integration with Unity editor so that you'll spend less time switching back and forth to do simple tasks, provides Unity-specific productivity enhancements, and puts the Unity documentation at your fingertips.
