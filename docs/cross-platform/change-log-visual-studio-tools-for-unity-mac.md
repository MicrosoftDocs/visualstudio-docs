  - Added a quick tooltip for fields tagged with `TooltipAttribute`. (This will work for a simple get accessor using this field as well).

## 2.3.3.0

Released September 23, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Added a new suppressor for IDE0060, to prevent the IDE from showing a quick-fix to remove unused parameters.
    - `USP0005` for `IDE0060`: Unity messages are invoked by the Unity runtime.

## 2.3.2.0

Released September 16, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - We've deepened the understanding that Visual Studio has for Unity projects by adding new diagnostics specific to Unity. We've also made the IDE smarter by suppressing general C# diagnostics that don't apply to Unity projects. For example, the IDE won't show a quick-fix to change an inspector variable to `readonly` which would prevent you from modifying the variable in the Unity Editor.
    - `UNT0001`: Unity messages are called by the runtime even if they are empty, do not declare them to avoid uncesseray processing by the Unity runtime.
    - `UNT0002`: Tag comparison using string equality is slower than the built-in CompareTag method.
    - `UNT0003`: Usage of the generic form of GetComponent is preferred for type safety.
    - `UNT0004`: Update message is frame-rate dependent, and should use Time.deltaTime instead of Time.fixedDeltaTime.
    - `UNT0005`: FixedUpdate message is frame-rate independent, and should use Time.fixedDeltaTime instead of Time.deltaTime.
    - `UNT0006`: An incorrect method signature was detected for this Unity message.
    - `UNT0007`: Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects which is incompatible with null coalescing.
    - `UNT0008`: Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects which is incompatible with null propagation.
    - `UNT0009`: When applying the InitializeOnLoad attribute to a class, you need to provide a static constructor. InitializeOnLoad attribute ensures that it will be called as the editor launches.
    - `UNT0010`: MonoBehaviours should only be created using AddComponent(). MonoBehaviour is a component, and needs to be attached to a GameObject.
    - `UNT0011`: ScriptableObject should only be created using CreateInstance(). ScriptableObject needs to be created by the Unity engine to handle Unity message methods.
    - `USP0001` for `IDE0029`: Unity objects should not use null coalescing.
    - `USP0002` for `IDE0031`: Unity objects should not use null propagation.
    - `USP0003` for `IDE0051`: Unity messages are invoked by the Unity runtime.
    - `USP0004` for `IDE0044`: Fields with a SerializeField attribute should not be made readonly.

## 2.3.1.0

Released September 4, 2019

### New Features

- **Evaluation:**

  - Added support for better type display, i.e. `List<object>` instead of `List'1[[System.Object, <corlib...>]]`.

  - Added support for pointer member access, i.e. `p->data->member`.

  - Added support for implicit conversions in array initializers, i.e. `new byte [] {1,2,3,4}`.

  - Added support for hex editor when inspecting byte arrays and strings.

## 2.3.0.0

Released August 13, 2019

### Bug fixes

- **Evaluation:**

  - Fixed stepping issues with exceptions.

  - Fixed evaluation of pseudo identifiers (like $exception).

  - Prevent crash when dereferencing invalid addresses.

## 2.2.0.0

Released July 25, 2019

- **Evaluation:**

  - Fixed inspection with IntPtr types.

- **Debugger:**

  - Fixed handling of catchpoints and function breakpoints.

## 2.1.3.0

Released July 9, 2019

  - Added support for catching subclasses of exceptions.

  - Added support for MDS protocol 2.51.

- **Integration:**

  - Added support for asmdef files.

  - Switch to rename mode when a file is added from a template (to mimic the Unity Editor behavior).

### Bug fixes

- **Integration:**

  - Fixed handling of malformed messages while communicating with Unity Players.

- **Evaluation:**

  - Fixed handling of namespaces in expressions.

## 2.1.2.0

Released July 2, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Updated MonoBehaviour API to 2019.1.

### Bug fixes

- **Integration:**

  - Fixed Unity Project Explorer performance.

  - Fixed reporting warnings and errors to output when lightweight build is enabled.

  - Fixed lightweight build performance.

## 2.1.0.0

Released June 20, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Disabled the full build for Unity projects, in favor of using the IntelliSense errors and warnings. Indeed Unity creates a Visual Studio solution with class library projects that represent what Unity is doing internally. That being said, the result of the build in Visual Studio is never used or picked up by Unity as their compilation pipeline is closed. Building in Visual Studio is just consuming resources for nothing. If you need a full build because you have tools or a setup that depends on it, you can disable this optimization (Settings/Tools for Unity/Disable the full build of projects).
  
  - Added support for Unity packages in the UPE. Only Referenced packages (using manifest.json in the `Packages` folder) and Local packages (embedded in the `Packages` folder) are visible.

## 2.0.2.1

Released May 30, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Added custom icon for Unity execution targets.

## 2.0.2.0

Released April 2, 2019

- **Integration:**

  - Added support for automatically refreshing Unity's asset database on save. This is enabled by default and will trigger a recompilation on the Unity side when saving a script in Visual Studio. You can disable this feature in Tools\Options\Tools for Unity\Refresh Unity's AssetDatabase on save.

  - Added support for setting preferred unity installation for offline documentation.

  - Added context menu for the new Editor.
