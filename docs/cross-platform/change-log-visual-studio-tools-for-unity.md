## 4.3.3.0

Released September 23, 2019

### Bug fixes

- **Integration:**

  - Fixed error and warning reporting for lightweight builds.

## 4.3.2.0

Released September 16, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - We've deepened the understanding that Visual Studio has for Unity projects by adding new diagnostics specific to Unity. We've also made the IDE smarter by suppressing general C# diagnostics that don't apply to Unity projects. For example, the IDE won't show a quick-fix to change an inspector variable to `readonly` which would prevent you from modifying the variable in the Unity Editor.
    - [`UNT0001`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0001.md): Unity messages are called by the runtime even if they are empty, do not declare them to avoid uncesseray processing by the Unity runtime.
    - [`UNT0002`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0002.md): Tag comparison using string equality is slower than the built-in CompareTag method.
    - [`UNT0003`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0003.md): Usage of the generic form of GetComponent is preferred for type safety.
    - [`UNT0004`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0004.md): Update message is frame-rate dependent, and should use Time.deltaTime instead of Time.fixedDeltaTime.
    - [`UNT0005`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0005.md): FixedUpdate message is frame-rate independent, and should use Time.fixedDeltaTime instead of Time.deltaTime.
    - [`UNT0006`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0006.md): An incorrect method signature was detected for this Unity message.
    - [`UNT0007`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0007.md): Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects which is incompatible with null coalescing.
    - [`UNT0008`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0008.md): Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects which is incompatible with null propagation.
    - [`UNT0009`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0009.md): When applying the InitializeOnLoad attribute to a class, you need to provide a static constructor. InitializeOnLoad attribute ensures that it will be called as the editor launches.
    - [`UNT0010`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0010.md): MonoBehaviours should only be created using AddComponent(). MonoBehaviour is a component, and needs to be attached to a GameObject.
    - [`UNT0011`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/UNT0011.md): ScriptableObject should only be created using CreateInstance(). ScriptableObject needs to be created by the Unity engine to handle Unity message methods.
    - [`USP0001`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/USP0001.md) for `IDE0029`: Unity objects should not use null coalescing.
    - [`USP0002`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/USP0002.md) for `IDE0031`: Unity objects should not use null propagation.
    - [`USP0003`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/USP0003.md) for `IDE0051`: Unity messages are invoked by the Unity runtime.
    - [`USP0004`](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/blob/master/doc/USP0004.md) for `IDE0044`: Fields with a SerializeField attribute should not be made readonly.

## 4.3.1.0

Released September 4, 2019

### New Features

- **Evaluation:**

  - Added support for better type display, i.e. `List<object>` instead of `List'1[[System.Object, <corlib...>]]`.

  - Added support for pointer member access, i.e. `p->data->member`.

  - Added support for implicit conversions in array initializers, i.e. `new byte [] {1,2,3,4}`.

## 4.3.0.0

Released August 13, 2019

### New Features

- **Debugger:**

  - Added support for MDS protocol 2.51.

- **Integration:**

  - Improved the "Attach To Unity instance" window with sort, search and refresh features. PID is now displayed even for local players (by querying listening sockets on the system to retrieve the owning process).

  - Added support for asmdef files.

### Bug fixes

  - Fixed handling of malformed messages while communicating with Unity Players.

- **Evaluation:**

  - Fixed handling of namespaces in expressions.

  - Fixed inspection with IntPtr types.
  
  - Fixed stepping issues with exceptions.

  - Fixed evaluation of pseudo identifiers (like $exception).

  - Prevent crash when dereferencing invalid addresses.  

  - Fixed issue with unloaded appdomains.

## 4.2.0.1

Released July 24, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Added a new option to create any type of files from the Unity Project Explorer.
  
  - Improve diagnostic caching when using fast builds for Unity projects.

- **Integration:**

  - Updated MonoBehaviour API to 2019.1.

### Bug fixes

- **Integration:**

  - Fixed reporting warnings and errors to output when lightweight build is enabled.

  - Fixed lightweight build performance.

## 4.1.0.0

Released May 21, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Added support for the new batch API to reload projects faster.

  - Disabled the full build for Unity projects, in favor of using the IntelliSense errors and warnings. Indeed Unity creates a Visual Studio solution with class library projects that represent what Unity is doing internally. That being said, the result of the build in Visual Studio is never used or picked up by Unity as their compilation pipeline is closed. Building in Visual Studio is just consuming resources for nothing. If you need a full build because you have tools or a setup that depends on it, you can disable this optimization (Tools/Options/Tools for Unity/Disable the full build of projects).

  - Automatically show the Unity Project Explorer (UPE) when a Unity project is loaded. The UPE will be docked next to the Solution Explorer.

  - Updated project name extraction mechanism with Unity 2019.x.

  - Added support for Unity packages in the UPE. Only Referenced packages (using manifest.json in the `Packages` folder) and Local packages (embedded in the `Packages` folder) are visible.

- **Project Generation:**

  - Preserve external properties when processing the solution file.

- **Evaluation:**

  - Added support for alias-qualified names (only the global namespace for now). So the expression evaluator is now accepting types using the form global::namespace.type.

  - Added support for `pointer[index]` form, which is semantically identical to pointer dereference `*(pointer+index)` form.

### Bug fixes

- **Integration:**

  - Fixed dependency issues with Microsoft.VisualStudio.MPF.

  - Fixed UWP player attach, without any project loaded.

  - Fixed automatic asset database refresh when Visual Studio was not yet attached.

  - Fixed theme issues with labels and checkboxes.

- **Debugger:**

  - Fixed stepping with static constructors.

  - Updated the `ScriptableObject` API.

## 4.0.0.3

Released January 31, 2019

### New Features

- **Integration:**

  - Improved the user experience for displaying Unity editor and player instances (windows are now resizable, use uniform margins and display a resizing grip). Added Process-Id information for Unity editors.

  - Updated the `MonoBehaviour` API.

- **Evaluation:**

  - Added support for local functions.

  - Added support for pseudo variables (exception and object identifiers).

## 4.0.0.1

Released December 10, 2018

### New Features

- **Evaluation:**

  - Replaced NRefactory in favor of Roslyn for expression evaluation.

  - Added support for pointers: dereference, casting and pointer arithmetic (both Unity 2018.2+ and the new runtime are required for this).

  - Added support for array pointer view (like in C++). Take a pointer expression then append a comma and the number of elements you want to see.

  - Added support for async constructs.

- **Integration:**

  - Added support for automatically refreshing Unity's asset database on save. This is enabled by default and will trigger a recompilation on the Unity side when saving a script in Visual Studio. You can disable this feature in Tools\Options\Tools for Unity\Refresh Unity's AssetDatabase on save.

### Bug fixes

  - Fixed bridge activation when Visual Studio is not selected as the preferred external editor.

  - Fixed expression evaluation with malformed or unsupported expressions.

## 4.0.0.0
