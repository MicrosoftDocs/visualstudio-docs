> [!IMPORTANT]
>  C# being the predominant language in the Unity ecosystem - the new Sample Assets are in C#, the Unity documentation will default to C# - we removed our basic support for UnityScript and Boo to better focus on the C# experience. As a result, VSTU solutions are now C# only and are much faster to load.

-   Work around a Unity scripting engine bug, so the debugger won't break on non properly registered threads.  
  
-   Rework the file opener to avoid a race condition in VS where it claimed to be able to open files, while crashing on the file open request.  
  
-   UnityVS is now asking to refresh the build when VS is building the project, and not on file save anymore.

 Released 2014-10-09  
  
## 1.0.13  
 Released 2013-01-21  
  
### Bug fixes  
  
-   Fixed a Visual Studio lockup that could happen if the target debuggee is sending invalid thread events. That would typically happen when debugging a remote Unity on OSX.  
  
-   Fixed a Visual Studio lockup that could happen if an exception shuts down the debugger.

-   Fixed keyboard navigation in the Unity Project Explorer.  
  
-   Fixed UnityScript colorization for escaped strings.  
  
-   Fixed our file opener to guess better the project name when used outside of Unity. That's necessary when the user uses a third part file opener in Unity that delegates to UnityVS.  
  
-   Fixed handling of long messages sent from Unity to UnityVS. Before that, long messages could crash our messaging part of UnityVS. As a consequence, sometimes UnityVS wouldn't open a file from Unity.

The UnityVS package to import Unity is now named either UnityVS 2010 or UnityVS 2012, for respectively Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012. This version also requires that the UnityVS project files are regenerated.
