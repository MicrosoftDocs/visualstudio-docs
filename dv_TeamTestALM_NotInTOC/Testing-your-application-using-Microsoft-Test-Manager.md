# Testing your application using Microsoft Test Manager
Use Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) to help you test the application you built. MTM stores your test plans and results on Team Foundation Server (TFS).  
  
 **Should I use Microsoft Test Manager or the web portal?**  
  
 If you don’t need all the features of Microsoft Test Manager, you can use the web portal to [plan](../dv_TeamTestALM/Planning-manual-tests-using-the-web-portal.md) and [run](../dv_TeamTestALM/Running-manual-tests-using-the-web-portal.md) your tests.  
  
 The web portal lets you create test cases and organize them into test plans and suites. When you perform a test, the web portal displays the test steps and lets you mark which steps passed or failed.  
  
 In addition, Microsoft Test Manager can record your actions, screenshots, Intellitrace logs and other diagnostic data. It also lets you manage lab environments.  
  
 But you don’t have to decide upfront - you can always use either tool to edit your test plans or run your tests.  
  
 **Where do I get Microsoft Test Manager?**  
  
 It’s installed with Visual Studio Enterprise and Visual Studio Test Professional.  
  
## What you can do with Microsoft Test Manager  
 Go to one of the topics below for how-to information.
