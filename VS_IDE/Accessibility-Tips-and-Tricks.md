# Accessibility Tips and Tricks
Visual Studio includes built-in accessibility features so you can easily work from the keyboard and use screen readers or other assistive technology devices. The topic includes some suggestions for optimizing Visual Studio for accessibility as well as some useful shortcut key combinations.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Save Your IDE Settings  
 You can customize your IDE experience by saving your window layout, keyboard mapping scheme, and other preferences for use on your current computer and on other computers. For more information, see [How to: Share Settings Between Computers](assetId:///1131fb10-35c1-42da-9cd8-91aa3235b882) and [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).
