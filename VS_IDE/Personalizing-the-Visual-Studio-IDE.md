# Personalizing the Visual Studio IDE
This section describes how to personalize Visual Studio in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define a layout for coding and one for debugging. You can customize colors, fonts and formatting in the code editor for each language. You can choose between the blue, dark or light environment color themes, or you can create custom themes by downloading and installing the Visual Studio 2015 theme editor from the Visual Studio Code Gallery. Many other options are also exposed through the [Environment Options Dialog Box](../VS_IDE/Environment-Options-Dialog-Box.md).  
  
 Many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances. See [Synchronized Settings](../VS_IDE/Synchronized-Settings-in-Visual-Studio.md) for more information.  
  
 Insert section body here.  
  
### Window layouts  
 To arrange window positions and behavior, and save custom layouts, see [Customizing window layouts](../VS_IDE/Customizing-window-layouts-in-Visual-Studio.md).  
  
### General environment options  
 To customize many environment settings, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch**. When the property page appears, you can press  **F1** for more help on the various settings on that page. See also [Environment Options Dialog Box](../VS_IDE/Environment-Options-Dialog-Box.md).  
  
### External tools  
 To customize which external tools appear in menus and toolbars, see [Managing External Tools](../VS_IDE/Managing-External-Tools.md).  
  
### Start page  
 To create a custom start page for you and your team, see [Customizing the Start Page](../VS_IDE/Customizing-the-Start-Page-for-Visual-Studio.md)  
  
### Environment color themes  
 To change the color theme between light, dark and blue, type environment in **QuickLaunch** and choose **Environment &#124; General**. To change colorization options in the editor, type `environment` in **QuickLaunch** and choose **Environment &#124; Fonts and Colors**. see also [How to: Change Fonts and Colors](../VS_IDE/How-to--Change-Fonts-and-Colors-in-Visual-Studio.md).  
  
### Menus and toolbars  
 To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [How to: Customize Menus and Toolbars](../VS_IDE/How-to--Customize-Menus-and-Toolbars-in-Visual-Studio.md).  
  
### Main menu casing  
 Due to popular demand, you can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** and **ALL CAPS** by typing `environment` in **QuickLaunch** and choosing **Environment &#124; General**.
