# How to: Export Class Diagrams As Images (Class Designer)
To export a class diagram that you created from code in a project, save the diagram as an image. If you want to export UML class diagrams instead, see [Export diagrams as images](../VS_IDE/Export-diagrams-as-images.md).  
  
1.  Open your class diagram (.cd) file.  
  
2.  From the **Class Diagram** menu or the diagram surface shortcut menu, choose **Export Diagram as Image**.  
  
3.  Select a diagram.  
  
4.  Select the format that you want.  
  
5.  Choose **Export** to finish exporting.  
  
     To automatically update exported images that are linked from other documents, export the diagram again in Visual Studio.
