# Writing User Commands and Actions
You can customize a domain-specific language by adding commands to the diagram, and by responding to gestures such as drag-and-drop, click, and double-click events.  
  
## User actions  
  
-   [How to: Modify a Standard Menu Command](../VS_IDE/How-to--Modify-a-Standard-Menu-Command-in-a-Domain-Specific-Language.md) – You can customize the behavior of commands such as copy and print.  
  
-   [How to: Add a Command to the Shortcut Menu](../VS_IDE/How-to--Add-a-Command-to-the-Shortcut-Menu.md) – Create your own commands that can update your model or external resources.  
  
-   [How to: Add a Drag-and-Drop Handler](../VS_IDE/How-to--Add-a-Drag-and-Drop-Handler.md) – Allow the user to move items from one diagram to another, including UML diagrams. You can store references to one model in another.  
  
-   [How to: Intercept a Click on a Shape or Decorator](../VS_IDE/How-to--Intercept-a-Click-on-a-Shape-or-Decorator.md) – Allow your user to click through from an item to another item that it references.  
  
-   [How to: Program Copy and Paste Behavior - redirect](../VS_not_in_toc/How-to--Program-Copy-and-Paste-Behavior---redirect.md) – How to use ElementOperations.
