2.  In the Code Editor, select text to surround.

3.  From the **Edit** menu, select **IntelliSense** and then select the **Surround With** command.  
  
4.  Select the code snippet from the code snippet inserter and then press TAB or ENTER.  
  
     Alternatively, you can type the name of the code snippet, and then press TAB or ENTER.
