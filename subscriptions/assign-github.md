# Manage Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise
Customers who have Enterprise Agreements (EA) with Microsoft are eligible to purchase a new subscription offer that brings together Visual Studio standard subscriptions and GitHub Enterprise. It's the easy and economical way for Visual Studio subscribers to acquire GitHub Enterprise. 

When your organization purchases Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, they are provisioned and managed in two parts.

## Manage Visual Studio subscriptions
When your organization purchases Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, the Visual Studio portion of the subscriptions is provisioned immediately, and the subscriptions are available for assignment and management in the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration](https://manage.visualstudio.com) portal. After you assign a Visual Studio subscription with GitHub Enterprise, the subscriber will receive an email letting them know they can access their Visual Studio subscription at <https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions>.

For more information about managing Visual Studio subscriptions, check out these topics:
- [Using the Admin Portal](using-admin-portal.md)
- [Assign Subscriptions](assign-license.md)
- [Edit Subscriptions](edit-license.md)
- [Delete Subscriptions](delete-license.md)
- [Overallocations](handle-overclaimed-license.md)

> [!Important]
> If Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise are assigned by Visual Studio subscription admins without purchasing first, GitHub will not be notified that you wish to create a GitHub Enterprise account.  **A purchase of at least one** Visual Studio subscription with GitHub Enterprise should be made before subscriptions are assigned.

## Moving to Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise
If your organization purchases Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise bundles after standard Visual Studio Enterprise and Visual Studio Professional subscriptions have been assigned, the admin portal contains a feature to help you move your existing subscribers to the corresponding Visual Studio Enterprise with GitHub Enterprise and/or Visual Studio Professional with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions.  For example, subscribers with Visual Studio Professional subscriptions will move to Visual Studio Professional with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions. In the left bar “Overview” panel you will see the following tile:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Move Now button](_img/assign-github/move-now.png "Click 'Move Now' to upgrade subscriptions to Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As mentioned above, existing subscriber data, history, and subscription ID will be maintained and any benefits they’ve activated won’t be interrupted because of this move.  
>
> This feature is being deployed in phases and may not be immediately available on your agreement(s).

When you click the **Move Now** button, a fly-out panel will present you with recommendations on moving your Enterprise and/or Professional subscriptions:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Fly out panel](_img/assign-github/fly-out.png)

In this tile, you can review the impacted subscribers and specify whether you would like to notify them to receive an email notification after the move is complete.  This email informs subscribers that their benefits remain unchanged and encourages them to begin setting up a presence in GitHub.  

After clicking the **Move all subscribers** button, you will confirm your selections and wait a few seconds for the subscription move to complete.  If applicable, you will need to perform these steps for Professional and Enterprise separately.  


## What is the Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise setup process?
GitHub Enterprise is set up and managed separately from Visual Studio subscriptions. Following a Visual Studio subscription with GitHub Enterprise purchase, a GitHub Enterprise account setup process is initiated in parallel with (but separate from) establishing an agreement in [manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Establishing this GitHub Enterprise account may take some time. 

After your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, subscribers who have been assigned Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise will receive an email from GitHub notifying them that their Visual Studio subscriptions have been linked. After subscribers receive this email, they can reach out to their GitHub organization admin to receive an invitation to the appropriate organization.

For details on GitHub Enterprise setup, please reference the [subscriber documentation](access-github.md).   

## Manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions
When GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are purchased, GitHub partners with customers to help create and configure the organizations that will access GitHub and identify admins.  Those admins then receive a notification that they've been set up as admins.  

Since this process is more complex, it may take several days after subscriptions are purchased for the organizations and admins to be fully set up.

GitHub is available as either the cloud-based GitHub.com, or on-premise GitHub Enterprise Server.  The processes for managing the two versions differ.  GitHub provides various help topics and admin guides to help you manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions.  We've provided links to selected topics below.
