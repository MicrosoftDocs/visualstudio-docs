# Edit Visual Studio subscription assignments
As a subscription administrator, you can make changes to the subscriptions assigned to individuals within your organization.  This article discusses the types of changes you can make and provides the necessary steps.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you need to change subscription details for a subscriber assigned through an Azure Active Directory Group, you will need to remove them from the group and add them into the Administration Portal individually.  

## Change subscriber information
You can edit a subscriber’s information to correct errors or update information.

To edit a subscriber, select the ellipses (…) that appear next to the subscriber’s email address when you hover your mouse over it. A dropdown will appear.  Select **Edit** to modify the subscriber’s details. 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Select subscriber to edit](_img/edit-license/select-subscriber.png)

You can update the subscriber’s first name, last name, subscription level, email address, country, language, downloads and reference field. Edit the subscriber’s information, and click **Save**.

## Edit multiple subscribers using bulk edit


You can edit multiple subscribers at once using the bulk edit process. This feature is primarily used for organizations that are going through corporate email address changes or if an organization has decided to restrict access to downloads.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Subscription levels (i.e. Enterprise, Professional, etc.) and subscription GUIDs cannot be altered using Bulk edit.  If you need to assign specific subscription GUIDs to you users, use the process for adding users by choosing the subscription ID. If you attempt an upload with these items changed in the Bulk edit template, the upload will fail.

1. To edit multiple subscribers at once, navigate to the Subscribers tab. In the ribbon at the top, click **Bulk Edit**.

2. Bulk edit uses an Excel template to make edits to subscriber information. In the Bulk Edit box, click **Export this excel** to download the current list of subscribers including all of their information.

   > ![Editing a License - Export Bulk Edits List](_img/edit-license/edit-license-bulk-edit-export.png)

3. Next, save the file locally so you can easily find it and make any necessary changes prior to uploading it. To ensure a successful upload, **don’t edit the subscription level or the subscription GUID** in the Bulk edit file as doing so will cause the upload to fail.

4. Return to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration portal and in the Bulk Edit dialog box, click **Browse**. Select the Excel file you saved and click **OK**. You will see the upload progress on the screen.

5. Once you’ve uploaded the file, you will see a notification letting you know it was successful. At this point, your edits will be reflected in the subscriber information.
