# Use the maximum usage feature to track the number of assigned subscriptions

A new feature in the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin portal helps you track how many subscriptions you purchased and assigned. It also identifies the peak number of subscriptions for each level that you assigned. You can sort information by the past year or throughout the duration of your agreements.

## Maximum usage overview

To learn how to use the maximum usage feature, watch the following video or read on.

## View your maximum usage

To see the peak number of subscriptions assigned for any agreement and subscription level:

1. Select the agreement that you want to view on the dropdown menu at the top left of the portal. (If you have only one agreement, it's automatically selected.)
2. Select the **maximum usage** icon (the third icon from the top on the left side of the subscriber grid).  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Maximum Usage Fly Out](_img/maximum-usage/maximum-usage-menu.png "Screenshot of the maximum usage dialog. The maximum usage button in the left pane is highlighted.")

3. A dialog that shows the 12-month maximum usage appears, and the maximum number of subscriptions you assigned within the past year for each level is displayed. You can also see the month in which you reached that peak.

## View your assignment history

In addition to seeing the peak assignments for each subscription level, you can see a running account of the activity on the agreement, including purchases and assignments. Select the **Export full report** button. (You might need to scroll down to see the button.)  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Maximum Usage Full Report](_img/maximum-usage/maximum-usage-full-report.png "Screenshot of the assignment history report.")

For each subscription level, the report shows the date you reached a new maximum assignment level and the number of subscriptions you had available as of that date. You can easily see any dates where you had overallocations.  

## Frequently asked questions

### How is the information in the maximum usage feature different from the assignment information available in the Overview section on the left side of the portal?

The information in the overview shows the *current* assignments and available subscriptions for each subscription level. This information might be different from the maximum number of subscriptions assigned for the agreement during the current year or the life of the agreement. The maximum usage feature allows you to see when the maximum assignment levels were reached and what the levels were. This distinction is important, because billing for subscriptions during true-up is based on the maximum number of subscriptions assigned at any point throughout the year.
