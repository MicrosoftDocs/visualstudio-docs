# The CAST Highlight benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions
Developers need critical insights on their software when migrating to the cloud. With CAST Highlight, Visual Studio subscribers can rapidly scan their application source code to identify the cloud readiness of their applications for migration to Azure and monitor progress of their app both during and after a migration.

- Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers can get a free, full feature three-month subscription to CAST Highlight that allows users to assess up to five apps.
- Visual Studio Professional subscribers can get a similar subscription that allows assessing of one app for three months.
