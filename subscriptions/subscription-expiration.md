# What happens when your subscription expires
Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations, and unless they are renewed, they will expire.  When a subscription expires, the benefits provided by the subscription are impacted in different ways.  This article will explain how expiration affects various aspects of a Visual Studio subscription. 

If you would like to purchase a new subscription, you can explore purchasing options on our [pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing).

## Downloads
The product downloads page, <https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads>, will still be available so you can download software, but you will not be able to claim new product keys.  Updates, patches, and other tools may still be available on the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads).  Products you have previously downloaded via your subscription are still valid.

## Product keys
The product keys page, <https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys>, is no longer available.  Any product keys you have previously claimed will still function as they normally would.  All installation limits remain unaffected.  To export your claimed product keys after your subscription expires, please visit <https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions> and click on the **Export all keys** button.  No new product keys may be claimed after your subscription expires.

## Benefits 
Not all benefits are impacted in the same way when a subscription expires.  No benefits may be activated after your subscription expires.  Benefits you have previously activated may still be available.  

### Visual Studio IDE
Most subscriptions provide perpetual licenses for the Visual Studio IDE. Download the Visual Studio [Licensing White Paper](https://aka.ms/vslicensing) to determine if your subscription is eligible for perpetual use rights.  If your subscription is eligible for perpetual use rights, you will continue to have access to your current version of the IDE but will not receive updates to future versions. To continue using the IDE after expiration, you will need to go to the [product key page](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) and download the product key **before your subscription expires**.

### Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps acquired through a Visual Studio subscription will be unavailable.  

### Azure credits
Monthly Azure credit allotments will continue for a limited time following expiration of your subscription.  Unused credits already applied to your Azure subscription in the current month will still be available for your use.  If you wish to continue using Azure resources from that subscription after your credits are exhausted, you can either [transfer those resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription or [convert your existing subscription to pay-as-you-go](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal).

### Other benefits 
Many of the benefits included in Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations.  Benefits provided by Microsoft's partners such as Pluralsight, DataCamp, or WhiteSource have time limits once they are activated.  Benefits you have previously activated will continue to be available to you for the remainder of their terms.  For example, if you have activated a six-month LinkedIn Learning subscription and it still has four months remaining when your Visual Studio subscription expires, you will still have four months of access to the LinkedIn Learning subscription.
