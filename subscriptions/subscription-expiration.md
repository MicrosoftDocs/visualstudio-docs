Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations and expire unless renewed. When a subscription expires, the benefits provided by the subscription are impacted in different ways. This article explains how expiration affects various aspects of a Visual Studio subscription. 

If you would like to purchase a new subscription, you can explore purchasing options on our [pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing).

## Downloads

The product downloads page (<https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads>) is still available for downloading software, but new product keys can no longer be claimed. Updates, patches, and other tools might still be available on the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads). Previously downloaded products via your subscription are still valid.

## Product keys

The product keys page (<https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys>) is no longer available. Any previously claimed keys still function as they normally would. All installation limits remain unaffected.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure that your product keys are available after your subscription expires, you need to export them before the expiration date of your subscription. To export your keys, connect to the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page and select the blue **Export all keys** button.  

## Benefits 

Not all benefits are impacted in the same way when a subscription expires. No benefits can be activated after your subscription expires. Previously activated benefits might still be available, depending on how they're authenticated. Most Microsoft Partner benefits, such as Pluralsight training, are still available for the duration of the benefit. Benefits that require validation that a Visual Studio subscription is still current, aren't available.

### Visual Studio IDE

Most subscriptions provide perpetual licenses for the Visual Studio IDE. Download the Visual Studio [Licensing White Paper](https://aka.ms/vslicensing) to determine if your subscription is eligible for perpetual use rights. If your subscription is eligible, you'll continue to have access to your **current version** of the IDE but won't receive updates to future versions. To continue using the IDE after expiration, go to the [product key page](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) and download the product key **before your subscription expires**. After claiming the key, [enter it](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-unlock-visual-studio#enter-a-product-key) to activate your IDE installation.  

### Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps acquired through a Visual Studio subscription is unavailable.  

### Azure credits

Monthly Azure credit allotments continue for a limited time following expiration of your subscription. Unused credits already applied to your Azure subscription in the current month are still available for your use. If you wish to continue using Azure resources from that subscription after your credits are exhausted, you can either [transfer those resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription or [convert your existing subscription to pay-as-you-go](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal).

### Other benefits

Many of the benefits included in Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations. Benefits provided by Microsoft's partners such as Pluralsight, DataCamp, or Cloud Academy have time limits after they're activated. Benefits activated previously are available to you for the remainder of the term. For example, if you've activated a six-month Pluralsight subscription and it still has four months remaining when your Visual Studio subscription expires, you can access it for those four months.
