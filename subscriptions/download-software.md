# Downloading software titles in Visual Studio subscriptions
Depending on which Visual Studio subscription you have, a wide variety of Microsoft software titles may be available to you.  This article will outline how to locate and download the software you need to get the most out of your subscription. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only the downloads included with your subscription are displayed for you on the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured) page.  If you have more than one subscription or program membership, the downloads shown will be for the **highest subscription** you hold, even if you are currently viewing a different subscription.  For example, if you have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription and a Visual Studio Professional subscription both associated with the same sign-in ID, the downloads shown will be those included in the Enterprise subscription, even if youâ€™re currently viewing your Professional subscription benefits.

> [!NOTE]
> We are aware of an issue regarding the availability of Office 365 product keys.  We are investigating the cause and will update this article when the issue is resolved. 

## How do I find downloads in the subscriber portal?
When you visit the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page, you'll see popular downloads arranged in groups by product type.  You can select one of the popular downloads shown, or search for any product using the search bar at the top of the page.

For example, if you choose **Visual Studio 2019** from the Developer Tools list, you'll see a list of available Visual Studio 2019 downloads.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual Studio 2019 downloads](_img/subscriber-downloads/vs2019-product-list.png)

You easily select your architecture, language and file type using the available drop-down menus. Choose your preferred options, and click **Download** to begin downloading the product.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all titles are available in all architectures, languages or file formats.  

### Displaying download details
Clicking on the product name or on the **Info** link will display the details for that download and provide access to the release notes for the product.

In the details pane, you can also click on the **Keys** tab to check the status of your product keys.

### Obtaining product keys
To obtain a product key for the download, you can either click the blue key labeled **Get Key** or if you're already viewing the details pane, click on **Claim key** on the **Keys** tab.
