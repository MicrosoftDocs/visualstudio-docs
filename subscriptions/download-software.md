# Downloading software titles in Visual Studio subscriptions
Depending on which Visual Studio subscription you have, a wide variety of Microsoft software titles may be available to you.  This article will outline how to locate and download the software you need to get the most out of your subscription. 

Only the downloads included with your subscription are displayed for you on the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured) page.  If you have more than one subscription or program membership, the downloads shown will be for the **highest subscription** you hold, even if you are currently viewing a different subscription.  For example, if you have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription and a Visual Studio Professional subscription both associated with the same sign-in ID, the downloads shown will be those included in the Enterprise subscription, even if you’re currently viewing your Professional subscription benefits.  

If your subscription is provided by your work or school, your subscriptions admin controls whether you have access to downloads. Disabling access to downloads also disables access to product keys. If you don't have access to downloads and product keys and need them, [contact your admin](contact-my-admin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> We are aware of an issue regarding the availability of Microsoft 365 product keys.  We are investigating the cause and will update this article when the issue is resolved. 

## How do I find downloads in the subscriber portal?
When you visit the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page, you'll see popular downloads arranged in groups by product type.  You can select one of the popular downloads shown, or search for any product using the search bar at the top of the page.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Subscriber downloads page](_img/subscriber-downloads/subscriber-downloads-resized.png "The most popular downloads are displayed when you select the Downloads blade.")

For example, if you choose **Visual Studio 2019** from the Developer Tools list, you'll see a list of available Visual Studio 2019 downloads.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual Studio 2019 downloads](_img/subscriber-downloads/vs2019-product-list.png "When you select a product, a list of available versions is displayed.")

You easily select your architecture, language and file type using the available drop-down menus. Choose your preferred options, and  select **Download** to begin downloading the product.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all titles are available in all architectures, languages or file formats.  

### Displaying download details
Selecting the product name or on the **Info** link will display the details for that download and provide access to the release notes for the product.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual Studio 2019 download details](_img/subscriber-downloads/vs2019-info.png "The Info tab displays information about the download and provides access to release notes.")

In the details pane, you can also select the **Keys** tab to check the status of your product keys.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual Studio 2019 product keys](_img/subscriber-downloads/vs2019-keys.png "The Keys tab shows you how many keys you have remaining and allows you to claim available keys.")

### Obtaining product keys
To obtain a product key for the download, you can either select the blue key labeled **Get Key** or if you're already viewing the details pane, select **Claim key** on the **Keys** tab.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Visual Studio 2019 claim product keys](_img/subscriber-downloads/vs2019-claim-keys.png "Select Claim Key to claim remaining keys.")
