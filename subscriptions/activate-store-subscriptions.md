# How do I activate a subscription acquired from the Microsoft Store?
If you've purchased a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, the activation steps can be initiated from the payment "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" you received after your purchase.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not received an email, please validate your email address and check your junk mail folders

## Activate your subscription
1. Click on **Click here to sign in** in the confirmation email or on the purchase confirmation page.
2. You will be redirected to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
3. Enter the email address that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription and click **Continue**.
4. You may be redirected to one of two different sign-in pages depending on the type of account you are using:
    - Subscribers using their personal "Microsoft Account" (MSA) will see the Microsoft Account password page.
    - Subscribers using their work/school accounts will be redirected to their organization's sign-in page.
5. Enter your password, or complete your organization's sign-in requirements.
6. Upon successful sign-in, an "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" window will appear.
7. Enter the product key information available from the payment "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" and click **Activate**.
8. The subscription should now be visible on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page and you should access to all your subscription benefits.

## Next steps
Visit the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page to see all the tools, services, training and support benefits included in your subscription.  We recommend setting up your [Visual Studio](vs-ide-benefit.md) and [Azure DevOps](vs-azure-devops.md) to get started.
