# Office 365 ProPlus in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Create your best work. Work anywhere with apps that are always updated.

The apps can be installed on multiple devices, including PCs, Macs, iPads, iPhones, Android tablets, and Android phones. With a subscription, you get the latest versions of the apps and automatically receive updates when they happen.
