# Windows Developer account in Visual Studio subscriptions

Your Windows Developer Account, included with selected Visual Studio subscription, lets you submit free and paid Windows apps to the Windows Store.

## Activation steps

To use your Windows Developer Account, you need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creation of a Windows Developer account requires the use of a Microsoft Account (MSA).  Use of Microsoft Entra accounts is not supported.  

We recommend that you create a "private" browser window for this process.  For example, in Google Chrome, create a new "incognito" window.  In Internet Explorer, create a new "InPrivate" window.

1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Locate the Windows Developer Account tile in the Tools section and select on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.  Copy the code to your clipboard, then select **Activate**.
