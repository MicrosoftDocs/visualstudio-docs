# Windows Developer account in Visual Studio subscriptions
Your Windows Developer Account, included with selected Visual Studio subscription, lets you submit free and paid Windows apps to the Windows Store.

## Activation steps
To use your Windows Developer Account, you’ll need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account.

We recommend that you create a "private" browser window for this process.  For example, in Google Chrome, create a new "incognito" window.  In Internet Explorer, create a new "InPrivate" window.

1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Locate the Windows Developer Account tile in the Tools section and click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.  Copy the code to your clipboard, then click **Activate**.

9. You may be asked to verify your password.  Enter it and click **Sign in**.
10. On the Registration – Payment page, paste the code you copied earlier into the Promo Code field.  The page will update to show that *no payment is required*.  Click **Next**.
