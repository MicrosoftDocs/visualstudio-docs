# Get assistance from your subscriptions admin

If your Visual Studio subscription is provided to you by your work or school, chances are it was assigned to you by a subscriptions administrator, or "admin".  Admins can assist with:
+ Assigning a subscription that meets your needs or removing one you no longer need
+ Changing the email address you use to sign in
+ Enabling access to software downloads
+ Other functions related to your subscription

Many organizations are large and complex, so you may not be aware of who your admin is.  We provide a feature in the subscriber portal to assist you with contacting your admin(s).   

## How to contact your admin

1. Sign in to the subscriber portal at <https://my.visualstudio.com>
2. Select the **Subscriptions** tab. 
3. Select the **Contact my Admin** button at the top right. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of the subscriptions page in the subscriber portal.  The Contact my admin button is highlighted.](_img/contact-my-admin/contact-my-admin-button.png "Screenshot of the subscriptions page in the subscriber portal.  The Contact my admin button is highlighted.")
4. Enter the message for your admin.
5. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, choose the **Send me a copy** checkbox. 
6. Finally, select **Send**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Super admins:**  To set the email address to which "Contact my Admin" requests are sent, specify that address in the [Agreement Preferences](admin-preferences.md#contact-email-address).
