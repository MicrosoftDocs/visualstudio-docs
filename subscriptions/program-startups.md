# Visual Studio subscriptions offered to startups
Qualified startups who join the Microsoft for Startups program can earn 5 [Visual Studio Enterprise monthly cloud subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/). These are the same subscriptions that are offered commercially, with no special limitations or restrictions. Each subscription must be assigned to an end user (who is the licensed user) before the user can run Visual Studio and be recognized as a Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber in Azure DevOps Services.

**Sign-in required with Visual Studio**
With all Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, the licensed user must sign in to Visual Studio using the same identity/login that was used to activate the Visual Studio subscription.

Product keys are not offered to unlock the product; sign-in is the only option for running Visual Studio. The Visual Studio subscriber can operate offline for up to 30 days before Visual Studio stops working. While working online, Visual Studio silently refreshes the user's license status periodically to ensure the subscription is still valid.
