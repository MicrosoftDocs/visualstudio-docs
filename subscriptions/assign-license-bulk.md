# Assign subscriptions to multiple users
The Subscriptions Administration Portal lets you add users one-at-a-time, or in large groups.  To add individual users, see [Add single users](assign-license.md).

To add large groups of users, you can use the bulk add feature, or if your organization is using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can use Azure AD groups. This article will explain the process for both options.

## Use Bulk add to assign subscriptions
1. Sign into the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal at <https://manage.visualstudio.com>.

1. To add multiple subscribers at one time, navigate to the **Manage Subscribers** tab. Choose the **Add** tab, then choose **Bulk add** in the drop-down.  

1. Bulk add uses a Microsoft Excel template to upload subscriber information. In the Upload Multiple Subscribers dialog box, click **Download** to download the template.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Download the Excel template to upload multiple subscribers](media/download-template-upload-subscribers.png)
   >
   > [!NOTE]
   > Always download the latest version of this template. If you use an older version, your bulk upload may fail.

1. In the Excel spreadsheet, fill out the fields with the information for the individuals that you want to assign subscriptions to. (*Reference* is an optional field.) Save the file locally after you're done.

    > [!NOTE]
    > One of the fields in the template allows admins to enable or disable subscribers' ability to download software.  Disabling downloads also disables their access to product keys.

   To help ensure a smooth upload, observe the following best practices:

    - Ensure that none of the form fields contain commas.
    - Remove spaces before and after form fields.
    - Make sure user's names do not contain extra spaces between two-part first or last names (for example, if a person has a two-part first name such as "Maggie May", it should be typed as "MaggieMay" because the system won't trim the extra space.)
    - Make sure all required fields are completed. 
    - Check the **Error message** column.  If any errors are listed, resolve those before attempting to upload the file. 

1. Return to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration portal. In the **Upload Multiple Subscribers** dialog box, click **Browse**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Browse to your saved template to upload multiple subscribers](media/bulk-add-browse-saved-template.png)

1. Navigate to the Excel file that you saved, and then click **OK**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Upload the Excel template to upload multiple subscribers](media/bulk-upload-subscribers.png)

    An upload progress dialog appears.

    If the template contains errors, the upload will fail, and you will be shown the errors so that you can correct the template and attempt the bulk upload again.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Error message if the upload of multiple subscribers fails](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-upload-failure.png)

   If you encounter a failure follow these steps:
   1. Open the Excel file you created, correct the problems, and save the file.
   0. Return to the Adminstration Portal and choose **Add**.
   0. Select **Bulk add**.
   0. Since you already have the Excel file saved, you do not need to download the template.  Click **Browse**, locate the file you just saved, and click **Open**.
   0. Click **OK**.


    When the upload is successful, you'll see the list of subscribers and a confirmation message.

## Use Azure Active Directory groups to assign subscriptions 
Using this feature makes it easy to stay on top of your subscription assignments. You can add Azure Active Directory Security Groups in the Subscriptions Administration Portal which will ensure that all individuals in the group are assigned a subscription. And to make it easier, when individuals leave your organization and are removed from Azure Active Directory, their access to subscriptions is also removed. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The following limitations apply to the use of Azure AD groups for adding subscribers:
> - The administrator must be a member of the AAD tenant when initially adding a group to the adminstration portal.  After the group has been added, changes to the membership of the groups does not require admin involvement. 
> - Groups must contain at least one member.  Empty groups are not supported.
> - Groups must have less than 1,000 users. 
> - All users must be in the top level of the group.  Nested groups are not supported.
> - Only trusted agreements are supported.
> - All members of the group must have an email address associated with their Azure AD account.
> - Separate email addresses for notifications are not supported for subscriptions added using Azure AD groups.

1. Sign in to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal at [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

2. To add multiple subscribers at one time, navigate to the **Manage subscribers** tab.

3. Choose the **Add** tab, then select **Azure Active Directory group** in the drop-down.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Choose bulk add using Azure AD](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-aad.png)

4. Begin to enter the name of the Azure AD group that you'd like to add into the form field. This will search the available Azure AD groups within your organization. 

5. When you select the group, the field will automatically populate with the group name. You will have the option to view the users in that group before you add them. Next, you can choose the subscription level, download rights, and communication preferences for the group. You can add details into the reference field if you wish. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Choose bulk add using Azure AD](_img/assign-license-bulk/bulk-add-aad-details.png)

6. Click **Add** and then **Confirm**. 

7. To see the added group, scroll to the bottom of your list of users.  

8. Select **View subscribers** to display the members of the group. You can view details about the subscribers in the group, but you cannot make any edits to the subscribers or the subscriptions that they are assigned.    

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already assigned subscriptions individually to users who are subsequently added as part of an Azure AD group, they will be added as part of the group and will no longer be listed individually. However, if the individual subscription is for a different subscription level, they will have two subscriptions.  Example:  If a user has an individual Visual Studio Professional subscription, and they are a member of a group to which you assign Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions, they will have both.  


## Frequently asked questions
### Q: Can I choose multiple subscription levels to be assigned within an Azure AD group? 
A: No -- everyone in the group receives the same subscription. 

### Q: Can I edit subscriber details of individuals added in an Azure AD group?  
A: No -- To modify information for an individual subscriber, you will need to remove them from the Azure AD security group and assign them a subscription individually.  

### Q: I added someone to my Azure AD security group, but I don't see them added in the Subscriptions Administration Portal, and they don't have a subscription. Why not?  
A: Depending on how your organization has configured Azure AD, you may see delays of up to 24 hours before the user is added. If it's been longer than 24 hours, [contact support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/support/support-overview-vs).
