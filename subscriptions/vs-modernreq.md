# The MODERNRequirements4TFS benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Selected Visual Studio subscriptions include a six month subscription for MODERNRequirements SmartOffice 4TFS and ModernRequirements4TFS.  MODERNRequirements SmartOffice4TFS extends the capabilities of TFS or Azure DevOps Services with Microsoft Word-based reporting, and quick, simplified rich text authoring.  ModernRequirements4TFS provides work item baselining and HTML5 simulation capabilities.

6. On the Download Page, you have the option to install the MODERNRequirements suites, or install individual modules from the SMARTOffice4TFS suite.  The right options for you will depend on your preferences, as well as which version of TFS you have installed.  Be sure to familiarize yourself with the information on the page to help you select the right version of the products for you.

7. For this example, we’ll choose SMARTOffice4TFS.  The download dialog will appear, providing three options for downloading and saving the .zip file.  We’ll choose **Save** so that we have a copy of the package in the Downloads folder of the PC.

8. When the download of **SmartOffice4TFS_Online.zip** has completed, click **Open folder**.

9. Open the “SmartOffice4TFS_Online” folder.

10. Open the “SmartOffice4TFS_Online” subfolder.
