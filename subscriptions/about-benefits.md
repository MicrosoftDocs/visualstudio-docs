# About your subscription benefits

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > **Get started:** View and activate your benefits in the **Subscriber portal** at https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits

## What's on this page

+ **How benefits differ** based on your subscription level and how they might change over time.  
+ **How to browse and filter benefits** by category to quickly find what applies to your subscription.  
+ **How partner-provided benefits work**, including variations in duration, support, and availability.

As a Visual Studio subscriber, the benefits available to you depend on your subscription level. Some benefits might change during your subscription as offers are added, updated, or retired.

+ Visual Studio Subscription benefits might change over time, including during the lifetime of an active subscription. We regularly review and update benefits to ensure they remain current and aligned with program goals and partner offerings. As a result, benefits might be added, updated, or discontinued. 

## Benefits vary based on your subscription 

The benefits included in your subscription depend on your subscription type. To see which benefits are available for different subscription levels, visit:  
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/. You can filter the view by subscription level or by benefit category.

Each benefit article in our learn documentation website includes an **Eligibility** section that identifies which subscription levels include that benefit.

## Use categories to help find benefits

Benefits are grouped into three categories: 
+ Tools
+ Professional Development
+ Support

When you visit <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>, all benefits appear by default. Use the category filter to narrow the list to the benefits you want to review.

## Benefits and offers provided by partners

Some benefits—such as training, tools, and services—are provided by partners. Details for these offers vary. For example:
+ The duration of the benefit might not match the duration of your Visual Studio subscription. You might have a 12-month Visual Studio subscription, while many of the partner-provided benefits might last for a shorter term, such as three or six months.
+ Any support available for those benefits or offers is also provided by the partners.
+ Some benefits renew when your Visual Studio subscription is renewed. In other cases, the partner offer is "once in a lifetime" and doesn't renew. 
For more information about individual benefits, check out the corresponding article in the table of contents.
+ Partner-provided benefits are offered and fulfilled at the discretion of the partner. A claim or attempted redemption by a subscriber doesn't guarantee fulfillment; if the partner discontinues or can't provide the benefit, it might not be delivered. 

For more information on each benefit, see the corresponding article in the table of contents.

## Benefits that become temporarily unavailable

In rare cases, a benefit might become temporarily unavailable due to technical issues. When such issues happen, the benefit tile in the [Visual Studio subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) displays **"Temporarily Unavailable"**. The benefit is restored once the issue is resolved.
