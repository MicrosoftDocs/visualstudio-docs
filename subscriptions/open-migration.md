# Partners managing subscriptions on behalf of customers
To manage subscriptions in the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), there are a few steps they will need to follow. The process will be:
- Partners will place a new order on behalf of a customer, entering the customer’s business email address.
- The customer will receive a notification inviting them to assign administrators and access their subscriptions in the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
- For partners to manage subscriptions on behalf of customers, they will need to register on the administration portal. The various ways to access gain access are listed below (similar to the add-open process).

## Existing partners adding a new license
This applies to partners that already have access to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), but have placed an order for Open Licenses with Visual Studio subscriptions that they will need to manage.  Steps for partners to add a new license:
- Sign in to https://manage.visualstudio.com.
- Select the agreement dropdown and scroll to the bottom where there is an option to **+New open license**.
- In the pop-out panel, enter the authorization number, license number, customer email address that is on the agreement, select the checkbox, and then click **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.

## New partners who register on the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)
This applies to new partners placing new Open License orders, but who register on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) through the add-open flow prior to attempting to access the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Partners should follow these steps:
- Sign in to VLSC and navigate to the "Relationship Summary".
- Select the desired Open License.
- Next, in the "License Details" under “Visual Studio Subscriptions” select the option to manage subscriptions through the link **click here**.
- Sign in to the new manage portal using the same email address previously used to sign in to VLSC.
- The Partner will then be able to manage subscriptions for that Open License.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.


## New partners visiting the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal directly
This scenario applies to new partners, who have already placed new Open License orders, but who haven’t registered on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) and go directly to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).  Follow these steps:
- Visit https://manage.visualstudio.com.
- You receive an error that you are not a recognized user.
- Select the **OLP Partners** registration option and enter the authorization number, license number, customer email address used on the order, select the checkbox, and click **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.
