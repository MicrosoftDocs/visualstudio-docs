# Partners managing subscriptions on behalf of customers

To manage subscriptions in the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), there are a few steps that partners need to follow. 

After a partner places a new order on behalf of a customer, the customer will receive a notification inviting them to assign admins and access their subscriptions in the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
+ For partners to manage subscriptions on behalf of customers, they need to register on the admin portal. This article discusses the various ways to gain access  (similar to the add-open process).

## New partners visiting the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal directly

This scenario applies to new partners who placed new Open License orders, but who aren't registered on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) and go directly to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Follow these steps:
1. Visit <https://manage.visualstudio.com>.
1. You receive a notification that you're not a recognized user.
1. Select the **OLP Partners** registration option.
1. Enter the authorization number, license number, customer email address used on the order. 
1. Check the box, indicating your acknowledgment regarding the permissions listed.
1. Select **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.

## New partners who register on the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)

This scenario applies to new partners placing new Open License orders but who register on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) through the add-open flow before attempting to access the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Partners should follow these steps:
1. Sign in to VLSC and navigate to the **Relationship Summary**.
1. Select the desired Open License.
1. Next, in the **License Details** under **Visual Studio Subscriptions** select the option to manage subscriptions through the link **click here**.
1. Sign in to the admin portal using the same email address listed as a Primary Contact.
1. The Partner is able to manage subscriptions for that Open License.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.

## Existing partners adding a new license

This scenario applies to partners that have access to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), but placed an order for Open Licenses with Visual Studio subscriptions that they need to manage.
