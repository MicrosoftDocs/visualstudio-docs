# Open and Open License migration to the new Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal

## Overview

In July 2018, all Open License customers will be migrated to the new [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com). This process, while slightly different than the onboarding process for the Enterprise and Select/Select Plus customers, is simple.

- Open License subscriptions will be migrated to the new portal.

- Current Subscriptions Administrators in the Volume License Service Center (VLSC) who are managing Open Licenses will receive an email inviting them to sign in to the new portal using the email address provided in that email.

- After they sign in, they will have access to their company’s subscriptions.

After the migration date, both customers and Partners will fall into one of the scenarios listed below.

## Open and Open License management for new orders

To manage subscriptions in the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), there are a few steps that Partners and customers will need to follow. The process will be:

- Partners will place a new order on behalf of a customer, entering the customer’s business email address.

- The customer will receive a notification inviting them to assign administrators and access their subscriptions in the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

- For Partners to manage subscriptions on behalf of customers, they will need to register on the administration portal. The various ways to access gain access are listed below (similar to the add-open process).

## Existing Partners adding a new license

This applies to Partners that already have access to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), but have placed an order for Open Licenses with Visual Studio subscriptions that they will need to manage.

- The Partner goes directly to https://manage.visualstudio.com and signs in.

- They will select the agreement dropdown and scroll to the bottom where there is an option to **+New Open License**.

- In the pop-out panel, the Partner will enter the authorization number, license number, customer email address that is on the agreement, select the checkbox, and then click **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.

## New Partners who register on the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)

This applies to new Partners placing new Open License orders, but who register on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) through the add-open flow prior to attempting to access the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

- The Partner will sign in to VLSC and navigate to the "Relationship Summary".

- They will then select the Open License they wish to manage.

- Next, in the "License Details" under “Visual Studio Subscriptions” they’ll select the option to manage subscriptions through the link **click here**.

- This will redirect the Partner to sign in to the new manage portal where they’ll need to use the same email address previously used to sign in to VLSC.

- The Partner will then be able to manage subscriptions for that Open License.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.

## New Partners visiting the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal  directly

This scenario applies to new Partners, who have already placed new Open License orders, but who haven’t registered on the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) and go directly to the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

- The Partner goes directly to https://manage.visualstudio.com.

- They receive an error that they are not a recognized user.

- The Partner will need to select the **OLP Partners** registration option and enter the authorization number, license number, customer email address used on the order, select the checkbox, and click **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> The customer will receive a notification email informing them that a Partner has been added to the Open License. They can choose to remove the Partner’s access.
