# Visual Studio subscriptions are available through Volume Licensing

Visual Studio subscriptions are available through various channels. Choose from Volume Licensing, Cloud Solution Providers, the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), and [Microsoft Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/buy-activate-retail). This article explores purchasing and activating subscriptions through [Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default).

## How to buy subscriptions

Need help with deciding which subscription is right for you? Check out our [subscription benefits page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/).  

Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Volume Licensing include:
+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [MSDN Platforms](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/msdn-platforms/)

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing, which reflects a significant discount, is only available for existing subscriptions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To qualify to renew subscriptions at the discounted renewal price, subscriptions should be renewed before they expire. Subscriptions expired for 30 days or more are not eligible for renewal pricing.
