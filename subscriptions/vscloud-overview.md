[Compare cloud subscription benefits and pricing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio Professional Annual subscriptions and Visual Studio Enterprise Annual subscriptions in Cloud Subscriptions. There's no change to existing customers experience and ability to renew, increase, decrease, or cancel their subscriptions. New customers are encouraged to go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) to explore different options to purchase Visual Studio. You can still purchase new monthly cloud subscriptions.

## Before you start

To bill your purchases, you need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/). You can [sign up](https://portal.azure.com) before your first purchase or during your first purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Who can buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions?

You need to be a contributor or higher for an Azure subscription that was created for your EA subscription to purchase cloud subscriptions.

## How to buy cloud subscriptions

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Marketplace > Subscriptions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

2. Choose the subscription that you want to buy, for example - Visual Studio Professional - monthly subscription.

3. Select the Azure subscription to use for billing. You can create a new Azure subscription if you don't have one.

   If you don't want subscriptions assigned to yourself, clear **Assign this subscription to me**.

## Frequently asked questions

This section discusses questions related to the fact that Microsoft is no longer offering annual cloud subscriptions. 

### For new customers:

#### Q: I was considering the Annual Cloud subscription, and now I can’t find it. What should I do?

A: Microsoft is no longer offering annual cloud subscriptions. Go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) for other purchasing options.

#### Q: What purchasing options are available to me?

A: We provide monthly subscriptions and standard subscriptions in our direct sales channels. For more information, check out [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).
There are also many options through our volume licensing program. You can research the options and prices on
[https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy).

#### Q: The price for a retail subscription is higher. What extra benefits am I receiving?

A: You receive perpetual license rights for the Visual Studio IDE that came with the subscription. When it's time to renew, you only pay the software assurance price, which is lower.

### For existing annual cloud subscribers

#### Q: How does the end of annual cloud subscription sales affect me?

A: This change doesn't affect existing subscribers.

#### Q: Do I need to do anything as a result of these changes?

A: No. Your subscriptions remain in place and you're able to manage them as you do today.

#### Q: What if I want to increase the number of subscriptions for my customers?

A: Annual subscriptions that are purchased during a given month are charged immediately for a full year and are valid for a full year. So, you can modify the number of licenses only in the current month of purchase (they're valid for one year and charged for one year). Outside of the month of purchase, it's no longer possible to increase the number of subscriptions.

#### Q: What if I want to decrease the number of subscriptions for my customers?

A: Your admin can still decrease the number of subscriptions by visiting https://manage.visualstudio.com and following the instructions in this article to decrease subscription counts. The system *doesn't* generate a prorated credit. To request a refund, contact the Azure billing team.

#### Q: If I cancel my subscription, can I buy another Annual Cloud subscription later?

A: Although you aren't able to buy another Cloud Annual subscription, there are many options to purchase Visual Studio Subscriptions. Learn more at [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).

### For Cloud Solution Providers (CSP)

#### Q: How does this change affect my customers?

A: Your customers aren't able to purchase new Visual Studio Cloud Annual subscriptions.

#### Q: Do my customers need to do anything because of these changes?

A: Existing customers aren't impacted. New customers need to decide whether they want to purchase Visual Studio Monthly subscriptions or go to another channel such as volume licensing to purchase Visual Studio Subscriptions.

#### Q: What if I want to increase the number of subscriptions for my customers?

A: Annual subscriptions purchased during a given month are charged immediately for a full year and are valid for a full year. For that reason, your admin can only modify the number of licenses in the current month of purchase (they're valid for one year and charged for one year). Outside of the month of purchase it's no longer possible to increase the number of subscriptions.

#### Q: What if I want to decrease the number of subscriptions for my customers?

A: Your admin can still decrease the number of subscriptions by visiting [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com) and following the instructions in this article to decrease subscription counts.
