# Buy Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise cloud subscriptions
You can buy [Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). These are called **"cloud subscriptions"**.

[Compare cloud subscription benefits and pricing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio Professional Annual subscriptions and Visual Studio Enterprise Annual subscriptions in Cloud Subscriptions. There will be no change to existing customers experience and ability to renew, increase, decrease, or cancel their subscriptions. New customers are encouraged to go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) to explore different options to purchase Visual Studio. You can still purchase new monthly cloud subscriptions.

## Before you start
To bill your purchases, you need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/). You can [sign up](https://portal.azure.com) before your first purchase or during your first purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Who can buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions?
Anyone with [owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [service admin or co-admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#assign-a-subscription-administrator) access to the Azure subscription can purchase cloud subscriptions.

## How to buy cloud subscriptions

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Marketplace > Subscriptions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

2. Choose the subscription that you want to buy, for example - Visual Studio Professional - monthly subscription.

3. Select the Azure subscription to use for billing. You can create a new Azure subscription if you don't have one.

    If you don't want subscriptions assigned to yourself, clear **Assign this subscription to me**.

5. Confirm and finish your purchase. If you assigned a subscription to yourself, you can visit the [Visual Studio subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com)
to start downloading software and using other subscriber benefits.

### For new customers:
#### Q:  I was considering the Annual Cloud subscription, and now I can’t find it.  What should I do?
A: Please go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) for other purchasing options.

#### Q: What purchasing options are available to me?
A:  We provide monthly subscriptions and standard subscriptions in our direct sales channels. For more information, check out [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).

[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy).

#### Q: The price for a retail subscription is higher. What additional benefits am I receiving?

### For existing annual cloud subscribers
#### Q:  How will this change impact me?
A:  This change will not impact existing subscribers.

#### Q:  Do I need to do anything as a result of these changes?
