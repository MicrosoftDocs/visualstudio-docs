[Compare cloud subscription benefits and pricing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio Professional Annual subscriptions and Visual Studio Enterprise Annual subscriptions in Cloud Subscriptions. There will be no change to existing customers experience and ability to renew, increase, decrease, or cancel their subscriptions. New customers are encouraged to go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) to explore different options to purchase Visual Studio. You can still purchase new monthly cloud subscriptions.

## Before you start
To bill your purchases, you need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/). You can [sign up](https://portal.azure.com) before your first purchase or during your first purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Who can buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions?
You'll need to be a contributor or higher for an Azure subscription that was created for your EA subscription to purchase cloud subscriptions.

## How to buy cloud subscriptions

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Marketplace > Subscriptions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

2. Choose the subscription that you want to buy, for example - Visual Studio Professional - monthly subscription.

3. Select the Azure subscription to use for billing. You can create a new Azure subscription if you don't have one.

    > ![Select Azure subscription for billing](_img/buy-vs-subscriptions/buy-vs-sub-Azure-sub.png "Select the Azure subscription to use to purchase your subscriptions.")

4. Select the number of subscriptions to buy.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select number of subscriptions](_img/buy-vs-subscriptions/buy-vs-sub-users.png "Choose the number of subscriptions to buy")

    If you don't want subscriptions assigned to yourself, clear **Assign this subscription to me**.

5. Confirm and finish your purchase. If you assigned a subscription to yourself, you can visit the [Visual Studio subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com)
to start downloading software and using other subscriber benefits.

If you purchased more than one subscription, proceed to the
    [Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) to assign subscriptions to others.  You may need to [add your new subscriptions](add-monthly-subs.md) to the Admin Portal if this is the first time you've purchased them.

## Frequently asked questions

### For new customers:
#### Q:  I was considering the Annual Cloud subscription, and now I can’t find it.  What should I do?
A: Please go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) for other purchasing options.

#### Q: What purchasing options are available to me?
A:  We provide monthly subscriptions and standard subscriptions in our direct sales channels. For more information, check out [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).
There are also many options through our volume licensing program. You can research the options and prices on
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy).

#### Q: The price for a retail subscription is higher. What additional benefits am I receiving?
A:  You will receive perpetual license rights for the Visual Studio IDE that came with the subscription. When it is time to renew, you only pay the software assurance price, which is significantly less.

### For existing annual cloud subscribers
#### Q:  How will this change impact me?
A:  This change will not impact existing subscribers.

#### Q:  Do I need to do anything as a result of these changes?
A:  No.  Your subscriptions will remain in place and you will be able to manage them as you do today.

A: Annual subscriptions that are purchased during a given month are charged immediately for a full year and are valid for a full year.
