# Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) benefits for Visual Studio subscribers

As an active Visual Studio subscriber, you can use a range of features in VSTS that are included with your subscription as a benefit. You'll be able to use these same features in each VSTS 
account in which you are a member--whether you created the account or were added by someone else. 

When you sign in to VSTS using either the identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription or your [alternate identity](vs-alternate-identity.md), 
we recognize this automatically. 

[Sign up for a free VSTS account](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)
