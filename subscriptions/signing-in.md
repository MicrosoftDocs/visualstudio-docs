# Signing in to your Visual Studio subscription

The steps to sign in to your Visual Studio subscription depend on the kind of account you're using.  For example, you may be using a Microsoft Account (MSA) or an email address supplied by your employer or school.

Three different sign-in methods are covered in this article:
1. Signing in with your Microsoft Account (MSA)
2. [Signing in with your work/school account](#signing-in-with-your-work-or-school-account)
3. [Using a Microsoft Account to sign in to a work/school account](#using-your-microsoft-account-to-sign-in-to-a-work-or-school-account)

## Signing in with your Microsoft Account (MSA)
1. Please visit [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Enter the email address you provided when you set up or purchased your Visual Studio subscription.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This address is also identified in the subscriber welcome email you received when you purchased the subscription or signed up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials. Please check your junk mail folders if you have trouble locating the welcome email.

3. Enter your password.
4. Click **Sign in**.
5. At this point, the "Benefits" page should be displayed.

### For Visual Studio Dev Essentials users:
When you access your Visual Studio Dev Essentials subscription for the first time, you will see a welcome dialog.  Click **Confirm** to accept the program's terms and conditions.

## Signing in with your work or school account
1. Please visit [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Enter the email address to which the new Visual Studio subscription was assigned.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This address is also identified in the subscriber welcome email you received. Please check your junk mail folders if you have trouble locating the welcome email.

3. Click **Continue**.
4. You will be redirected to your corporate sign-in page.
5. Enter your password.
6. Click **Sign in**
7. At this point, the "Benefits" page should be displayed

You can now see the type of subscription you're using displayed in the blue bar across the top of the portal.

You can also see your currently selected subscription in the upper right corner, under your username.  It will say "Showing: ", followed by the subscription.  If you have more than one subscription, you can click on the drop down arrow and select the subscription you would like to use.

## Using your Microsoft Account to sign in to a work or school account

1. Go to [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Enter the email address that was assigned the new Visual Studio subscription

   > [!NOTE]
   > This address is also identified in the subscriber Welcome Letter. Please check your junk mail folders if the Welcome Letter was not received

3. Click **Continue**.
4. You'll be redirected to a decision page.
    - Select **Work or school account** if the subscription is associated with a "Work or School" account associated with an Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant.
    - Select **Personal** if the subscription is associated with a "Corporate" email address, but has also been converted to a "Personal" Microsoft Account (MSA).

        > [!NOTE]
        > This will be the case for many subscribers who have used Visual Studio subscriptions (formerly MSDN) in the past.

    - If one pathway fails, try the other.  Subscription administrators may have modified your subscription.

5. Enter your password.
6. Click **Sign in**.
7. At this point, the "Benefits" page should be displayed.
