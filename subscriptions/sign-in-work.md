# Signing in to Visual Studio subscription with your work or school account 

The steps to sign in to your Visual Studio subscription depend on the kind of account you're using. For example, you might be using a Microsoft Account (MSA) or an email address supplied by your employer or school. As of January 2019, you can now also use your GitHub account to sign in to some subscriptions. 

This article provides the steps for signing in with an email address provided by your work or school.

## Signing in with your work or school account

1. Visit [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Enter the email address to which the new Visual Studio subscription was assigned.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This address is also identified in the subscriber welcome email you received. Check your junk mail folders if you have trouble locating the welcome email.

3. Select **Continue**.
4. You're redirected to your corporate sign-in page.
5. Enter your password.
6. Select **Sign in**.
7. At this point, the "Benefits" page should be displayed.

You can now see the type of subscription you're using displayed in the blue bar across the top of the portal.

You can also see your currently selected subscription in the upper right corner, under your username. It says "Showing:" followed by the subscription. If you have more than one subscription, you can select on the drop-down arrow and select the subscription you would like to use.

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) don't support [GCC High tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod), also known as private or government domains. This also applies to subscribers attempting to sign into the Visual Studio IDE. To access Visual Studio subscriptions, your organization needs to have a public tenant. For further assistance in creating a public tenant, contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/). 

## Using your Microsoft Account (MSA) to sign in to a work or school account

1. Go to [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Enter the email address that was assigned to the new Visual Studio subscription.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This address also appears in the subscriber Welcome Letter. Check your junk mail folder if you donâ€™t receive the Welcome Letter.

3. Select **Continue**.
4. Enter your password.
5. Select **Sign in**.
6. At this point, the "Benefits" page should be displayed.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: I'm unable to sign in using my work or school email address. 

A: The most common cause of sign-in problems is attempting to sign in with an account that's different from the one associated with the subscription. If you use several different email addresses, it's possible that you're trying to sign in with the wrong one. Try signing in using another address. If that's unsuccessful, you can reach out to our [subscriptions support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/) team for assistance. 

### Q: I can't see my subscription. Where is it?

A: Many users have more than one subscription. If you're able to sign in to the Visual Studio subscriptions portal at https://my.visualstudio.com but can't see your subscription, there are two common causes:
+ You're logged in with a different Microsoft Account. It's possible that you have multiple subscriptions, such as a Professional or Enterprise subscription and a Visual Studio Dev Essentials membership that uses different email addresses. To see the other subscriptions, sign out and sign back in using the other MSA.
+ You have multiple subscriptions associated with the same email address. To see all the subscriptions associated with your email address, visit https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions and choose the subscription you wish to use.
