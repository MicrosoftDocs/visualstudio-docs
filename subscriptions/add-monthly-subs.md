# Add new monthly Visual Studio subscriptions to the Subscriptions Administration Portal
When you purchase new monthly Visual Studio subscriptions using an Azure subscription, you may need to add them to the Subscriptions Administration Portal in order to assign them to users.  

## How do I know if I need to add my subscriptions?
The steps to add monthly subscriptions depend on what kinds of subscriptions your organization already has, and whether you're a new admin.
- If you're a new admin, we'll check for Azure subscriptions on which you have User Access Administrator rights when you sign in to the Subscriptions Administration Portal the first time.  If we find monthly subscriptions for you, we'll add them automatically. 
- If you have previously added or administered monthly subscriptions, we check for new monthly subscriptions each time you sign in. 
- If you are already an admin for subscriptions acquired through Volume Licensing but haven't previously added or managed monthly subscriptions, you will need to add them using the steps provided below.

## How to add monthly subscriptions
1. Sign in to the Subscriptions Administration Portal at <https://manage.visualstudio.com>
1. On the **Manage subscribers** tab, choose the **Add agreement** drop-down 
1. Choose **New monthly subscriptions** in the drop-down
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add new monthly subscriptions drop-down](_img/add-monthly-subs/add-subs-drop-down.png "Choose 'Add agreement', then 'New monthly subscriptions.")
1. The system will search for any Azure subscriptions on which you have User Access Administrator rights, and will import any Visual Studio subscriptions purchased with those Azure subscriptions.
1. If no Azure subscriptions on which you have User Access Administrator rights are found, or qualifying Azure subscriptions are found but no Visual Studio subscriptions are found, you will receive the following message:
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![No new monthly subscriptions found](_img/add-monthly-subs/no-subs-found.png "Error message indicating that there are no Azure subscription or Visual Studio subscriptions are available to you.")
1. If new monthly subscriptions are found, you will receive a confirmation message
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Subscriptions added confirmation message](_img/add-monthly-subs/subs-added-confirmation.png "A confirmation message will display the subscriptions you've added.")

## Things to keep in mind
- The option to add new monthly subscriptions will only be available the first time you purchase them.  Once you've added monthly subscriptions, we will check for new subscriptions each time you sign in to the portal. 
- When new subscriptions are found, you may see that they are already assigned to subscribers.  That's because there are other admins with access to the Azure subscription, and they have already assigned the new Visual Studio subscriptions to users.  Now that you have also added them to your portal, you can administer those subscriptions. 

## Support resources
- For assistance with administration of Visual Studio Subscriptions, contact [Visual Studio subscriptions support](https://aka.ms/vsadminhelp).

## Next steps
Now that you've added subscriptions, you're ready to assign them to users.  You can do that in several ways:
- [Assign subscriptions individually](assign-license.md)
- [Assign subscriptions to multiple users](assign-license-bulk.md)
- [Assign specific subscriptions to specific users](assign-guid.md)
