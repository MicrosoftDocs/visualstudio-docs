# Visual Studio subscriptions are available through the Microsoft Store
Visual Studio subscriptions are available through a variety of channels, including [Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default), Cloud Solution Providers, the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), and Microsoft Store.  This article will explore purchasing and activating subscriptions through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/visualstudio).  

## How to buy subscriptions
Need help deciding which subscription is right for you?  Check out our [subscription benefits page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/).  

Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include:
- [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
- [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
- [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

Each of these subscription offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription.  Renewal pricing, which reflects a significant discount, is only available for existing subscriptions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To qualify to renew subscriptions at the discounted renewal price, subscriptions should be renewed before they expire.  

## How to activate subscriptions
After you purchase a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you can begin the activation process from the payment "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" you received after your purchase.

1. Click on **Click here to sign in** in the confirmation email or on the purchase confirmation page.
2. You will be redirected to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
3. Enter the email address that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription and click **Continue**.
4. You may be redirected to one of two different sign-in pages depending on the type of account you are using:
    - Subscribers using their personal "Microsoft Account" (MSA) will see the Microsoft Account password page.
    - Subscribers using their work/school accounts will be redirected to their organization's sign-in page.
5. Enter your password, or complete your organization's sign-in requirements.
6. Upon successful sign-in, an "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" window will appear.
7. Enter the product key information available from the payment "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" and click **Activate**.
8. The subscription should now be visible on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page and you should have access to all your subscription benefits.
