# Visual Studio subscriptions are available through the Microsoft Store

Visual Studio subscriptions are available through various channels. Choose from [Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default), Cloud Solution Providers, the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), and Microsoft Store. This article explores purchasing and activating subscriptions through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/visualstudio).  

## How to buy subscriptions

Need help with deciding which subscription is right for you? Check out our [subscription benefits page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/).  

Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include:
+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing, which reflects a significant discount, is only available for existing subscriptions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To qualify to renew subscriptions at the discounted renewal price, subscriptions should be renewed before they expire. Subscriptions expired for 30 days or more aren't eligible for renewal pricing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't receive your confirmation email or product key, contact the [Microsoft Store Support](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/help-with-microsoft-store-purchases-4f615f2a-6bbd-fd69-6695-ae213d63eef0). They can provide you with the necessary information so you can activate your renewal.   

## How to activate subscriptions

After you purchase a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you can begin the activation process from the payment confirmation page or confirmation email you received after your purchase.

1. Select the **Click here to sign in** link in the confirmation email or on the purchase confirmation page.
2. You're redirected to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
3. Enter the email address that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription and select **Continue**.
4. You might be redirected to one of two different sign-in pages depending on the type of account you're using:
    - Subscribers using their personal "Microsoft Account" (MSA) see the Microsoft Account password page.
    - Subscribers using their work/school accounts are redirected to their organization's sign-in page.
5. Enter your password, or complete your organization's sign-in requirements.
6. Upon successful sign-in, an "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" window appears.
7. Enter the product key information available from the payment "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" and select **Activate**.
8. The subscription should now be visible on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page and you should have access to all your subscription benefits.

>These subscriptions are activated using a product key and are intended for individual developers and small teams. As such, they don't include access to subscription management features such as user assignment, or renewal automation. These capabilities are only available for subscriptions provisioned through organizational licensing programs.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: How do I assign retail Visual Studio subscriptions to individual developers?

A: Each retail Visual Studio subscription includes a unique 5x5 product key, which the purchaser receives via email. While there isn't a typical "assignment" process available, this option should help with provisioning the intended user with access:

1. The purchaser shares one Visual Studio 5x5 product key with each developer.
1. The developer signs in to https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate. 
1. The developer enters their email address that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription and selects **Continue**.
1. They might be redirected to one of two different sign-in pages depending on the type of account they're using:
    + Subscribers using their personal "Microsoft Account" (MSA) see the Microsoft Account password page.
    + Subscribers using their work/school accounts are redirected to their organization's sign-in page.
1. They enter their password or complete the organization's sign-in requirements.
1. Upon successful sign-in, an "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscriptions" window appears.
1. They enter the 5x5 product key supplied to them from the "Confirmation Page" or "Confirmation Email" and select **Activate**.
1. The subscription should now be visible on their subscriptions page, and they should have access to all their subscription benefits.
