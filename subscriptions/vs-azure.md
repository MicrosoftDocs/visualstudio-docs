# Use Microsoft Azure in Visual Studio subscriptions
As a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use Microsoft Azure at no extra charge.  With your [monthly Azure DevTest individual credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/), Azure is your personal sandbox for dev/test.  You can provision virtual machines, cloud services, and other Azure resources.  Credit amounts vary by subscription level.

2. Locate the Azure tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page and click **Activate** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.

## Frequently asked questions
### Q: How do I submit a technical support incident from within the Azure portal?
A:  Submitting a support incident from the Azure portal is a three-step process.
1. Activate your technical support benefit, and obtain your Contract ID Access ID.
2. Link your support contract to your Azure subscription.
3. Submit a support incident.

Please visit the [Technical support](vs-tech-support.md) documentation for complete details.

### Q: How owns the intellectual property I create using my Azure DevTest individual credit?
A:  Intellectual property produced by an employee created on resources provided by that company is thereby intellectual property of the company providing the resource. So, if you received your Visual Studio subscription through your employer, their intellectual property policies would apply. 

### Q: I’ve received a message stating that my access to Azure will end soon.  What can I do to continue using Azure?
A:  You’re receiving this email because you use the Azure benefit associated with your Visual Studio subscription, and that subscription has expired or been removed.  To continue to use Azure, you have several options:

**Recommended action:**

To continue using your Visual Studio Azure DevTest individual credit and discounts, take one of the following steps:

If someone in your team or organization purchases subscriptions on your behalf, contact your organization’s Visual Studio administrator and request a Visual Studio subscription that entitles you to the Azure DevTest individual credit amount you need.   Please request the administrator to assign the new subscription to the same user ID that your previous subscription was assigned to, so that you don’t have to worry about transferring your Azure subscription.

If you can purchase a subscription directly, please do one of the following:
1. Purchase an annual Visual Studio [Enterprise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-annual) or [Professional](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-annual) cloud subscription through the Visual Studio Marketplace.
2. Take advantage of a 50% or higher discount by renewing your current subscription through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/result.aspx?q=visual+studio+subscription).

Compare all the [subscriptions and their benefits](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/).

If you have another active Visual Studio subscription at the **same** subscription level under a Microsoft account, you can link it to this Azure benefit by adding an [alternate account](manage-vs-subscriptions.md#linking-my-subscription-to-existing-azure-devops-services-or-azure-subscriptions) in the Visual Studio subscription portal. If this doesn’t work, you can also try [transferring your Azure benefit](/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer/) to the active Visual Studio subscription.

If you have another active Visual Studio subscription at a **different** subscription level and under a Microsoft account, contact [Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for assistance.

If your subscription has a spending limit and you take no action before it expires, the Azure subscription(s) your Azure subscription will be disabled. To convert it to a pay-as-you-go offer and continue to use it, add a payment instrument and [remove your spending limit](/azure/billing/billing-spending-limit/).

If you prefer not to continue this Visual Studio Azure subscription, you may transfer your resources such as virtual machines and databases to another Azure subscription and [cancel](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/cancel-account/) this subscription any time.

If you believe you’ve received this email in error, please contact [Azure customer support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).
