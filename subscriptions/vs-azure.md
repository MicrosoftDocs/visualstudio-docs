# Use Microsoft Azure in Visual Studio subscriptions
As a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use Microsoft Azure at no extra charge.  With your [monthly Azure DevTest individual credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/), Azure is your personal sandbox for dev/test.  You can provision virtual machines, cloud services, and other Azure resources.  Credit amounts vary by subscription level.

## Activation steps
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2. Locate the Azure tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page and click **Activate** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.

   > ![Azure Tile](_img/vs-azure/vs-azure-tile.png)

3. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you'll be asked to fill in the required information to create your Azure subscription.  The first step is to provide your personal information and then click **Next**.

4. Next, you'll need to verify your identity using a simple verification code. Provide your phone number, and choose whether you'd like to receive the code by text or phone.  Enter the code you receive, and click **Verify code**.

0. Bookmark the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) for easy access in the future.

## Maintain a subscription to use monthly credits
If your Visual Studio subscription expires or is removed, all the subscription benefits, including the monthly Azure dev/test individual credit are no longer available. To continue using Azure with a monthly credit, you will need to renew your subscription, purchase a new subscription, or transfer the Azure benefit to an active subscription that includes the Azure dev/test individual credit.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must transfer your resources to another Azure subscription before your current Azure subscription is disabled or you will lose access to your data.  

There are several ways to continue using a monthly credit for Azure.  To save your Azure resources, you will need to [transfer your resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription, regardless of the action you choose below. 

- **If you purchase your Visual Studio subscription directly**, purchase a new subscription or renew your subscription through Microsoft Store.  
    - [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
    - [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
    - [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
- **If someone in your organization purchases subscriptions for your organization**, [contact your Visual Studio subscription administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) and request a subscription that provides the monthly credit that you need.  
- **If you have another active Visual Studio subscription** at the same subscription level that’s associated with another Microsoft account, you may transfer the Azure benefit to another active Visual Studio subscription by [adding an alternate account](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/manage-vs-subscriptions#managing-my-profile) in the Visual Studio [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).  

Use the Eligibility table below to determine how many credits are included with each subscription type.  


## Convert your Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go

If you no longer need a Visual Studio subscription or credit but you want to continue using your Azure resources, [transfer your resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription, or convert your Azure subscription to pay-as-you-go pricing by [removing your spending limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal). 

If you don’t take one of these actions, your Azure subscription will be disabled and deleted 30 days after receiving the email notification.  

## Have a question?
If you have questions about transferring resources, removing spending limits, or other Azure topics, you can [submit an Azure support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) in the Azure portal.

## Frequently asked questions
### Q: How do I submit a technical support incident from within the Azure portal?
A:  Submitting a support incident from the Azure portal is a three-step process.
1. Activate your technical support benefit, and obtain your Contract ID Access ID.
2. Link your support contract to your Azure subscription.
3. Submit a support incident.

Please visit the [Technical support](vs-tech-support.md) documentation for complete details.

### Q: Who owns the intellectual property I create using my Azure DevTest individual credit?
A:  Intellectual property produced by an employee created on resources provided by that company is thereby intellectual property of the company providing the resource. So, if you received your Visual Studio subscription through your employer, their intellectual property policies would apply.
