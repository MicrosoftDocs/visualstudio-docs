# Visual Studio subscriptions offered to partners in the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)
Partners who earn a competency or who purchase the Action Pack in MPN are eligible to use Visual Studio subscriptions. These subscriptions are licensed per user, and are only valid when 
assigned to a specific named user who works for the partner company. 

## Subscriptions for partners with an MPN competency
When a partner earns a competency--either at the silver or gold level--partners earn a core number of Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions. This core benefit changes if the partner earns 
at least one gold competency. The Visual Studio Enterprise subscription is a custom offering that is roughly equivalent to the [Visual Studio Enterprise annual cloud subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/), 
but with certain benefits removed (many of which are offered separately to partners as general MPN benefits rather than as part of the Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions offered 
through MPN). 

### Core Visual Studio Benefit for earning at least one competency of any kind
| Competencies earned only at the silver level               | At least one competency earned at the gold level   | 
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                   | 10 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions          |

### Additional Visual Studio Benefit for Select Competencies
| Competency                                  | Additional subscriptions earned for **silver** competency | Additional subscriptions earned for **gold** competency |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Application Development                     | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Customer Relationship Management      | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Platform                              | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Productivity                          | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| DevOps                                      | 1 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                |

Regardless of how many competencies a partner earns, the number of Visual Studio subscriptions are limited as follows:

### Limits for Visual Studio subscriptions earned through competencies
| Maximum benefit for partners with only silver competencies                   | Maximum benefit for partners with at least one gold competency               | 
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions per country; 75 worldwide          | 50 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions per country; 150 worldwide         |


## Subscriptions for partners purchasing the Action Pack
Partners with a competency are not eligible to purchase the Action Pack. Only one Action Pack can be purchased per partner.

With the Action Pack, the partner earns **3 Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscriptions**. Visual Studio Professional (MPN) is a custom offering without a commercially-available 
equivalent in the market. Here is what is included:
- Visual Studio Professional -- latest version only
- Windows Enterprise -- latest version only, to use for development and testing only
- Windows Server -- latest version only, to use for development and testing only

Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscribers can also download and use free software for their development, including the SQL Server Developer Edition.

The Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscription does not include VSTS benefits, monthly Azure credits, technical support, training, or other subscriber benefits that are available 
with Visual Studio subscriptions that are offered commercially.

## Internal use only restriction
MPN rules stipulate that all software offered as a program benefit can only be used internally. This applies to the software offered for the individual Visual Studio subscribers' use, and the 
overall MPN software license benefits. 

This internal use-only restriction essentially means that partners cannot use the software as part of work that they do for parties outside their own organization. So building an app that will be 
used by partner employees only is fine, but building an app that is part of a client project would not be allowed.

## Sign in required with Visual Studio
With Visual Studio subscriptions offered via MPN, the licensed user must sign in to Visual Studio using the same identity/login that was used to activate the Visual Studio subscription. 
Product keys are not offered to unlock the product, sign in is the only option for running Visual Studio. The Visual Studio subscriber can operate offline for up to 30 days before Visual Studio 
stops working. While working online, Visual Studio silently refreshes the user's license status periodically to ensure the subscription is still valid.
