# Visual Studio subscriptions offered to partners in the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)

Partners who earn a competency or who purchase the Action Pack in MPN are eligible to use Visual Studio subscriptions. These subscriptions are licensed per user, and are only valid when assigned to a specific named user who works for the partner company.

## Subscriptions for partners with an MPN competency

When a partner earns a competency--either at the silver or gold level--partners earn a core number of Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions. This core benefit changes if the partner earns at least one gold competency. The Visual Studio Enterprise subscription is a custom offering that is roughly equivalent to the [Visual Studio Enterprise Standard subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/),
but with certain benefits removed (many of which are offered separately to partners as general MPN benefits rather than as part of the Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions offered through MPN).

### Core Visual Studio benefit for earning at least one competency of any kind

| Competencies earned only at silver level               | At least one competency earned at gold level   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                   | 10 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions          |

### Additional Visual Studio benefit for select competencies

| Competency                                  | Additional subscriptions earned for **silver** competency | Additional subscriptions earned for **gold** competency |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Application Development                     | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Customer Relationship Management      | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Platform                              | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| Cloud Productivity                          | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions               |
| DevOps                                      | 5 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                  | 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions                |

Regardless of how many competencies a partner earns, the number of Visual Studio subscriptions is limited as follows:

### Limits for Visual Studio subscriptions earned through competencies

| Maximum benefit for partners with only silver competencies                   | Maximum benefit for partners with at least one gold competency               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 25 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions per country/region; 75 worldwide          | 50 Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions per country/region; 150 worldwide         |

## Subscriptions for partners purchasing the Action Pack

Partners with a competency are eligible to purchase the Action Pack. Only one Action Pack can be purchased per partner.

With the Action Pack, the partner earns **3 Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscriptions**. Visual Studio Professional (MPN) is a custom offering without a commercially-available equivalent in the market. Here is what is included:

- Visual Studio Professional -- latest version only
- Windows Enterprise -- latest version only, to use for development and testing only
- Windows Server -- latest version only, to use for development and testing only

Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscribers can also download and use software for their development, including the SQL Server Developer Edition.

The Visual Studio Professional (MPN) subscription does not include Azure DevOps Services benefits, Azure DevTest individual credit, technical support, training, or other subscriber benefits that are available with Visual Studio subscriptions that are offered commercially.

## Internal use-only restriction

MPN rules stipulate that all software offered as a program benefit can only be used internally. This applies to the software offered for the individual Visual Studio subscribers' use, and the overall MPN software license benefits.

This internal use-only restriction essentially means that partners cannot use the software as part of work that they do for parties outside their own organization. Building an app that will be used by partner employees only is fine, but building an app that is part of a client project is not allowed.

## Sign-in required with Visual Studio

With Visual Studio subscriptions offered via MPN, the licensed user must sign in to Visual Studio using the same identity/login that was used to activate the Visual Studio subscription. Product keys are not offered to unlock the product; signing in is the only option for running Visual Studio. The Visual Studio subscriber can operate offline for up to 30 days before Visual Studio stops working. While working online, Visual Studio silently refreshes the user's license status periodically to ensure the subscription is still valid.
