## Frequently asked questions

### Q: I have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, but I don't see the Cloud Academy (a QA company) tile on the Benefits page. What's wrong?

A: Not all Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions include the Cloud Academy benefit. Check the [eligibility table](#eligibility) to see whether your subscription is eligible. Furthermore, the Cloud Academy benefit is offered for a limited time and while supplies last. If you have a qualifying subscription and don’t see the benefit tile, it means that the benefit is no longer available.

### Q: Can I use the Cloud Academy benefit more than once?

A:  The Cloud Academy benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions doesn't renews when your subscription renews.

### Q: The Cloud Academy (a QA company) benefit tile doesn't have an Activate link. How can I activate the benefit?

A:  If you've already activated your Cloud Academy benefit, the **Activate** link is replaced with a link that takes you to the sign-in page for Cloud Academy. You see the date you activated the benefit and information about how much time remains on your subscription. If you've already used the Cloud Academy benefits for a Visual Studio subscription, you can't activate benefits again.

### Q: What happens when my Cloud Academy benefit ends?

A:  At the end of your free Cloud Academy subscription, you might choose to purchase a subscription directly from Cloud Academy and continue your training. For full details, contact [Cloud Academy (a QA company)](https://www.qa.com/self-paced-learning/).
