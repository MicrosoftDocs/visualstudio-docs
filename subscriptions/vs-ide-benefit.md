# The Visual Studio IDE
As a Visual Studio subscriber, you have access to the Visual Studio IDE.  The specific version will depend on the level of your subscription.  The benefit will appear as a tile in the Tools category on the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page of the subscriber portal.

## Activation steps
*(Visual Studio Enterprise is used for this example.)*

To download the IDE:
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).
2. Locate the Visual Studio IDE tile in the Tools section, and click on the **Download** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.  You can also download it from the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page.
