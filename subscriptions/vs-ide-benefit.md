# The Visual Studio 2019 benefit

As a Visual Studio subscriber, you have access to the Visual Studio IDE.  The specific version will depend on the level of your subscription.  The benefit will appear as a tile in the Tools category on the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page of the subscriber portal.

## Activation steps
