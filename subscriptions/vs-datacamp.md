# The DataCamp training benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions
Eligible Visual Studio subscriptions include subscriptions to DataCamp.  With DataCamp, you can learn all the data science skills you need from the comfort of your browser. You get to choose when and what you learn. With no software to install and no special hardware requirements, learning data science is easier than ever.

## Activation steps
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2. Locate the DataCamp benefit tile in the "Professional Development" category, and click on **Activate**.

3. On the DataCamp page, you can create a new account.  You can choose to enter an email address and password, or sign in using existing accounts from Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google.  Once you've provided your sign-in information, click **Get Started**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you begin creating your account, you may receive the following error message: "OOPS!  Your promo code is invalid or expired."  This happens because when your promo code is created, it expires after a few minutes.  If you receive this message, simply return to the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) page and click on the **Activate** link on the DataCamp benefit tile.

4. Once your account has been created, you can choose a learning path.  Options include:
    - Learning R for Data Science
    - Start Learning Python for Data Science
    - Develop your Data Science Skillset

   Just click on your chosen path to get started.

For example, if you chose the "Develop your Data Science Skillset" path, you will see the following options. Choose an option, or click **I am not sure.  Show me all career paths** to create a broader path.
