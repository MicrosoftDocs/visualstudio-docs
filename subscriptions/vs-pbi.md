# Power BI Pro in Visual Studio subscriptions

Transform your data into rich visuals for you to collect and organize.

> [!Note]
> This Power BI license is made available to learn about and experiment with Power BI capabilities, in a safe place, without impacting larger Production/Dev/Test environments.  The current offer of Power BI requires the subscriber to create their own tenant to enforce separation. If you need to have a Power BI license associated with your corporate credentials in your company tenant please work with your company admin to purchase and assign a license.

## Activation steps
To use Power BI Pro, you’ll need to set up an account or sign in using an existing account.
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2. Locate the Power BI Pro tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page. Click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.   You’ll receive a notification that the code was successfully retrieved.  Click **Activate**.

3. You may already have an account if you’ve activated certain other subscription benefits, such as Office 365 Developer Subscription or Enterprise Mobility + Security.  If an existing account is found, you’ll have the choice to add your Power BI Pro subscription to your existing account or sign up for a new account.  We highly recommend adding it to your existing account so you can access your various benefits with a single user ID.

4. To create a new account, provide your contact information, then click **Next**.

5. Next, create your user ID and password.  If you already have an account and you’re creating a new one, you’ll need to provide a different company name than you used on the existing account.  Click **Create my account**.

8. Provide your contact information, then click **Next**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Power BI Pro Benefit Contact Information](_img/vs-pbi/vs-pbi-contact-cropped.png)

9. The next page will confirm your Power BI Pro Developer (MSDN) subscription has a $0.00 price.  Click **Next**.

10. Finally, we’ll collect some payment information.  Don’t worry – you won’t be charged anything.  Notice that the price is still $0.00.  You can choose a credit card, bank account, or invoice as a form of payment.  If you choose **Invoice**, you may be asked for some feedback on why you prefer that payment method.  Please provide the information requested for your preferred payment method, and click **Place order**.

11. The next page confirms you’re all set to start using Power BI Pro.  The page will provide a link to the sign-in page.  We recommend recording the link to the sign-in page as well as your user ID.  (You will also receive a welcome email at the address you provided when you set up the account.)  You may also see an automated Office 365 Assistant window, which you can use if you have questions.  Click **Let’s get started** to continue.

12. Now that your Power BI Pro account is set up, you’ll see the Office 365 Admin center, where you can manage users and domains, install Office software, and learn about Office 365.  That’s it!  You’re ready to go.

## Frequently asked questions
### Q:  If the benefit is free, why do I have to supply a credit card number?
A:  The benefit is free, but activation uses the same system used to process paid orders.  There are two payment types available.
- Credit card.  If you provide a credit card number, your card will NOT be charged.
- Invoice.  If you select "Invoice" as the payment type, you don't need to provide a credit card number.  You can also set the interval to "annual".  That way, you'll receive a single email letting you know that an invoice is ready for you.  The invoice amount will be $0.00.

### Q:  Is the Power BI Pro benefit included in my subscription licensed for use in a production environment?
A:  Yes, you can use it in a production, with two important caveats:
- This offer requires installation on its own tenant.  If you need to have a Power BI license associated with your corporate credentials in your company tenant please work with your company admin to purchase and assign a license.
- This Power BI Pro benefit cannot be used on government tenants.

### Q:  When I try to activate Power BI Pro, I get a message "You already have an account through work".  Can I still use the benefit?
A:  Yes.  The message indicates that you're logged on to a domain that already has active Office 365 tenants on which you are not an administrator.  To add Power BI Pro to a tenant, you must be an administrator on that tenant.  To resolve this issue, follow these steps to create your own tenant.
1. When you see the message that you already have an account through work, click **Create a new account**.

2. On the next screen, provide your contact information, and click **Next**.

3. Create your user ID and password.  To take advantage of the free offer, make sure you select **.onmicrosoft.com** as the domain. Click **Create my account**.

4. The rest of the steps in the process are identical to those listed in the body of the article, beginning with step 6.

### Q:  I'm on a government tenant.  Can I use the benefit?
A:  No.  The Power BI Pro benefit cannot be added to government tenants.
