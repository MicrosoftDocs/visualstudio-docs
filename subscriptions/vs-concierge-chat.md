# Concierge Chat in Visual Studio subscriptions
The Concierge Chat service provides assistance finding product information and technical documentation as well as help with using your Visual Studio subscription benefits.

The service is available 24/7, and is currently offered in English only (for questions other than accounts, billing, and subscriptions).

## Activation steps
Getting help via the Concierge Chat service is very easy.
1. Sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

2. Locate the Concierge Chat tile in the Support section of the benefits page and click on **Chat now**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Concierge Chat Tile](_img/vs-concierge-chat/vs-concierge-chat-tile.png "Click 'Chat now' to launch a new chat session.")

3. Click **Continue**.

4. A chat window will open, and you'll see a counter showing your position in the queue.

5. When an agent is available, the chat will start.
