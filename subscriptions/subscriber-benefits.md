# Benefits included in your Visual Studio subscription

Visual Studio subscriptions offer the most comprehensive set of resources for you to create, deploy, and manage great applications on your preferred platforms and devices, including Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux.  The specific benefits will vary based on the type of subscription you have.
