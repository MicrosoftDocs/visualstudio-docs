# The CloudPilot benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions
Move your apps to Microsoft Azure in a few easy steps. In minutes, identify all required code changes down to the line of code for successful migration to: Containers, VMs, App Services, SQL Azure, and/or SQL MI. Then, migrate apps to Azure using wizards leveraging ASR, DMA, and DMS.

## Overview
CloudPilot, by UnifyCloud, is designed to help developers quickly and easily move applications to Azure.  In a fraction of time a manual assessment would take, CloudPilot accurately determines Azure PaaS & IaaS migration costs and provides detailed recommendations, down to the line of code, on what code changes need to be made for the application to run in the Cloud. CloudPilot assists in the initial assessment of the Cloud migration effort and in development planning, in the re-factoring process by offering detailed code-level changes for the Cloud, and in the final testing against enterprise technology controls and policies.
