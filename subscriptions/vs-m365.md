# Microsoft 365 developer subscription in Visual Studio subscriptions

Starting in September 2019, all **new** members of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program (including Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscribers) can sign up for a Microsoft 365 E5 (Enterprise 5) developer subscription (Windows not included). This subscription replaces the Office 365 E3 (Enterprise 3) developer subscription that we made available starting in March 2018. It now includes EMS (Enterprise Mobility + Security), something our customers asked us for on User Voice. Check out the recent [Developer Blog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/new-microsoft-365-e5-subscription-with-ems-now-available-for-developers/) for more information.

Selected Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise standard subscriptions have access to the Microsoft 365 developer subscription benefit as long as their subscriptions are active.

## What is different about E5 vs E3?

The Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription offers new value and expanded access to critical Microsoft 365 workloads and capabilities. Developers with Microsoft 365 E5 sandbox subscriptions can get everything they enjoyed in E3 plus can take advantage of:

+ Advanced analytics with Power BI
+ Enterprise Mobility + Security  for compliance and information protection
+ Microsoft Defender for Office 365 
+ Microsoft Entra ID for building advanced identity and access management solutions

To see what the Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription includes, see the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program FAQ](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#whats-included-in-the-developer-subscription).

## Migrate from Office 365 E3 to Microsoft 365 E5

Visual Studio subscribers can now migrate Office 365 E3 developer sandbox subscriptions to Microsoft 365 E5.

Last August, we made Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions available to new Developer Program members. We have since heard feedback from our existing members that you would like to take advantage of the same benefits. We also recognize that many Visual Studio subscribers and Microsoft 365 developers need to have the most up-to-date Microsoft 365 technology for their developer sandboxes.

We're pleased to announce that existing members of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program can now get the benefits of a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription. If you would like to migrate to a new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, you can delete your current subscription and replace it now.

To get your new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, go to your [dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/profile) and complete these steps: 

1. On your subscription tile, select **Delete subscription**.
1. Confirm that you want to delete your subscription by typing the name of your domain in the dialog box.
1. The setup process for your new Microsoft 365 E5 subscription starts automatically.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Microsoft 365 Migration Process](_img/visualstudio-microsoft365/migration.png "Screenshot of the Delete subscription dialog. The subscription name and Delete subscription buttons are highlighted.")

After you delete your Office 365 E3 subscription and create your replacement Microsoft 365 E5 subscription, your Office 365 E3 tenant will be available for 60 days to give you time to migrate your data.

For help with migrating your data, you can use the free tool [Microsoft Mover](https://mover.io/). See also the following resources:
+ [How to migrate mailboxes from one Microsoft 365 tenant to another](/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants)
+ [Using PowerShell to perform a staged migration to Office 365](/office365/enterprise/powershell/use-powershell-to-perform-a-staged-migration-to-office-365)

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: Can I activate a Microsoft 365 developer subscription using an existing tenant, or do I need to create a new one?

A: To activate the Office Developer subscription, a new tenant is required.  

### Q: Can I choose E3 or E5?

As of September 2019, new Developer Program members are only offered E5, which is our flagship version of Office 365. This version of Office 365 offers even more value than E3, and can normally cost substantially more than our previous E3 subscription.

Existing members with E3 who don’t need all the capabilities of E5 can keep their current E3 subscription and continue to renew it. We aren't requiring any existing members to move from E3 to E5. However, each member can only have one subscription at a time.

When we have a migration option for existing Developer Program members, we provide more information about how to choose and how to migrate.

### Q: How do I know which version I have?

You can verify your version now in the subscription tile located on your Microsoft 365 Developer Program dashboard.

Look for the E3 or E5 indication in your tile.

### Q: If Microsoft 365 developer subscription doesn't include Windows, how do I get Windows?

A: The Visual Studio subscriptions that include the Microsoft 365 benefit also include Windows as part of the subscriber downloads. Visit [downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads) to download Windows. (If you don't see downloads enabled in your subscription, [contact your admin](contact-my-admin.md).) 

### Q:  How many Microsoft 365 Developer Program accounts can I create?

You can only have one Microsoft 365 Developer Program account associated with your phone number. If you need to set up a new Developer Program account, for example to use a different email account or account type, you must delete your existing account first. To delete your account, sign in to your dashboard and choose Delete Profile.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete your Developer Program account, you can only get a subscription after you have had your existing subscription for more than 60 days.
