# Deleting assignments in Visual Studio subscriptions

When a subscriber no longer requires a Visual Studio subscription, such as when they leave the company, complete a project, or switch to a new job role, you can remove their subscription and  assign it to someone else. Please note that when you reassign a subscription, the subscriber benefits will not be reset.  The new user will be able to claim any unclaimed keys and view previously claimed keys but claim limits are **not** reset. 
1.	Click the name of the subscriber you want to remove. To select multiple subscribers for removal, hold down the **CTRL** key and click each subscriber you wish to remove, or press **CTRL + A** to select and remove all subscribers. The image below shows three subscribers selected.
2.	To delete the selected subscriber(s), click **Delete**. 
3.  When the message appears asking you to confirm the deletion, click **OK**.
