# The MSDN Magazine benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions has been discontinued.

MSDN Magazine recently announced that it will publish its last edition in November 2019.  The change was announced in a [blog post](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt833502.aspx?) on msdn.microsoft.com in August 2019.  

## The announcement
Here's an excerpt of the announcement on msdn.microsoft.com:

    "Dear reader,

    After more than three decades providing technical guidance to the community of Microsoft developers, MSDN Magazine will publish its last issue in November. All previous issues will be archived and available online.

    MSDN Magazine originally started as two separate magazines, Microsoft Systems Journal and Microsoft Internet Developer, which consolidated into MSDN Magazine in 2000. Our first issue that year was entirely devoted to the Windows operating environment. How far have we all come since then? As Microsoft products and services expanded exponentially over the years, MSDN Magazine has gone through its own evolution, as well. We realized that it is time to retire MSDN Magazine and to carry on its work through Web channels like docs.microsoft.com.

    Subscribers of MSDN Magazine who have paid for their subscriptions will receive a pro-rated refund, based on time remaining on their subscription. The refund checks will be mailed out to those subscribers after the November issue has published."
