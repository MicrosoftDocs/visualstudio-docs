## Frequently asked questions

### Q: If the subscription is free, why am I being asked for a credit card?  

A: It's cost-prohibitive to send free printed copies internationally. Subscribers who choose the print edition of CODE magazine and reside outside of the United States are charged a fee for shipping. To avoid shipping charges, choose the digital version of the magazine. 

### Q: Why do I need to provide a delivery address for a digital subscription?

A:  CODE Magazine collects your address, regardless of whether the subscription is for a print or digital subscription to support fulfillment, offer selection, and digital access processes. For more information about what CODE Magazine does with your data, see their [Privacy Policy](https://www.codemag.com/Home/Privacy).
