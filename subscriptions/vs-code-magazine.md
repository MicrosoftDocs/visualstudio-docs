If you don't see all your subscriptions, you may have one or more assigned to a different email address.  You'll need to sign in with that email address to see those subscriptions.

## Frequently asked questions
### Q: If the subscription is free, why am I being asked for a credit card?  
A: It is cost-prohibitive to send free printed copies internationally.  Subscribers who choose the print edition of CODE magazine and reside outside of the United States will be charged a fee for shipping. To avoid shipping charges, choose the digital version of the magazine. 

### Q: Why do I need to provide a delivery address for a digital subscription?
A:  CODE Magazine collects your address, regardless of whether the subscription is for a print or digital subscription to support fulfillment, offer selection, and digital access processes.  For more information about what CODE Magazine does with your data, please see their [Privacy Policy](https://www.codemag.com/Home/Privacy).
