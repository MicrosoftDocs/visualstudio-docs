## How do I manage administrators?

If you are a Super Admin you can add or remove other Super Admins or Administrators. Administrators can only add or remove subscribers and will not see the Manage Administrators tab in the [Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).

To manage administrators:

1. Select the [Manage Administrators](https://manage.visualstudio.com/administrators) tab at the top of the page on [manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
2. To add, select Add and type the name and email address of the person you would like to add, select the appropriate agreement from the drop down menu, select the language that they should receive their welcome email in, and select Super Admin.
3. To remove, simply select the person you would like to remove and select Delete.

Cloud subscriptions are managed by administrators who are assigned to the Azure subscription used to purchase the cloud subscriptions. The owner of the subscription is automatically assigned as the first administrator.

To assign more administrators:

1. Connect to the Azure Portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with the account you used to purchase the Visual Studio Cloud subscriptions.
3. In the left navigation pane, scroll down to  Cost Management + Billing.
4. In the My subscriptions  list, choose the Azure subscription that you used to make the purchase.
5. Click Access control, which is located near the top of the list in the left navigation pane.
6. Click the  Add tab at the top of the page.
7. In the fly-out pane on the right, click on the name of the subscriber you wish to make an administrator.
8. Click on the  Role drop-down at the top of the pane, scroll down, and select  User Access Administrator.
9. Click  Save.
