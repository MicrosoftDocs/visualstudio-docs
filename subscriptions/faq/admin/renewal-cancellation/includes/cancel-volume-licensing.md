## How do I cancel my Visual Studio subscriptions purchased via my Volume License Agreement?

Microsoft’s Volume Licensing program doesn't allow self service cancellation. Instead, organizations must work with the authorized reseller who sold the agreement.

If you're looking to get your Visual Studio subscription removed from your Subscribers portal, you might need to contact your agreement administrator to get it removed. Visit “[Get Assistance from your subscriptions admin](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin)” for help on how to get in touch with your Administrator.
