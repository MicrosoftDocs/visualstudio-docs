Each Microsoft Volume Licensing program has specific rules and benefits, which the customer’s software reseller can help the customer understand so the customer can make the right choice. More information on Volume Licensing and the above programs can be found at: www.microsoft.com/licensing.

For more details, view the [Microsoft Visual Studio Licensing white paper](https://aka.ms/vslicensing).

### Microsoft Store
Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include: 
- [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
- [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
- [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions. To qualify to renew subscriptions at the discounted renewal price, subscriptions should be renewed before they expire. 

If you’re looking to make a one-time purchase of Visual Studio without a subscription or any of the benefits that are included with a subscription, visit the Microsoft Store for [Visual Studio Professional 2026](https://www.microsoft.com/d/visual-studio-professional-2026/dg7gmgf0vj96). 

Microsoft Store support is available by phone through the [Customer service phone numbers – Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) page or by chat using the [Store Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/sale) on the Microsoft Store website.

### Visual Studio Marketplace 
With monthly subscriptions, you can rent Visual Studio and Azure DevOps without a long-term contract. Billing is handled through your Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don’t have an Azure subscription yet—it’s free to set up and you can do it while you make your first purchase.  
- [Visual Studio Professional](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-monthly) - monthly subscription 
- [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-monthly) - monthly subscription
