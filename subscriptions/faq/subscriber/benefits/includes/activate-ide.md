## How do I download, find a key, and activate the Visual Studio IDE?
Your subscription level identifies which level of the Visual Studio IDE you have access to. For example, a Visual Studio Professional subscription does not have access to Visual Studio Enterprise. If you’re not sure which level you're using, see the subscriptions available to you by checking the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the portal. 

### How to download and activate 
1. Sign in to the subscriptions portal.  
0. For the latest release, locate the Visual Studio IDE tile in the Tools section and click on the **Download** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.  
0. You’ll be redirected to the Download Results page for Visual Studio, where you’ll have the opportunity to download the IDE.  
0. Follow the download and set up instructions. 
0. Using the email your subscription is assigned to, you’ll be able to immediately sign into the IDE after installation, **no product key is required**. Learn how to [claim a product key](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/find-keys) so you can use the IDE when you're offline.

### Find an older version 
You can also search and download previous versions from the [downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio&pgroup=) in the subscriptions portal.
