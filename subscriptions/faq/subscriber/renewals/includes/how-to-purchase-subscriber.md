## How do I purchase Visual Studio subscriptions?

Visual Studio subscriptions are available for purchase through various channels, including [Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default), the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), and [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/visualstudio).  

[Compare subscription benefits and pricing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) to understand the benefits of each Visual Studio subscription. 
Check out the [subscription benefits page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/) for more help deciding which subscription is right for you.   

### Microsoft Store
Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include: 
+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
+ [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions. To qualify to renew subscriptions at the discounted renewal price, subscriptions should be renewed before they expire. 

If you want to make a one-time purchase of Visual Studio without a subscription or any of the benefits that are included with a subscription, visit the Microsoft Store for [Visual Studio Professional 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/d/visual-studio-professional-2022/dg7gmgf0d3sj?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). 

### Visual Studio Marketplace 
With monthly subscriptions, you can rent Visual Studio and Azure DevOps without a long-term contract. Billing is handled through your Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don’t have an Azure subscription yet—it’s free to set up and you can do so while you make your first purchase.  
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-monthly) - monthly subscription 
+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-monthly) - monthly subscription
