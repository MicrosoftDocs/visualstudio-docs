## How do I activate the software I just downloaded using product keys?

Activation isn't always required for a product. In some cases, a single key can be used multiple times. In general, if a product key is required, you're asked to enter it during the installation process or on first use.

You can obtain product keys in two places:

- When you [download](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads) a product you can click on the \'Get Key\' link listed next to the product you're downloading.
- You can also find keys on the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/ProductKeys) page in the [Subscriber Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).

For more information about obtaining and using product keys, please see these articles:
