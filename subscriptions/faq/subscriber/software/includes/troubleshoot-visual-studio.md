## How do I troubleshoot problems with Visual Studio? 

If you have a question about Visual Studio, several resources are available to assist you.

### Visual Studio IDE technical support
 Visual Studio IDE technical issues or questions should be directed to [Visual Studio technical support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/). Before using the limited Visual Studio [technical support incidents](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-tech-support) that may be included with your Visual Studio subscription, we suggest trying some other online resources.
- For Visual Studio installation issues, see [Troubleshoot Visual Studio installation and upgrade issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/troubleshooting-installation-issues) for step-by-step guidance. You can also try the [installation chat](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only) support option.
- Review tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and helpful resources within [Visual Studio IDE documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/).
- Search the online [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/) and get expert answers via a community supported forum. You can search keywords and read, vote, comment all without logging in. If you don’t find what you need with a search, you can suggest a feature or report a problem from the navigation menu. To submit a feature request, you’ll need to sign in to fill out the report and post. To report a problem or bug, a running instance of Visual Studio is required to report feedback.
- Search the Stack Overflow [public Q&A tagged with visual-studio](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio?tab=Newest) to get answers to already asked questions or sign up for an account and ask a new question.

### Technical support incidents
If you’ve exhausted the options above and still don’t have an answer, activate a Visual Studio technical support ticket by visiting the [subscriptions portal benefits page](https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits) and clicking on the Technical Support benefit tile in the Support tab. Read more about the [Technical Support benefit](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-tech-support). (Technical support is not available with all subscriptions. [Compare Visual Studio subscription benefits](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription) to find out what is included with your subscription.)
