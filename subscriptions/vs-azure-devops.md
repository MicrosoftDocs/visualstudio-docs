# Azure DevOps for Visual Studio subscribers
As an active Visual Studio subscriber, you can use a range of features in Azure DevOps that are included with your subscription. You'll be able to use these same features in each Azure DevOps organization in which you are a member, whether you created the organization or were added by someone else.

## Sign in

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Azure DevOps Tile](_img/vs-azure-devops/vs-azure-devops-tile.png "Click 'Get started' to sign in to Azure DevOps.")

   
When you sign in to Azure DevOps using either the identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription or your [alternate identity](vs-alternate-identity.md), we recognize this automatically.  This way you can also add a work or school account (which you use when logging into Visual Studio, Microsoft 365, or your corporate or school network), allowing you to access Azure DevOps using both your personal account and your work or school account.

## Frequently asked questions
### Q: As a Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber, do I get additional parallel jobs for TFS and Azure Pipelines?
A:  Yes. Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers get one parallel job in Team Foundation Server 2017 or later and one self-hosted parallel job in each Azure DevOps Services organization where they are a member.
