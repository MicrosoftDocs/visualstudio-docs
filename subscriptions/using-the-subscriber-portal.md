# Using the subscriber portal - my.visualstudio.com

The Visual Studio Subscriptions Portal, [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs), is your all-in-one resource to take advantage of the full range of benefits provided through your Visual Studio subscription.

Using the portal requires that you sign in with the identity associated with your subscription.  This may be your Microsoft Account (MSA) or an email address provided to you by an organization, such as your employer or school.  Learn about [signing in](signing-in.md).

The portal is organized in six pages.  Each page provides you with access to different products or services included with your subscription.  The six pages are Benefits, Downloads, Product Keys, Subscriptions, Support, and Marketplace.

## [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs)
The tools and services included with your subscription are displayed as "tiles" on the Benefits page.  Not all benefits are included with all subscriptions. The tiles are grouped into three categories:  Tools, Professional Development, and Support.  

### Tools
The Tools category is where you'll find the core development tools, such as the Visual Studio IDE, Azure DevOps, as well as tools provided by our partners.  You'll also see services such as Azure and Visual Studio App Center.

### Professional Development
This category contains benefits such as online training from Microsoft and our partners, as well a subscription to MSDN Magazine, all to help you advance your development skills and stay abreast of all things code.

### Support
Have a question about Azure?  Get help from the Azure Community via forums, or take advantage of the Azure Advisory Chat (preview).  The Concierge Chat service is available to help you find technical documentation and product information, and to assist with subscription-related questions.  Select subscriptions also include incident-based Technical Support to help you resolve issues with a wide range of Microsoft products running in dev/test environments.

## [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs)
Depending on the subscription or program you have, you have access to software downloads ranging from updates and patches to an extensive library of current products as well as older versions so you can test your apps in a wide variety of scenarios.

To make it simple for subscribers who have multiple subscriptions associated with a single account, when you visit the Downloads page, you'll see the downloads available to the highest subscription you own.  That way, you can see all of your downloads, no matter which subscription you're currently using.

## [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs)
Visit the Product Keys page to obtain keys to install and activate products, and to see what keys you have already claimed.  You can even export a list of all of your keys for safekeeping.

## [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs)
The Subscriptions page provides you with the capabilities to see which subscriptions you own, switch between subscriptions, renew them, and activate new subscriptions. You can also associate subscriptions you access using your Microsoft Account with an alternate account that's already associated with existing Visual Studio IDE, Azure DevOps, or Azure resources.

## Support

In addition to the individual benefits found in the Support category on the Benefits page, the Support page provides access to resources to help you get the most out of your Visual Studio subscription. Access [support resources](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support/) to resolve technical issues or questions related to subscriptions sales, accounts, and billing.

## [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

Need to renew a Visual Studio cloud subscription?  Want to download the latest extensions for the Visual Studio family of products?  The Marketplace helps users find extensions, tools, and services that make Azure DevOps, Azure DevOps Server, and Visual Studio Code even better. You can even become a publisher, and publish your own extensions on the Marketplace.
