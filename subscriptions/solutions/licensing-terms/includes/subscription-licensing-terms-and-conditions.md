## What are the subscription licensing terms and conditions? 

All Visual Studio subscriptions are licensed on a per-user basis. Each licensed user may install and use the software on any number of devices to design, develop, test, and demonstrate their programs. Visual Studio subscriptions also allow the licensed user to evaluate the software and to simulate customer environments in order to diagnose issues related to your programs. Each additional person who uses the software in this way must also have a license. 

For more details, [view the Microsoft Visual Studio licensing whitepaper](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Visual-Studio-Licensing-Whitepaper-Mar-2020.pdf). 

View the subscriptions available to you by checking the drop down on [the benefits page in the subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).
