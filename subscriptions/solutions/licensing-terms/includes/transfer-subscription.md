## Can I transfer my subscription and all rights included to another user?

According to the licensing whitepaper, subscriptions can be transferred to other users. When that happens, the previous owner of the subscription loses the rights to the software and keys they claimed before the transfer.

For more details, [view the Microsoft Visual Studio licensing whitepaper](https://aka.ms/vslicensing). 

## How do I initiate a subscription transfer?
Each subscription type is managed in a different way – Visual Studio Subscriptions support might need to transfer some for you; your company manages others. To check which subscription type you own, go to the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), select the "support information" link and compare the subscription channel with the following listing:

+ Retail – Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" button on this page
+ Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) - Open a ticket with Visual Studio Subscriptions support using the "Online request" button on this page
+ Volume License (VL) – select the "contact my admin" button at the top of the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions)
+ Cloud – contact the admin who purchased the subscriptions through Azure
+ PartnerCenter – Contact your company admin
+ Free – anyone can join the free Dev Essentials program, there's no need to transfer

If your subscription type is different, you need to reach out to the party that provided you with the subscription.
