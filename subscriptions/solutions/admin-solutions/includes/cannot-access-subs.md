## Why can't I access my subscription?

There are several reasons you may be unable to access your subscription:

**Your subscription may be expired.**  If you purchased your subscription through the Microsoft Store, you can renew it at a discount over the cost of a new subscription.  Here are some quick links to help you renew your subscription:
- [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
- [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
- [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

**Your subscription may have been removed or reassigned by your administrator.**  If your subscription was provided to you by your work or school, it is probably managed by an administrator (admin).  If you have previously been able to access a subscription, your admin may have deleted it or reassigned it to someone else.  Please [contact your administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) for assistance.

**You may not have a subscription assigned to you by your administrator.**  If your work or school manages subscriptions for the organization, you may not have a subscription assigned.  If you have one assigned, you should have an email message confirming the assignment of the subscription.  Please make sure you're using the same email address where you received that notification to sign in to your subscription. Please [contact your administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) for assistance. 

**You may be signing in with the wrong credentials.**  If you're confident that you have a subscription but you're either not able to sign in or you can sign in and the subscription is not displayed, you may be signing in with a different email address than is associated with the subscription.  If you have more than one subscription, it's also possible that you're simply displaying the wrong one.  Use the subscription picker at the top of the benefits page to switch between subscriptions.  To see all of the subscriptions associated with your sign-in email address and select the one you wish to use, visit the [subscriptions tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).
