## How to request a Visual Studio subscription from your work/school
Many organizations, including workplaces and schools, purchase Visual Studio subscriptions through a variety of licensing programs.  These subscriptions are managed by subscriptions administrators (admins) who can assign subscriptons, establish preferences, and enable or disable certain features.  

**Contact your subscription administrator to request a subscription**
To use a subscription managed by your organization, one must first be assigned to you by an admin.  You will need to contact an admin to request a subscription.  In large organizations it may be difficult to know who your admin is.  Many organizations have multiple admins.  

If you are unsure who your admins are, you may find it helpful to contact a colleague who has a subscription assigned to them.  Existing subscribers can visit https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions.  They'll see a **Contact my Admin** button at the top right which they can use to send messages to admins.  The button does not expose the names or emails of the admins, though, so your colleague will need to ask an admin to contact you about your request.  

**Use the Contact my Admin feature**
Please view our [Contact my Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) article for more information about the feature.
