## Why am I only seeing my Visual Studio Dev Essentials membership?

If you're not seeing all of your subscriptions, the most common causes are:

- **Your subscriptions are associated with different email aliases.**  For example, if your Dev Essentials membership is associated with your Microsoft Account (MSA), which typically uses an email address like myname@outlook.com, and you have subscriptions provided to you by your work or school that are associated to a different alias such as myname@contoso.com.  To see those subscriptions, you'll need to sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com) with your work/school credentials.  
- **You need to change which subscription is displayed.** If you have multiple subscriptions associated with the email you use to sign in, you can switch between them in two ways:
    - Click on the **Subscriptions** tab to display a list of your subscriptions.  Click on the one you wish to use. 
    - Click on the **Subscription** picker at the top-right of your benefits page and choose the desired subscription. 
- **Your subscription has been removed.**  If your subscription was provided to you by your work or school, your administrator may have removed it. [Contact your subscriptions administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) for assistance.
- **Your subscription may have expired.** If you purchased your own subscription from Microsoft Store, it may have expired.  In that case, you would need to renew it to regain access.  Please see our article about [buying subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/buy-activate-retail) for more information.
