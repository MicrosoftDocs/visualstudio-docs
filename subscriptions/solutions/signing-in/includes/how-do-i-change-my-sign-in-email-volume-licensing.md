## How to change your sign-in email address

If your work or school purchased subscriptions through Volume Licensing or the Visual Studio Marketplace, they are managed by administrators.  Your administrator can change the email address you use to sign into your subscription.  

## How to contact your administrator 

Given the size and complexity of many organizations, you may not be aware of who your admin is, but there is a feature in the subscriptions portal to assist you with contacting your admin. 

1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).  
1. Click the Contact my Admin button at the top right. 
1. Enter the message for your admin. 
1. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, click the Send me a copy checkbox. Finally, click Send.
