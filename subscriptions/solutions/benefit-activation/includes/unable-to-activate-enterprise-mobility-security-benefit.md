## I'm unable to activate my Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) benefit.

Starting in September 2019, Enterprise Mobility + Security for compliance and information protection is included in the Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription. This replaces the Office 365 E3 developer subscription and separate Enterprise Mobility + Security benefit previously available. 

## Activate Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription  

1. Sign in to [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). 
1. Locate the Microsoft 365 benefit tile in the "Tools" category, and click on Activate. 
1. Follow the prompts to set up your Microsoft 365 E5 subscription 
1. On the Add new users page, you'll see a grid you can use to add users who will all have licenses assigned to them. If you need to add more users click + Add another user. 
1. After you add users, you'll have the option to do things like create teams and install applications. You can either do any or all of those things now, or come back to the admin center any time to set those up. 

## Migrate from Office 365 E3 to Microsoft 365 E5 

Visual Studio subscribers can now migrate Office 365 E3 developer sandbox subscriptions to Microsoft 365 E5. If you would like to migrate to a new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, you can delete your current subscription and replace it now. 

To get your new Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, go to your dashboard and do the following: 
1. On your subscription tile, click Delete subscription. 
1. Confirm that you want to delete your subscription by typing the name of your domain in the dialog box. 
1. The setup process for your new Microsoft 365 E5 subscription will start automatically. 

After you delete your Office 365 E3 subscription and create your replacement Microsoft 365 E5 subscription, your Office 365 E3 tenant will be available for 60 days so that you can migrate your data.
