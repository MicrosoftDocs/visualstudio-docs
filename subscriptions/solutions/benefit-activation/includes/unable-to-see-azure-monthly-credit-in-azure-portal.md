## I'm unable to see my Azure monthly credit in the Azure portal.

There are multiple reasons you might not be able to see the Azure monthly credit. You may be using the wrong email to sign in, you may be signed in with the correct email but in the wrong directory, or you may not have yet activated your monthly credit benefit. 

## Azure subscription sign in 

When you activate your monthly credit, we link the email that you used during activation with your Visual Studio subscription.  

You can also associate an [alternate account](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure, with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to.  

You will need to sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the email you set the account up with. For example, if you activated your monthly credit with your alternate account, you must always sign into your Azure subscription with that email. 

## Azure directories
 
You can have multiple directories as part of your Azure subscription. Make sure you are using the directory you set up the Azure subscription. You can view and switch directories by clicking on the account icon in the top right corner in the Azure portal. 

## How to activate your Azure monthly credit

1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits)  
1. Locate the Azure dev/test individual credit tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page and click Activate link at the bottom of the benefit tile. If you can’t locate the Azure monthly credit tile, please use the [benefits comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription) to verify that your subscription includes a monthly credit. 
1. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you'll be asked to fill in the required personal information to create one.  
1. Accept the subscriptions agreement and you’re ready to go. In the future you can access your Azure subscription at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Geographic restrictions 

Azure subscriptions created via the Visual Studio Subscriptions benefit may be impacted by restrictions that aren’t imposed on paid subscriptions. Certain geographies may not be available for creating VMs and Azure services, and certain service types may not be available. There may be a lower default quota than on paid subscriptions.
