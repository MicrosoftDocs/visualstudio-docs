## How do I activate my monthly Azure dev/test individual credit? 

There is no cost to use your Azure dev/test individual credit and no credit card is required. When you run out of the credit that’s allotted for the month, you won’t be able to continue using Azure resources until the credit resets the next month or you remove the spending limit and add a payment method.  

## How to activate Azure monthly credit

1. Sign in to the [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) 
1. Locate the Azure dev/test individual credit tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page and click Activate link at the bottom of the benefit tile. If you can’t locate the Azure monthly credit tile, please use the [benefits comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription) to verify that your subscription includes a monthly credit. 
1. If you don't have an existing Azure subscription, you'll be asked to fill in the required personal information to create one.  
1. Accept the subscriptions agreement and you’re ready to go. In the future you can access your Azure subscription at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). 

## Geographic restrictions may apply 

Azure subscriptions created via the Visual Studio Subscriptions benefit may be impacted by restrictions that aren’t imposed on paid subscriptions. Certain geographies may not be available for creating VMs and Azure services, and certain service types may not be available. There may be a lower default quota than on paid subscriptions.
