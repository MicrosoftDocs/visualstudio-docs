## Why don't I see any subscription benefits on my benefits page?
The benefits available to you depend on the subscription you're using. You can find what benefits you're eligible for by going through [documentation about benefits](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/about-benefits).

Alternatively, you can also go to [benefit comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/#benefits) to see what benefits should be available under your subscription type and level. You can find your subscription level and type on [Subscriptions tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the subscriptions portal. 

If you're eligible for a benefit and still can't find it, check if your subscription is active on the [Subscriptions tab](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

Should you need further assistance, create a case with Visual Studio Subscriptions support by clicking the "Online request" link on this page.
