## How do I renew subscriptions?

The way you renew subscriptions depends on how they were originally purchased. 
+ Monthly or annual subscriptions purchased through Visual Studio Marketplace renew automatically until you cancel them, so no action is needed. 
+ Subscriptions purchased through a Volume Licensing agreement are handled through your organization’s primary contact and your reseller. These agreements are typically renewed for 1-3 year periods. Sometimes a super admin is also the primary contact and would likely know the status of the renewal. 
+ Retail Visual Studio subscriptions (Enterprise, Professional, and Test Professional) give you the option to purchase a new subscription or renew an existing one. You might do so through the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/visualstudio?rtc=1) or by connecting to the [My.VisualStudio.com](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) portal and select the "Renew" link.

You must renew your subscription purchased through the Microsoft Store within 30 days from the expiration date to qualify for renewal pricing. 

Microsoft Store support is available by phone through the [Customer service phone numbers – Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) page or by chat using the [Store Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/sale) on the Microsoft Store website.
