## Renewing retail subscriptions through Microsoft Store 

Your subscription should be renewed before the expiration date to ensure access to the included developer tools and software. Renewal pricing is available only for existing Visual Studio Subscriptions customers who have purchased from the Microsoft Store in the past, within 30 days of their expiration date. 

If your subscription isn't expired, your expiration date can be found on the Subscriptions tab in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). 

## Retail subscriptions available for renewal

Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available to renew through the Microsoft Store include: 

+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/DG7GMGF0DST4/0003?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
+ [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions.  

## How to renew 

If you have a standard retail subscription, it was purchased from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store) and should be renewed there.  

1. Visit the store and find the subscription level you currently have (you can only renew the same subscription level). 
1. Select "Download – Renewal" and add to cart. If you want to change your subscription level, select "Download – New."  
1. Check out. The confirmation page includes a product key to use to activate the subscription. See activation instructions in next section.

## How to activate  

After you renew a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you'll need to activate the subscription using the key you receive. Purchasing of the key doesn't equal activation of a subscription.

The "scenario table" helps determine whether the Visual Studio Subscriptions team or the Microsoft Store team is best suited to support your request.

Microsoft Store support is available by phone through the [Customer service phone numbers – Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) page or by chat using the [Store Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/sale) on the Microsoft Store website.

For Visual Studio Subscriptions issues, scroll to the **"Still need help with Visual Studio Subscriptions?"** section and select **"Create a support ticket"** to ensure that your request routes to the appropriate support team.
