## Renewing subscriptions through Microsoft Store 

Your subscription should be renewed before the expiration date to ensure access to the included developer tools and software. Renewal pricing is available only for existing Visual Studio Subscriptions customers who have purchased from the Microsoft Store in the past, and are within five months of their expiration date. You do not qualify for renewal pricing if your subscription has been expired for longer than five months. 

If your subscription is not expired, you will find your expiration date by viewing your subscriptions in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). 

## Subscriptions available for renewal

Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available to renew through the Microsoft Store include: 

* [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/DG7GMGF0DST4/0003?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
* [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
* [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions.  

## How to renew 

If you have a standard retail subscription, it was purchased from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store) and should be renewed there.  

1. Visit the store and find the subscription level you currently have (you can only renew the same subscription level). 
1. Click on “Download – Renewal” and add to cart. If you want to change your subscription level, you will need to click on “Download – New.”  
1. Check out. On the confirmation page, you will be given a product key you will need to use to activate the subscription. See instructions below. 

## How to activate  

After you renew a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you can begin the activation process from the payment confirmation page or confirmation email you received after your purchase. 

1. Navigate to the [subscriptions portal activation page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate). 
1. Sign in with the email that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription. 
1. Enter your product key in the "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" pop-up window. You will find this key on the payment confirmation page or in confirmation email. 

The subscription should now be visible on the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) and you should have access to all your subscription benefits.
