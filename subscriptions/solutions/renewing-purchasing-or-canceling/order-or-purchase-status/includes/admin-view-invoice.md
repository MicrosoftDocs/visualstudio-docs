## Where can I view my invoice?

Locating your invoice depends on the method of purchase you did for your subscriptions.

Monthly and annual subscriptions purchased from the Visual Studio Marketplace are billed through Azure. Your invoices can be viewed in the Azure portal
1. Sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select **Cost Management + Billing** in the menu
3. Select the list of subscriptions, and then invoices.

If you purchased your subscriptions through a Volume Licensing agreement, contact your reseller for additional information.
