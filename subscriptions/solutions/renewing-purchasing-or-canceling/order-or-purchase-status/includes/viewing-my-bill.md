## Where can I view my Azure invoice?
Your Azure invoice can include payments for Azure services and some types of Visual Studio subscriptions.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select “Cost Management + Billing” in the menu to find an overview, list of subscriptions, and invoices.

## Visual Studio subscriptions
Monthly (and annual if purchased before December 2018) subscriptions are billed through Azure, you can find your invoice in the same Azure billing section.

## Understanding spending limit in Azure
The spending limit feature in Azure allows you to set a spending limit to automatically disable services. By default the spending limit is applied to the Azure Dev/Test individual credit benefit. Read more about the [Azure spending limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit).

You're billed monthly for services if:
+ You've removed the spending cap on your Azure subscription
+ You have converted your subscription to Pay-As-You-Go
+ You're taking advantage of enterprise Azure Dev/Test pricing only available to Visual Studio subscribers
+ You want to utilize services outside of the services used for development and testing covered by the monthly credit

Get answers to [common questions about your usage and charges](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/getting-started).

## How do I view my purchases through Microsoft Store?
View the order confirmations for the products you purchased by signing in to [https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders) with the email address you used for the purchase.

## Can I add VAT ID to the Microsoft Store order?
The Microsoft Online Store is designed for consumer purchases only, using a Microsoft Account with the credit card or any other associated payment instrument to purchase products as individual and consumer. This limitation applies to consumer products and to commercial standalone products and subscriptions sold at the Microsoft Online Store. 

As a result you only receive a "simplified invoice" linked to your MSA address.
 
A “simplified invoice” can't be edited, doesn't contain  business relevant data (such as VAT ID), and may not qualify as a valid VAT invoice in your region. 

## Volume licensing
If you purchased your subscriptions through a Volume Licensing agreement, contact your reseller for additional information.
