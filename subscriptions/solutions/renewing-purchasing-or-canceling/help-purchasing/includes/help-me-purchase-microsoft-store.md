## Purchase subscriptions through Microsoft Store 

Standard retail subscriptions can be purchased through the Microsoft Store.  

## Subscriptions available 

Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include: 

* [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
* [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
* [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions.  

## How to purchase 

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store) and find the subscription you want to purchase.
2. Click on “Download - New” and add to cart. 

Note: Sometimes the store will default to showing the renewal price, make sure you are purchasing a new subscription. The store will not validate that you have a current subscription while purchasing at renewal price. You can't activate the renewal without a current matching subscription.

3. Check out. On the confirmation page, you'll be given a product key to use to activate the subscription. See instructions below. 

## How to activate your subscription 

After you purchase a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you can begin the activation process from the payment confirmation page or confirmation email you received after your purchase. 

1. Navigate to the [subscriptions portal activation page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate).
1. Sign in with the email that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription. 
1. Enter your product key in the "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" pop-up window. You will find this key on the payment confirmation page or in confirmation email. 

The subscription should now be visible on the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) and you should have access to all your subscription benefits.
