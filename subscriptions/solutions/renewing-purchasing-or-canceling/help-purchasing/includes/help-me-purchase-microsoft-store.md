## Purchase subscriptions through Microsoft Store 

Standard retail subscriptions can be purchased through the Microsoft Store.  

## Subscriptions available 

Retail Visual Studio subscriptions available through the Microsoft Store include: 

+ [Visual Studio Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-enterprise-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)
+ [Visual Studio Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) 
+ [Visual Studio Test Professional](https://www.microsoft.com/p/visual-studio-test-professional-subscription/dg7gmgf0dst6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab)

Each of these subscriptions offers the option to make an initial purchase or to renew an existing subscription. Renewal pricing reflects a significant discount and is only available for existing subscriptions.  

## How to purchase 

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store) and find the subscription you want to purchase.
2. Select "Download - New" and add to cart. 

Note: Sometimes the store defaults to showing the renewal price, make sure you're purchasing a new subscription. The store doesn't validate that you have a current subscription while purchasing at renewal price. You can't activate the renewal without a current matching subscription.

3. Check out. The confirmation page includes a product key to use to activate the subscription. See activation instructions in next section.

## How to activate your subscription 

After you purchase a Visual Studio subscription through the Microsoft Store, you'll need to activate the subscription using the key you receive. Purchasing of the key doesn't equal activation of a subscription.

1. Navigate to the [subscriptions portal activation page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate).
1. Sign in with the email that requires access to the Visual Studio subscription. 
1. Enter your product key in the "Activate Your Visual Studio Subscription" pop-up window. You can find this key on the payment confirmation page or in confirmation email. 

The subscription should now be visible on the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) and you should have access to all your subscription benefits. 

## Compare subscription benefits
