## How can I purchase more Visual Studio subscriptions?

There are several different options for purchasing more subscriptions. (You might want to purchase through the same channel as your current subscriptions to make it easier to maintain billing.)

+ [Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy?rtc=1) – Subscriptions are available to purchase through a reseller when an organization needs to purchase a large quantity of subscriptions. 

+ Visual Studio Marketplace ([Professional](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-monthly) and [Enterprise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-monthly)) – Monthly subscriptions, which allow you to rent Visual Studio and Azure DevOps without a long-term contract. Billing is handled through your Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don’t have an Azure subscription, it’s free to set up and can be done when you make your first purchase.

+ [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/collections/visualstudio?rtc=1) (Enterprise, Professional, and Test Professional) – Retail Visual Studio subscriptions offering the option to make an individual purchase or to renew an existing one.
