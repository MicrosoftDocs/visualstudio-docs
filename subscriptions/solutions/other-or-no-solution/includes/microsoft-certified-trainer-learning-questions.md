## I need help with the activation or creation of MCT subscriptions. How can I get Support? 

To activate or create your Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) subscription **review MCT program requirements and benefits under** [Microsoft Certified Trainer | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/mct-certification) and [New MCT Enrollment Process | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/mct-enrollment).

If you require further assistance, create an online support request for help with MCT applications, renewals, benefits, or tool access by visiting the MCT Portal at https://aka.ms/mctportal. The MCT portal is the official site for managing MCT access and subscriptions.

## Who can help with my Microsoft Credentials related issues?  

If you have an issue related to **Microsoft Credentials**, such as exams, certifications, transcripts, or your Learn profile, the right team to assist you is **Microsoft Learning Support**. To get help, you need to create a support ticket directly with the Learning team. You can create a ticket by visiting the official support portal at [Services Hub](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=de16815f-2fa5-576e-4946-70cae21a4eeb.).

Developer Support doesn't handle Microsoft Credentials issues, submitting your request through this link ensures it reaches the correct team for resolution.

## I have Visual Studio Subscription (VSS) access/benefit activation issues/inquiries

If you have issues or inquiries related to **Visual Studio Subscriptions (VSS) access or benefit activation**, the **Visual Studio Subscriptions support team** can assist you. Support includes activation of benefits such as **Azure credits**, **Microsoft 365 Developer**, resolving **715 errors** or other access issues on https://my.visualstudio.com, and troubleshooting software availability under VSS.

To get help, go to the Visual Studio support scroll down and select the option to **create a ticket** for your issue. Creating a ticket ensures your request is routed to the correct team for resolution.
