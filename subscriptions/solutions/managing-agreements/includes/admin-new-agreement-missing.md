## My new agreement is missing, where is it?
You’ll receive an email from Visual Studio Subscriptions after the new agreement has been added into the system or when you’ve been assigned a super admin/admin role. You can then sign in and begin managing subscriptions for that agreement. 

In most cases, you’re likely viewing an older agreement and can find your new one by checking the dropdown on the left side of the screen above your assigned subscriptions. Click on the agreement number to start managing that agreement.

Make sure that you're signing in with the email address that the permissions were given to and if your company uses Azure Active Directory, check to make sure the correct tenant is selected in the top right corner.
