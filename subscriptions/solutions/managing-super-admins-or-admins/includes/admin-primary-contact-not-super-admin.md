## I am the primary contact, but I'm not a super admin. How do I fix this?

If you are the primary contact on your organization’s Volume Licensing agreement, you will be assigned the super admin role when the agreement is set up. You should have received a welcome email from Visual Studio Subscriptions.

If you’re not seeing your super admin role, the first step is to make sure you’re signing in with the email address provided by your reseller. Contact your reseller and verify that they've entered your correct information, or verify which email address was listed in the initial welcome email. If there are any mistakes, ask the reseller to update the information on their end and wait 48 hours for the system to update. 

If you still don't have super admin permissions after 48 hours, reach out to support and have the following information ready:
- Agreement number
- Email address to be assigned


If you were added as a primary contact after the agreement was set up, ask another super admin to [add you as a super admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/admin-roles#assigning-admins).
