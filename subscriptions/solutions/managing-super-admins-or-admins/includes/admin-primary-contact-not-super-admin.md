## I'm the primary contact, but I'm not a super admin. How do I fix this?

If you're the primary contact on your organization’s Volume Licensing agreement, you'll be assigned the super admin role when the agreement is set up. A welcome email will be sent from Visual Studio Subscriptions.

If you’re not seeing your super admin role, the first step is to make sure you’re signing in with the email address provided by your reseller. Contact your reseller and verify they've entered your correct information, or verify which email address was listed in the initial welcome email. If there are any mistakes, ask the reseller to update the information on their end and wait 48 hours for the system to update. 

If you still don't have super admin permissions after 48 hours, reach out to support by submitting an online request below and have the following information ready:
- Agreement number
- Email address to be assigned

If you were added as a primary contact after the agreement was set up, ask another super admin to [add you as a super admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/admin-roles#assigning-admins).
