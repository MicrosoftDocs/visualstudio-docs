## How to add another super admin or admin

There are two distinct roles: admins and super admins. Admins can assign, edit, or remove subscriptions. Super admins also have the ability to assign, edit, or remove admins or other super admins.

Follow these steps to add another admin:

1. Ensure you're added as a super admin.
2. At the top of the admin portal, browse to the **Manage administrators** page, and then select the appropriate agreement from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Fill out the required fields.

Note: For the super admin role, be sure to check the box.

## More Information

To check if you're a super admin, select the agreement details icon on left nav pane in the portal. A flyout panel shows the admin role details. 

The super admin role isn't available for [MPSA agreements](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/mpsa). Administrator permissions for those agreements are managed in the Microsoft [Business Center](https://businessaccount.microsoft.com/Customer). 

To [manage admins](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/cloud-admin) for subscriptions purchased through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
