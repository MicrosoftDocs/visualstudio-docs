## Visual Studio IDE technical support 

Visual Studio Subscriptions support provides assistance with sales, subscriptions, accounts, and billing. Visual Studio IDE technical issues or questions should be directed to [Visual Studio technical support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/). Before using the limited [Visual Studio technical support incidents](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-tech-support) that might be included with your Visual Studio subscription, we suggest trying some other online resources.

+ For Visual Studio installation issues, see [Troubleshoot Visual Studio installation and upgrade issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/troubleshooting-installation-issues) for step-by-step guidance.
