## What if you can't find the IDE feature you want to use? 

If the IDE feature your looking for isn't available, you may be using the wrong version of Visual Studio.  
To see a comprehensive list of which features are included in the various versions of Visual Studio, please visit the [Compare Visual Studio 2019 Editions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/) page. 

If you find that the feature you need is not included in your version of Visual Studio, you may need to [contact your subscription administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) to have a different Visual Studio subscription assigned to you.
