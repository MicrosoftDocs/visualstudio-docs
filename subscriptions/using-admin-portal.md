# Overview of the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administrator Portal

The Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal gives you the tools to manage your organization's subscriptions in one place.

## Important considerations

Keep these points in mind when you use the Visual Studio Subscriptions Admin Portal:
+ **Visual Studio subscriptions are licensed per user.** Each subscriber can use the software on as many computers as needed for development and testing.
+ **Assign only one subscription level for each subscriber**, corresponding to the Visual Studio subscription your organization purchased. If you have subscribers with more than one subscription level assigned to them, edit their settings so that they only have one.
+ **A subscriber’s subscription level will need to be updated** when the subscription is upgraded (after the purchase of a “step-up” license) or renewed at a lower level.
+ **Do not share subscriptions between subscribers.** Subscriptions must be assigned to named individuals.  Assignment of subscriptions to teams isn't permitted.  You must assign a subscription to anyone who uses all or part of the subscription benefits (software for development and testing, Microsoft Azure, e-learning, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio Subscriptions [subscriber portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) do not support [GCC High tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod), also known as private or government domains. This also applies to subscribers attempting to sign into the Visual Studio IDE. To access Visual Studio subscriptions, your organization will need to have a public tenant. For further assistance creating a public tenant, contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/). 

## The Subscribers page

After you’ve assigned subscriptions, the Manage subscribers tab provides detailed information about your subscribers, including:
+ The first and last name of each subscriber
+ The email address for this user
+ The subscription level assigned to them
+ The date that their subscription was assigned
+ The expiration date for their subscription
+ A reference field for notes
+ Whether subscriber downloads are enabled or disabled
+ The country/region in which they're located
+ Their language preference for the assignment communication email from the admin portal
+ An optional field for a different email address used for communications than sign-in

On the top left side of the page, there are several icons you can select to reveal a subscription assignment overview, the agreement details and the maximum usage report.

To see additional information about the number of subscription licenses purchased, assigned, and still available in your organization for each agreement, select the top icon to enable the slide-out panel.

## The Details page
