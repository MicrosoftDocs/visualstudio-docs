# Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Enterprise Mobility + Security, which has previously been available independently in selected Visual Studio subscriptions, is now included in the Microsoft 365 developer subscription that is included in those same selected Visual Studio subscriptions.

1. Locate the Microsoft 365 developer subscription tile and click **Activate**.  
1. Follow the prompts to complete creation of your account.
