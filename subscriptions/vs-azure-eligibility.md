## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q:  Can I use my Azure credits for Azure OpenAI?

A:  Yes, Azure credits can be used to pay for Azure OpenAI Service usage. However, you need to apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service first and specify your use case and mitigations. Access is currently limited as we navigate high demand, upcoming product improvements, and [Microsoft’s commitment to responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6). For now, we're working with customers with an existing partnership with Microsoft, lower risk use cases, and customers committed to incorporating mitigations.

More specific information is included in the application form. We appreciate your patience as we work to responsibly enable broader access to Azure OpenAI.
