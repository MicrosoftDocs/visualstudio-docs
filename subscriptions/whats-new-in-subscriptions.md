# What's new in Visual Studio subscriptions
We update the Subscription benefits package often to make it more useful to you. We'll also make enhancements to our subscriber and subscription management portals to provide you the best possible experience.  We'll also generate new content in response to user questions and when changes are made.  Read on to learn about the latest features and updates, sorted quarterly.

## 2022 Q1 (January - March)

### Visual Studio 2022 released
All Visual Studio subscriptions that include the Visual Studio IDE will now have access to Visual Studio 2022. You can read more about this latest release of Visual Studio in the [Visual Studio release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes).

### Admin access to expired agreements
Administrators can now view information in their expired agreements.  This will enable them to more easily migrate subscribers to new agreements.
