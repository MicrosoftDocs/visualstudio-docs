# Assign licenses in the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal
As a Visual Studio subscriptions administrator, you can use the administration portal to assign subscriptions to individual users and groups of users.

For groups of users, you have choices for how you assign subscriptions.  
- You can assign subscriptions one at a time.
- You can also quickly and easily upload lists of subscribers and their subscription information using the [Bulk add](assign-license-bulk.md) feature.
- If your organization uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can [use Azure AD groups to assign subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license-bulk#use-azure-active-directory-groups-to-assign-subscriptions) to groups of users.  


## Add a single subscriber
Here's how to assign a Visual Studio subscription to a new user so that they can access the subscription benefits.

1. Sign in to the [administration portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
2. To assign a license to a single Visual Studio subscriber, at the top of the table, select **Add**, then choose **Individual subscriber**.

   > ![Add a single subscriber](_img/assign-license-add/add-subscriber-individual.png)
3. Enter the information into the form fields for the new subscriber. If your organization is using Azure Active Directory, the **Name** field acts as a search function to find people in your current directory so you can select the correct user from the search results. After you select that person, sign-in email and notification email will automatically populate.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In order for members of an Azure Active Directory tenant to be visible when you enter a subscriber name, the administrator must be a member of the tenant. 


    If you want this subscriber to have access to software downloads when they sign into the [Visual Studio Subscriptions Portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs), make sure to leave the downloads toggle enabled in the **Download Settings** section. If you choose to disable downloads, the user will not have access to software downloads.  Access to product keys will also be disabled.  The subscriber will still have access to all other benefits included in the subscription.

    If you'd like to add your own reference notes to the subscription, you can do so in the **Add reference** section.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add your own reference notes to each subscription](media/add-subscriber-reference-notes.png)

    When you're done selecting options and entering data for the subscriber, choose **Add** at the bottom of the **Add Subscriber** fly-out.

   > ![Choose the Add button](media/add-button.png)

## Resend assignment emails
After you add a subscriber, an assignment email will be automatically sent to the new subscriber with further instructions. You can send the assignment email again at any time by selecting the subscriber and clicking the **Resend** button in the top menu.  To resend emails to multiple users, hold down the **Ctrl** key while selecting the subscribers.  When you click the **Resend** button, you'll see a dialog asking you to confirm you want to resend to those subscribers.
