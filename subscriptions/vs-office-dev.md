# The Office 365 Developer subscription benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Subscribers with selected Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions receive the Office 365 Developer Subscription benefit.  The Office 365 Developer Subscription allows you to develop, test, and deploy add-ins for Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint.  This benefit allows for one tenant and up to 25 users.

## Activation steps

1. Visit [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) to sign in to the subscriber portal.

2. Depending on your account, you will either be redirected to your Organization’s sign-in page, or the Microsoft Account sign-in page.   In either case, please enter your username and password, and click **Next**.

3. Once the sign-in process is complete, you should see the Subscriptions Benefits page.  If you have more than one subscription, you can switch between the subscriptions by clicking the drop-down arrow in the top right corner, below the black ribbon.  The Office 365 Developer Subscription benefit tile is in the Tools category.  Use the arrow to the right of the row of tiles to scroll until the Office tile is visible.

4. Locate the Office 365 Developer Subscription tile in the Tools section.  Click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.   When the code has been retrieved, click **Activate**.

8.	Provide a phone number and choose whether to receive a confirmation code via phone or text.  This helps us ensure the account is being created by a real person. Enter the code you receive and click **Next**.

9.	You may be asked to sign in at this point.  If you have more than one account shown on the Office 365 login page, please choose the account you associated with this subscription.

10.	The next page will confirm that your subscription is available to you at no cost.  Click **Next** to continue.

11.	In finalizing "Step 3”, you will be asked to select a "Payment Method.”  There are two Payment Options available.  The first option would be to add a **Credit Card** (as displayed below), and the second option is **Invoice**.  In both cases, a $0.00 order is submitted by clicking **Place Order**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For subscribers who don’t want to provide a Credit Card, select the **Invoice** payment method.  You can also select **Pay by the year** to limit the receipt of invoices to once per year.

12.	At this point, you have successfully redeemed your Office 365 Developer Subscription benefit.  You’ll see a page confirming your order.  The page will provide a link to the [sign-in page](https://portal.office.com "Office 365 sign-in page").  We recommend bookmarking the page for later use.  You’ll also want to record the user ID shown on the page.  (You will also receive a welcome email at the address you provided when you set up the account.)  Click **Start setup** to continue.

1. To increase users after the redemption process has been completed, you will need to visit [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com) and sign in with the “User ID” created during the tenant creation steps.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you’re having trouble finding your sign in information, look in your “Order Confirmation” email sent from the “Microsoft Online Service Team” with the subject “Order Confirmation:  Thank you for your purchase”.  Alternatively, you can also search your inbox for “Body:(Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer MSDN)”.

2. After successful sign in, select the **Admin** tile. You will be redirected to the “Admin Center”.

3. From the left hand navigation panel, click the drop down for **Billing** and choose **Subscriptions**.

4. Locate the Office 365 Enterprise E3 Developer MSDN subscription, and click **Add/ Remove Licenses**.

5. Increase or decrease the **Total users** to the desired value (not to exceed 25), and click **Submit**.

6. The “Purchase” value, as indicated on the “Subscriptions” page, should now match the value submitted.
