1. Open a different browser, such as Microsoft Edge or the latest versions of Google Chrome or Firefox, or Safari.
2. Connect to the Visual Studio [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and sign in.
3. Now click on the **Get started** link on the Visual Studio App Center tile.
