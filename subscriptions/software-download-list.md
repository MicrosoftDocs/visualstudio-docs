# What software is available for download?

The [list of software downloads](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/4/15454442-CF17-47B9-A65D-DF84EF88511B/Visual_Studio_by_Subscription_Level.xlsx) available to you depends on the subscription you're using.  If you have more than one subscription associated with the same sign-in address, you will see the downloads included with the highest level subscription, regardless of which subscription you're viewing.  For example, if you have a Visual Studio Enterprise standard subscription and a Visual Studio Professional subscription, you will see the complete list of downloads available with your Enterprise subscription.  To see the list of your subscriptions, visit [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs).

If you already have a Visual Studio subscription:
1. Go to [https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs)
2. Sign in to your subscription. (Learn more about signing in with your [Microsoft Account](sign-in-msa.md), [work or school account](sign-in-work.md), or [GitHub](sign-in-github.md) credentials.)
3. Upon successful sign-in, you will be able to search for your desired downloads.  You can also see a list of popular downloads, which can be sorted by any of several criteria.

To quickly find products, use the "Search" functions at the top of the page or click on the different product types on the left.

> [!TIP]
> If you're looking for your product keys, click on the **Product Keys** tab at the top of the page.

You can also download an Excel spreadsheet containing an extensive list of [available software titles](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/4/15454442-CF17-47B9-A65D-DF84EF88511B/Visual_Studio_by_Subscription_Level.xlsx) for each subscription type.
