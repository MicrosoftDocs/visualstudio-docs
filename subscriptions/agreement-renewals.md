# What happens when Visual Studio subscription agreements are renewed

When your company renews an agreement that includes Visual Studio subscriptions, what you see in the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) depends on how the renewal was accomplished.  

## Agreement was renewed with the existing agreement number

If your company renewed the existing agreement and the agreement number is unchanged, you see a new agreement end date and all of your subscriptions show an updated expiration date.  You can view information about your agreement by selecting the **Details** button to the far left. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Open the Details pane](_img/agreement-renewals/details-button.png "Screenshot of the Agreement details page. The Agreement details button is highlighted.")

## A new agreement was created

If your company renewed their agreement but you're still seeing the old agreement information, there are a couple of possible causes:
+ You may be viewing the old agreement.  To view the new agreement, select the agreement picker and select the new agreement.  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Agreement picker](_img/agreement-renewals/agreement-picker.png "Screenshot of the manage subscribers page of the management portal. The agreement picker is highlighted.")
+ You may not be listed as an admin on the new agreement.  If you don't see any new agreements listed in the agreement picker, you need to contact a super admin to be granted permissions to the new agreement number.
