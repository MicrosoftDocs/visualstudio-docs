# What happens when Visual Studio subscription agreements are renewed
When your company renews an agreement that includes Visual Studio subscriptions, what you see in the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) will depend on how the renewal was accomplished.  

## Agreement was renewed with the existing agreement number
If your company renewed the existing agreement and the agreement number is unchanged, you will see a new agreement end date and all of your subscriptions will show an updated expiration date.  You can view information about your agreement by clicking on the **Details** button to the far left. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Open the Details pane](_img/agreement-renewals/details-button.png "Click the Details button to see your agreement information.")

## A new agreement was created
If your company renewed their agreement but you are still seeing the old agreement information, there are a couple of possible causes:
- You may be viewing the old agreement.  To view the new agreement, click on the agreement picker and select the new agreement.  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Agreement picker](_img/agreement-renewals/agreement-picker.png "Click the agreement picker to select from available agreements.")
- You may not be listed as an admin on the new agreement.  If you don't see any new agreements listed in the agreement picker, you need to contact a super admin to be granted permissions to the new agreement number.
