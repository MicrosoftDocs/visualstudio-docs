# Export subscription information

In the Visual Studio Subscriptions [Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), you can export a list of your subscribers with details about their subscriptions.  All of the fields in the subscriber list in the admin portal are included in the exported list. 

Having all your subscriber information in one place can help you do things like:
+ Get an overall view of which subscriptions are in use by team and/or location across your organization.
+ Develop plans and budgets for future subscription purchases. 
+ Encourage users who have subscriptions assigned to activate.
+ Identify where subscriptions may be over-allocated. 
+ Assign subscriptions using the subscription ID to control which expiration date your subscribers have on their subscriptions.
+ Migrate subscriptions from expiring agreements to new ones.  

## Export your subscriptions

To perform the export:
1. Sign in to the [Admin Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
2. Select the **Export** tab. The file downloads to your local machine. The file includes the name of the agreement that contains your user subscriptions, and the date of the export.

3. The exported list appears as a .csv file in your normal downloads location. The file name includes the agreement number and the date you exported the list.
