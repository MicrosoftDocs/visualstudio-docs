# Activate and use the Technical Support benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions
The Technical Support benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions is for resolving break-fix issues in **non-production environments** for products that are still in the mainstream support phase of the [support lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search). Visual Studio Enterprise standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive four incidents, while Visual Studio Professional standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive two incidents, for up to 1 year from benefit activation. Benefit activation must occur while the subscription is current.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio Professional Annual subscriptions and Visual Studio Enterprise Annual subscriptions in Cloud Subscriptions. There will be no change to existing customers experience and ability to renew, increase, decrease, or cancel their subscriptions. New customers are encouraged to go to <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/> to explore different options to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all subscriptions at a given level are eligible to receive support incidents. Subscriptions acquired through FTE, NFR, MPN, MCT and other programs do not receive support incidents. If your subscription is not eligible to receive technical support incidents, the Technical Support tile will not appear in your available benefits.

**To submit a support request using the benefit, you must first activate it.  Follow the steps in the next section to complete the activation.**

## Supported products 
Developer Tools such as the Visual Studio IDE and Azure DevOps Server will receive both mainstream and extended support through Visual Studio subscriptions.

Non-developer products (such as SQL, Windows, SharePoint) downloaded from Visual Studio subscriptions are eligible only for mainstream support. These products are only licensed for development environments to design, develop, test, or demonstrate applications. These products are not licensed for production environments.

Product level descriptions: Expand **Unavailable support plans**. If you see **Support plan cannot be used for support on the specified product (Code: 8)**, your support contract cannot be used for the product version you selected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The support incidents provided are for break-fix support.  They may not be used for assistance with coding/development issues involving the following products:
> - Microsoft Teams
> - Microsoft Office
> - Microsoft SharePoint
> - Microsoft Exchange
> - Microsoft Graph
> - Microsoft Outlook

## How to activate the benefit
1. Go to <https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits>, scroll down to the Support section and on the Technical Support tile click **Chat to activate**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Technical Support Benefit Tile](_img/vs-tech-support/vs-tech-support-tile.png "Click 'Chat to activate' on the Technical Support tile.")
2. This will initiate a chat session with a representative who can create your **Contract ID** and **Access ID** and provide those to you via email so you will have them for your records.

3. To complete the process, you will need to provide the representative with:
   - Your country/region
   - Company name
   - Your full name
   - The email address you use to sign in to your subscription
   - The Subscription ID, which can be found on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) tab.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Technical Support Benefit Find Subscription ID](_img/vs-tech-support/vs-tech-support-subID-cropped.png "Find your subscription ID on the Subscriptions tab.")

4. After the process is completed, you will receive an email containing your **Contract ID** and **Access ID** you will use when creating a support incident.  It will also provide instructions for submitting support incidents using your new Access ID and Contract ID. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > To activate your support account in a language other than English, choose your country/region from [this list](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14084/activate-support-contract).
