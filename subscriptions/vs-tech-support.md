# Activate and use the Technical Support benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

The Technical Support benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions is for resolving break-fix issues in **non-production environments** for products that are still in the mainstream support phase of the [support lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search). Visual Studio Enterprise standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive four incidents, while Visual Studio Professional standard and annual cloud subscriptions receive two incidents, for up to one year from benefit activation. Benefit activation must occur while the subscription is current.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio Professional Annual subscriptions and Visual Studio Enterprise Annual subscriptions in Cloud Subscriptions. There's no change to existing customers experience and ability to renew, increase, decrease, or cancel their subscriptions. New customers are encouraged to go to <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/> to explore different options to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all subscriptions at a given level are eligible to receive support incidents. Subscriptions acquired through Full Time Employee (FTE), Not For Resale (NFR), Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program (MAICPP), Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), and other programs don't receive support incidents. If your subscription isn't eligible to receive technical support incidents, the Technical Support tile isn't displayed among your benefits.

## Supported products 

Developer Tools such as the Visual Studio IDE and Azure DevOps Server receive both mainstream and extended support through Visual Studio subscriptions.

Nondeveloper products (such as SQL, Windows, SharePoint) downloaded from Visual Studio subscriptions are eligible only for mainstream support. These products are only licensed for development environments to design, develop, test, or demonstrate applications. These products aren't licensed for production environments.

Product level descriptions: Expand **Unavailable support plans**. If you see **Support plan cannot be used for support on the specified product (Code: 8)**, your support contract can't be used for the product version you selected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The support incidents provided are for break-fix support. They might not be used for assistance with coding/development issues involving the following products:
> - Microsoft Teams
> - Microsoft Office
> - Microsoft SharePoint
> - Microsoft Exchange
> - Microsoft Graph
> - Microsoft Outlook

## How to activate the benefit

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps apply to activation of the benefit in **English** only. For other languages, visit <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support>, scroll to the bottom, and select **Account, Subscription and Billing Support** and then select your country/region from the drop-down list.

1. Go to <https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits>, scroll down to the Support section, and on the Technical Support tile select **Chat to activate**.

    > ![Technical Support Benefit Tile](_img/vs-tech-support/vs-tech-support-tile.png "Screenshot of the Technical Support tile. The chat to activate button is highlighted.")
2. You join a chat session with a representative who can create your **Contract ID** and **Access ID** and provide those numbers to you via email so you have them for your records.

3. To complete the process, you need to provide the representative with:
   + Your country/region
   + Company name
   + Your full name
   + The email address you use to sign in to your subscription
   + The Subscription ID, which can be found on the [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) tab.

   > ![Technical Support Benefit Find Subscription ID](_img/vs-tech-support/vs-tech-support-subID-cropped.png "Screenshot of the subscriptions page. An example of a subscription ID is highlighted.")

4. After the process is completed, you receive an email containing your **Contract ID** and **Access ID** you use when creating a support incident. It also provides instructions for submitting support incidents using your new Access ID and Contract ID. 

## How to submit an incident using your benefit

**To submit a support request using the benefit, you must first activate it.  Follow the steps in the previous section to complete the activation.**

When you have your **Contract ID** and **Access ID** set up, you can use it to submit a Tech Support incident.
