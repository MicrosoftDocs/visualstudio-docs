# Pluralsight training benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Advance your skills with expert-authored courses, learning paths, adaptive skills measurement, and more. Take your learning to the next level with up to six months of access to the Pluralsight technical skills platform. Master Azure, C#, Angular, ASP.NET Core, and other trending technologies. Assess your skills and learn from industry experts to fill any gaps.

The [eligibility table](#eligibility) details the Pluralsight training benefit that's available with select Visual Studio subscriptions. 

Some Pluralsight subscribers also can take advantage of limited courses after their benefit subscription to the full Pluralsight catalog expires. When your full catalog Pluralsight benefit subscription expires, Pluralsight guides eligible subscribers through the process of limited, continued access. If you aren't eligible to redeem more Pluralsight training benefits after your initial benefit subscription expires, a notification gives you this information if you attempt to activate benefits on the Pluralsight website.

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: I have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, but I don't see the Pluralsight tile on the Benefits page. What's wrong?

A: Not all Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions include the Pluralsight benefit. Check the [eligibility table](#eligibility) to see whether your subscription is eligible.

### Q: Can I use the Pluralsight benefit more than once?

A:  The Pluralsight benefit in select Visual Studio subscriptions renews when your subscription renews. For example, if you have an annual subscription that you renew each year, the benefit is available to you each year when you renew. If you have a multi-year subscription, the Pluralsight benefit is available to you once during the term of the subscription. If you renew a multi-year subscription, the benefit is available again after the renewal. To find your renewal date, go to [Visual Studio Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and select **Support Information**. Under **Valid through**, check the date.

### Q: Do I have access to any customized learning playlists or channels?

A: Yes. As a Visual Studio subscriber, you get access to featured roles, learning paths, and custom channels (playlists) as part of your Pluralsight training benefit. Microsoft and Pluralsight specifically curate featured content for learning in key areas of interest. Activate your Pluralsight benefit through [Visual Studio Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) to access learning content on your Pluralsight profile.

### Q: The Pluralsight benefit tile doesn't have an Activate link. How can I activate the benefit?

A:  If you've already activated your Pluralsight benefit, the **Activate** link is replaced with a link that takes you to the sign-in page for Pluralsight. You see the date you activated the benefit and information about how much time remains on your subscription. If you've already used Pluralsight benefits for a Visual Studio subscription, you can't activate benefits again unless you renew the subscription.

### Q: What happens when my Pluralsight benefit ends?

A:  At the end of your free Pluralsight subscription, you might choose to purchase a subscription directly from Pluralsight and continue your training. For full details, contact [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com).
