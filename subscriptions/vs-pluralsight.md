# Pluralsight training benefits in Visual Studio subscriptions

Advance your skills with expert-authored courses, learning paths, adaptive skill measurement, and more!  Depending on which Visual Studio subscription or program membership you have, you may be eligible for up to six months of free, unlimited access to the entire Pluralsight catalog.

The table below details what Pluralsight subscription benefits are available to each Visual Studio subscription type.  Some subscribers will also be able to take advantage of limited courses after their full catalog access subscription expires. Pluralsight will guide you through that process when your full catalog subscription expires.

 Depending on the type of subscription they have, not all subscribers who have previously used a Pluralsight subscription provided through a Visual Studio subscription will be able to redeem new Pluralsight benefit offers. If you are not eligible to redeem additional Pluralsight training benefits, you'll receive a notification when you attempt to activate the benefit on the Pluralsight website.

## Activation steps
1. To activate your subscription, connect to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and click on the **Get code** link on the Pluralsight benefit tile, located in the Professional Development section.

   >
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > When you click on the "Get Code" link on the Pluralsight benefit tile, you may receive the following message:
   >
   > **"Please note:   If you have previously activated a different Pluralsight offer through your Visual Studio subscription, this code may not enable you to create a new Pluralsight account."**

2. You’ll receive a notification that the coupon code has been successfully retrieved.  Click **Activate**.

3. You'll be redirected to the Pluralsight page for the benefit that's included with your Visual Studio subscription.
   - Provide the contact information requested on the form
   - Click the checkbox to accept the terms of use and privacy policy
   - Click **I agree, activate benefit**.

5. It may take a moment to set up your account.  Once that's complete, you'll see a confirmation on the page, and will receive an email with your login information.  The email will be sent to the alias you specified when you created the account.  Be sure to check your junk or spam mail folders if you have trouble finding the message.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your account is not eligible to redeem new offers, the email you receive will explain that there was a problem creating your account because it's not eligible.  It will also contain information to help you contact Pluralsight's support team, who can answer any questions you may have about your account.
   

6. After your account has been successfully created, the email you receive will contain your username, and ask you to create a password.  Provide your password, enter it again to confirm it, and click **Log in to Pluralsight**.

7. Enter the username provided in the welcome email, and the password you just created, and click **Sign in**.

8. That's it!  You're now ready to start learning with thousands of Pluralsight courses!
