# Search and filter subscribers in Visual Studio subscriptions

The Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal allows you to find a specific subset of subscribers based on various criteria. You can filter the subscriber list by name, email address, subscription level, and other information.

1. To search for a specific group of subscribers, select **Filter**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Filter to search a subscriber list](media/filter-list.png)

2. Enter the criteria you would like to use as the basis of your search, and then select **Filter** again.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Use the available fields to filter the subscriber data](media/filter-subscribers.png)

   Your subscriber list then matches the criteria that you chose.
