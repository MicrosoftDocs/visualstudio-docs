# The LinkedIn Learning benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Unlock the power of LinkedIn with access to the people, insights, and skills you need to advance your career. Learn the most in-demand business, tech, and creative skills from industry experts.

Selected Visual Studio subscriptions include a subscription to LinkedIn Premium, which includes LinkedIn Learning. The length of your Premium subscription depends on the type of Visual Studio subscription you have.

You need to have a LinkedIn account to take advantage of your LinkedIn Learning benefit. If you don't have one already, you have a chance to create one before you activate your Premium subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These offer can't be combined with other LinkedIn Learning offers. No more than two of these offers might be claimed in a single calendar year, regardless of source.
