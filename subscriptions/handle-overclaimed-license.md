# Over-allocated subscriptions
Sometimes orders are changed after subscribers have been added, which can result in having more assigned subscriptions than licenses owned by your company. This is called "over-allocation".  

To see your subscription allocations, click on the top icon at the left to open the allocations pane.  

> [!NOTE]
> Over-allocations are not allowed in Open License programs.  Also, other programs may display this information in the portal differently.

> ![Notice of Over-claimed Subscriptions](_img/over-claimed/over-claimed-alert.png "The number of over-allocations is listed in the overview, and is represented by the hashed bar on the graph for each subscription type.")

Notice that the display uses a hashed bar to indicate over-allocated subscriptions.  The number of over-allocations across all subscription types is included in the Overview section at the top, and each subscription level also displays its own allocation status.  

## Resolve over-allocated subscriptions
There are several ways to resolve over-allocations:
- Contact your reseller to purchase additional subscriptions.
- Wait until your annual true-up period and pay for the over-allocated subscriptions at that point. 
- Delete some subscription assignments.  (This will not prevent the need for payment at the annual true-up as the true-up is based on the maximum number of subscriptions assigned at any time during the year.)

## Billing and true-up
If your organization has an Enterprise Agreement (EA), admins are able to assign subscriptions without purchasing them, and pay for them later through a reconciliation process known as a "true-up".  When you over-allocate, your organization will be billed for the maximum number of subscriptions assigned to users during the "true-up".  This is true even if you no longer have the maximum number of subscriptions assigned at the time the true-up takes place.  To learn more about monitoring your maximum usage, visit the [Maximum Usage](maximum-usage.md) topic.
